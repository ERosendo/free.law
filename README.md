# Free Law Project Website

This is [the website for Free Law Project][fl]. Like the rest of our work, it is developed in the open and can be edited by other people, like you. See a typo? Fix it! Want to make the site look better? Go for it!

This site uses the [Pelican static site generator][pelican], which means that there is no database, no dynamic code on the site, aside from what JavaScript can do in your browser. The entire site is here -- in Github -- and you can render it yourself, work on it locally, and even host it on your own server if you wanted to (though we'd send our shark lawyers after you).


## Installation

If you want to work on the site, the thing to do is install the dependencies. All of them are Python dependencies, so if you have Python installed, you can probably do this pretty quickly.

1. Optional but recommended: Make a virtualenv and activate it.

    If you don't know how to do this or why you'd want to, it's something that you'll want to learn eventually, but you can probably skip this step if you just want to get to blogging. Skipping this step may cause problems, but probably won't. If you want to learn more about virtualenv and its virtues, [it's a pretty quick read][venv]. I also recommend [virtualenvwrapper][wrap], which makes virtualenv easier to use. It's not essential though.

1. Download this repository:

    If you don't have [Git][g], install it, then run:

        git clone https://github.com/freelawproject/free.law.git

1. Install the requirements file:

    If you're using virtualenv, make sure it's activated, then:

        cd free.law
        pip install -r requirements.txt

1. Install the `pelican-plugins` in a directory next to your current directory.

        cd ..
        git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins.git

    You will now have all the dependencies installed.

1. Most people can skip this step, but if you're somebody that has permission to push the content to Amazon, configure the two Amazon tools by running:

        s3cmd --configure

    This will ask for your Access Key and Secret key, [which are at this link][keys].

    Configure the second tool with:

        aws configure

    Tell it your access and secret keys as well, and leave the region and output format blank. Then enable preview features by running:

        aws configure set preview.cloudfront true

You're done!


## Writing a post or a page

Posts are easy to write, but to make it even easier, there's [a template called example.md][ex]. Make a copy of that file with a descriptive name and put it in the `content` directory &mdash; If you're doing a blog post, you can usually just put it directly in the `content` directory; pages go in the `pages` directory. Pages usually get a custom slug instead of having it auto-generated from their title (see other examples). 
 
With that in place, write your post [in markdown][md] in that file and generate the HTML when you think your post is ready (read on for how to do that).

You should put some tags on your post. Unfortunately there's no easy way to skim our existing tags, but you can grep the code for ideas or just go for it and we'll just live with it being a messy [folksonomy][f]. After you've created the content once, you can look in the `output/tag` directory, where all the existing tags are listed, if you care. Not a big deal here.

Finally, it should go without saying, but if you see something on the live site that you want to replicate, just search through this repository for words in the post and you'll find the markdown file that made that page.


## Generating HTML Content from Markdown Files

If you want to see your work, activate your virtualenv if you're using one, get yourself into the root of this repository, then run a command like:

    pelican content -s pelicanconf.py -d -r

This will use the development settings (`-s pelicanconf.py`) to delete the output directory before recreating it (`-d`), and will automatically regenerate the content whenever it changes (`-r`).

Once the generation is done, the content is in the `output` directory. If you're writing a draft, it will be in the `output/drafts` folder.

Feel free to look at the other options the `pelican` command provides. Some, like caching, are pretty useful.


## Running a development server

To see the content in your browser, run your generation command with:

    --listen --port 8080

That will run a little server on your computer that you can visit at http://localhost:8080. When you do, it should look pretty much exactly like what's on https://free.law. 


## Tweaking the default theme

All of its code is in the `themes` directory. Go for it.


## Pushing content to Amazon (Publishing Your Work)

To publish your post, simply run:

    make s3_upload

This will regenerate the site using the `publishconf.py` file, then will sync it with Amazon, pushing anything new and deleting anything old.

Note that if you're updating an item, you may have to wait for cache invalidation to occur before you'll see your changes. The cache is cleared automatically when you run `s3_upload`, but it can take a few minutes (sometimes up to ten) for the cache to clear everywhere.


# Infrastructure

There are a lot of pieces in this puzzle, so this is where they are documented. The set up that we have was [inspired greatly by the post here][1].

Requests to the naked domain do this:

    Route 53 (DNS) --> CloudFront Distribution --> S3 Bucket (free.law)

Requests to the www subdomain (hopefully a corner case) do this:

    Route 53 (DNS) --> CloudFront WWW Distribution -->
    S3 Bucket (www.free.law) --> Redirects to naked domain --> Route 53 -->
    CloudFront Distribution (Redirects HTTP to HTTPS) --> S3 Bucket (free.law)

This means that there are essentially two parallel set ups for DNS (Route 53), Content Distribution (CloudFront) and File Serving (S3). Redirections from HTTP to HTTPS are configured in CloudFront. Redirections from www happen in an empty S3 bucket specifically for this purpose.

SSL is configured in Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM), which will handle auto-renewals and hopefully everything else.

All in all, this is a pretty killer set up. Most clients will get served by CloudFront and it will be incredibly fast. Clients that go to http://www.free.law will suffer three redirections:

 - First they get redirected to https://www.free.law
 - Then they get redirected to http://free.law
 - Finally, they get redirected to https://free.law

Life is hard for these people.

There is another weak point in this configuration. The connection between CloudFront and S3 is *not* encrypted. Pretty lame, but the reason for this is that you have to use the Static Site URL as the Origin that feeds into CloudFront, and that URL doesn't support SSL even though the S3 URLs do.
