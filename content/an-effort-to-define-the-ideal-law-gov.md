A [group of academics](http://resource.org/law.gov/) has been convened
by [Public.Resource.Org](http://resource.org/) in order to define
recommendations for a proposed federal government site: law.gov. The
group will study the feasibility of creating the equivalent of a
data.gov for legal materials. The process will define a concrete path
forward forward for the government. Specifically, it will deliver:

-   Detailed technical specifications for markup, authentication, bulk
    access, and other aspects of a distributed registry.
-   A bill of lading defining which materials should be made available
    on the system.
-   A detailed business plan and budget for the organization in the
    government running the new system.
-   Sample enabling legislation.
-   An economic impact statement detailing the effect on federal
    spending and economic activity.
-   Procedures for auditing materials on the system to
    ensure authenticity.

Ed Felten, Executive Director of Princeton's Center for Information
Technology Policy (which also produced RECAP), is one of the
co-conveners.
