A quick announcement today to share that we're making [Free.law][1] our new home and that we're launching a new homepage to go with it. If you're reading this post, you're looking at the new site! Let us know what you think or if we can improve it somehow. For the most part, it's a replica of our old site, but we've made a few improvements here and there. In general, the layout, typography, security, speed, and reliability should all be better.

In addition to the new homepage being live, we also updated our email, so you can now reach us at *somebody@free.law*.

We love preserving digital artifacts, so here's a screenshot of the old site:

*FreeLawProject.org, v1. You can also browse the old site at [archive.org][ia].*

For the technically curious, this new site uses the [Pelican Static Site Generator][p], and runs on the Amazon Web Services stack. This means that it will be incredibly fast no matter where you are in the world, it should never go down, and it allows us to secure the page behind HTTPS. If you want more details, you can find them in the ["Infrastructure" section of the readme][i].

If you have any comments or ideas about making the site better, [get in touch][contact]!
