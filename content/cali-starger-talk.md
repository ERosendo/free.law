Last week was a busy one for Free Law Project. While I was at the [LTDCA conference][1] in San Diego, presenting on our [database of judges][jdb], [Colin Starger][starger] of University of Baltimore School of Law was at the [annual CALI conference][cali] talking about our new [Supreme Court citation visualizations][viz].

While my talk wasn't recorded, Colin's was, and you can [watch it now][video]. He's also got [a great post on his blog][colin-blog] that has lots more information about the talk and his process. Both are a great way to get started with our [Supreme Court visualizations][viz]. Enjoy!
