Today a group of non-proft public interest organizations have released
updated Best-Practices Language for Making Government Data
"License-Free." Free Law Project is glad to sign on to their statement
and to support the effort to assist government agencies in making clear
that their data is free of copyright or contractual restrictions and can
be re-used freely.
