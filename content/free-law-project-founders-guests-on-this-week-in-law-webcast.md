Brian and I were guests this week on the live Internet show, [This Week
in Law](http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-law) on the [Twit
Network](http://twit.tv). In the show we cover a number of topics
ranging from the history of Free Law Project and the need for innovation
in the legal arena to the copyright and trademark issues in the latest
Deadmou5 brouhaha.
