Yesterday the impressive [DC Legal Hackers
group](http://dclegalhackers.org/) held their first annual [Le Hackie
Awards and Holiday
Party](http://www.meetup.com/DCLegalHackers/events/193499902/). Although
we weren't able to attend the event (it was in D.C.), we're proud and
gratified to share that Free Law Project played a part in two of the top
ten legal hacks of the year. The first was for our new Oral Arguments
feature that we've been blogging so much about lately, and the second
was for [Frank Bennett's Free Law
Ferret](http://citationstylist.org/2013/08/20/free-law-ferret-document-to-cited-cases-in-a-click/),
which he built using code originally developed for CourtListener.

**Update:** Turns out the Free Law Ferret was from 2013 and was not
awarded a Le Hackie Award. Our mistake was to trust a slide from the
presentation, which contained a typo.

Brian and I couldn't be happier to see the legal hacking community grow
and we're humbled to be a part of it. So much fantastic work is getting
done each year, and the legal arena is growing and maturing at a
feverish pace. We hope that the DC Legal Hackers will keep up their
great work and that next year the board will be plastered with even
better hacks.
