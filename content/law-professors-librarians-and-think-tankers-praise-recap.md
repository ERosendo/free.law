We've been getting a ton of helpful feedback from users over the
weekend. We're grateful for all the supportive emails, comments, and
tweets we've received. We're also grateful for the bug reports and
feature requests we've gotten. We need this kind of feedback to make
RECAP better.

Most of the questions we've received are are now answered by our
[Frequently Asked Questions][faq]. Stay tuned for some upcoming
blog posts where we'll address some of these questions in more detail.
But first, we wanted to highlight some more of the commentary that
RECAP's release has generated.

James Grimmelmann, a law professor at New York Law School who has done
some [great
writing](http://james.grimmelmann.net/essays/CopyrightTechnologyAccess)
on public access to the law, gives RECAP [this generous
endorsement](http://laboratorium.net/archive/2009/08/14/pacer_meet_recap):

> The great part about this is that because the Archive is providing the
> server space for free, every RECAP user is saving the court system
> work. Each time you download through RECAP, you avoid having to go
> through PACER’s servers at all. So yes, RECAP will mean a decrease in
> PACER’s revenues, but it also means a decrease in the things those
> revenues need to pay for. It’s an all-around good thing. It saves
> attorneys, researchers, and citizens money. It saves the government
> computer resources. And it makes the law just a little bit more free
> and accessible.

We couldn't have put it better ourselves.

Ryan Singel of *Wired* calls RECAP ["a pretty good
hack,"](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/firefox-plug-in-frees-court-records-threatens-judiciary-profits/)
and urges the judiciary to drop its paywall. The Lawyerist blog
[says](http://lawyerist.com/liberate-pacer-documents-with-recap-firefox-extension/)
that RECAP is a "brilliantly-conceived tool to liberate public records
from PACER."

RECAP seems to be especially popular among law librarians. Erika Wayne,
a law librarian at Stanford University,
[writes](http://legalresearchplus.com/2009/08/14/recap-turning-pacer-around/)
of RECAP: "Be impressed. Very impressed." We also got a favorable
write-up from the [University of Wisconsin law
library](http://www.law.wisc.edu/blogs/wisblawg/2009/08/recap_firefox_addon_access_pac.html)
and a mention from the [Georgetown law
library.](http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/blog/index.cfm/2009/8/14/Better-Access-to-Public-Court-Records)

RECAP is also popular among DC-area think tanks. Heather West at the
Center for Democracy and Technology
[calls](http://blog.cdt.org/2009/08/14/the-courts-should-keep-paceer/)
RECAP "exactly the kind of project that we need" to promote judicial
transparency. Jerry Brito of the Mercatus Center at George Mason
University, an [early
advocate](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1023485) of
online transparency,
[calls](http://techliberation.com/2009/08/14/recap-needs-your-help-turning-around-pacer/)
RECAP "ingenious." And we got a
[mention](http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/08/14/techliberationfront-turns-five/)
from Jim Harper of the Cato Institute.

Finally, we were particularly happy to get
[coverage](http://www.abajournal.com/news/tired_of_paying_for_pacer_docs_princeton_group_offers_alternative/)
from the American Bar Association's ABA Journal blog. Practicing lawyers
are the heaviest users of PACER, so it's extremely helpful to have RECAP
covered by influential legal publications.
