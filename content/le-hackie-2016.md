The "hack" that we received this award for was our series of blog posts about PACER:
 
 - [How Much Money Does PACER Make?][how-much]
 
 - [The Cost of PACER Data? Around One Billion Dollars.][billion]
 
 - [Downloading Important Cases on PACER Costs More than a Brand New Car][car]
 
 - [What is a "Page" of PACER Content?][page]

And our older pieces:

 - [What is the "PACER Problem"?][wrong]
 
 - [What Should be Done About the PACER Problem?][what]

D.C. Legal Hackers is an amazing group, and we're really proud to get this award from them.
