We're happy to share three pieces of news about [oral arguments at
CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&type=oa&order_by=dateArgued+desc).

**First**, the sixth circuit has begun putting oral argument audio [on
their
website](http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/court_audio/aud1.php) and
we have begun dishing it up through CourtListener. We briefly spoke to
the technology team at the court and their reaction to our questions
about their system was, "Oh, is that on our website already?" So this is
a very new development, even for them.

Right now their site has oral argument audio back to August 7th and we
are in the process of grabbing this audio and putting it in our archive.
Unfortunately, the case in the news right now [that's blocking gay
marriage in the
circuit](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2748945/valeria-tanco-v-william-haslam/)
was argued one day prior to the oldest files they've posted, and so we
don't have audio for that case, and possibly never will. This is one big
reason we've wanted to get into oral arguments on CourtListener and why
we've been supported with a grant from Columbia Library to do this work:
This content is simply going dark as new content is published.

While we're happy to now be collecting data from the 6th Circuit, it's
still disappointing that we don't have it from the Second, Tenth, or
Eleventh Circuit, as they do not (yet) publish their oral argument
audio. We simply have to hope that the content is being stored
*somewhere* and that we'll get it eventually. (If you're reading this
and have connections in those courts, we'd love to hear from you.)

A **second** piece of news is that we just added [our 1,000th oral
argument](https://www.courtlistener.com/audio/1000/dennis-v-secretary-pa-dept/)
since beginning eight days ago! This is already more than 40GB of data
-- a harbinger of complex systems problems to come, but we're excited to
be collecting so much so quickly and we hope you'll create some podcasts
or alerts for what we have.

Our **final** piece of news today is that our oral argument podcasts are
now available on [Stitcher](http://www.stitcher.com/). If you have a
smartphone and enjoy podcasts, simply search for CourtListener in the
Stitcher app, and our podcasts will come right up.
