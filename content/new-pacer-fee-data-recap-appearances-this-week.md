This week, RECAP team member Steve Schultze released new data on how
PACER fees are collected and spent in a post entitled, "[What Does It
Cost to Provide Electronic Public Access to Court
Records?](http://managingmiracles.blogspot.com/2010/05/what-is-electronic-public-access-to.html)"
He will discuss this new data and other aspects of public access to
federal case materials at a [Law.gov event in DC
tomorrow](http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2010/06/lawgov.html)
(live streaming video). Steve will also be on a panel at the [Virginia
State Bar Association's annual
meeting](http://www.vsb.org/special-events/annual-meeting/index.php) on
Thursday, speaking about how the federal electronic filing experience
can inform state efforts. That same day, RECAP developer Dhruv Kapadia
will be at the [Law.gov event at
Harvard](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/2010/06/lawdotgov).

There will be more RECAP developments and public appearances in the
coming weeks.

**Update:** The video for the [Law.Gov Event at the Center for American
Progress](http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2010/06/lawgov.html) is
now posted on their site. You can watch the excerpt of Steve's remarks
