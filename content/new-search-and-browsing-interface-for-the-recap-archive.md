One of the most-requested RECAP features is a better web interface to
the archive. Today we're releasing an experimental system for searching
and browsing, at
[archive.recapthelaw.org](http://archive.recapthelaw.org). There are
also a couple of extra features that we're eager to get feedback on. For
example, you can subscribe to an RSS feed for any case in order to get
updates when new documents are added to the archive. We've also included
some basic tagging features that lets anybody add tags to any case.
We're sure that there will be bugs to be fixed or improvements that can
be made. Please [let us
know](http://recapthelaw.uservoice.com/pages/26501-general).

The first version of the system was built by an enterprising team of
students in Professor Ed Felten's ["Civic Technologies"
course](http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S26/26/29G42/index.xml?section=featured):
Jen King, Brett Lullo, Sajid Mehmood, and Daniel Mattos Roberts. Dhruv
Kapadia has done many of the subsequent updates. The links from the
Recap Archive pages point to files on our gracious host, the [Internet
Archive](http://www.archive.org/details/usfederalcourts).

See, for example, the [RECAP Archive page for United States of America
v. Arizona, State of, et
al](http://archive.recapthelaw.org/azd/535000/). This is the Arizona
District Court case in which the judge last week issued an order
granting injunction against several portions of the controversial
immigration law. As you can see, some of the documents have a "Download"
link that allows you to directly download the document from the Internet
Archive, whereas others have a "Buy from PACER" link because no RECAP
users have yet liberated the document.
