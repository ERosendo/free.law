We are happy to share that as of today, oral argument recordings from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals are finally available on CourtListener.com. This means that you can [search these recordings][search], [create email alerts for them][alerts], listen to them on our site, and even include them in [custom podcasts][2]. Of course, we also provide enhanced versions of these recordings for download, and for developers or researchers they're also available as [bulk data or via our APIs][api].

Before today, we were unable to provide these features for the Second Circuit because they [didn't post their oral argument recordings on their website][1], so we're thrilled that they've begun doing so. At this point, only the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits do not post their oral argument recordings, but we are hopeful that they will follow the lead of the other circuits and begin doing so soon.
