After three months of hard development, I'm pleased to announce that the
new version of CourtListener is going live at this very moment. In this
version, we've completely rewritten vast swaths of the underlying code,
and we've switched to a hugely more powerful architecture.

The new site comes with some significant improvements:

-   You can now search by casename, date, court, precedential status or
    citation
-   Results can be ordered by date or by relevance
-   New Boolean operators are supported, and our syntax is much more
    intuitive (see here for many more details)
-   If you want, you can now dig very deeply into the results.
    Previously, we had a cap at 1,000 results for a query. Not any more.
-   Court documents will now show up in our search results within
    milliseconds of being found on the court's website. In the future,
    if there's demand, we may use this to offer Realtime alerts.
-   We now have snippets and highlighting on our results page.
-   Finally, some polish everywhere to make things prettier.
-   Huge performance improvements.
-   Better support for mobile devices and tablets.
-   Better support for disabled people, and users that prefer not to use
    JavaScript.

And that just scratches the surface. This has been a HUGE rewrite of
nearly all parts of the site, and we hope that you'll be as excited
about it as we are.

As of this moment, the our search index is getting built for the first
time, so we won't have all of our 600,000 cases available for a few
hours. All cases are available though via their permalink.

We look forward to your feedback as we roll out the new version!
