For a long time we've had a feature that allowed you to look at the
items that cite an opinion, letting you to look into the future and see
what cases found it important down the line. As of today, we're
announcing the complimentary feature that allows easy travel into the
past. Starting immediately, when you look at almost any case in our
collection you'll see an Authorities section in its sidebar.

For example, [*Roe v.
Wade*](https://www.courtlistener.com/scotus/yjn/roe-v-wade/) looks like
this:

![authorities-sidebar-example]({static}/images/authorities-sidebar.png)

This section shows the top five opinions that were cited by the one you
are looking at. If you wish to see all of the opinions it cited there is
a link at the bottom that takes you to the new [Table of
Authorities](https://www.courtlistener.com/scotus/yjn/roe-v-wade/authorities/)
page, which shows everything:

![authorities
table]({static}/images/authorities-table.png)

Now, when you're looking at an opinion, you can easily travel through
time to either opinions that came later or ones that came before. [Doc
Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5cYgRnfFDA) would be proud.
