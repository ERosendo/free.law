We've talked many times in the past about [how difficult PACER is to use][pacer-vid] and about [what you can do to help fix PACER][todo]. As we gear up for our new PACER Clearinghouse, we're writing a few more posts about PACER so that people can wrap their minds around just how bad it is. Today, I want to talk briefly about how the PACER search interface contradicts with well-known information retrieval best practices.

Before we can delve into information retrieval best practices, we need to look for a moment at the purpose of PACER, as described by Congress in the e-Government act of 2002.
