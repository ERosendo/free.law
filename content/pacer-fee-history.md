Today, the PACER system contains millions of court filings for the federal district, circuit, and bankruptcy courts, most of which are sold at a dime per page with a three dollar cap per document. But content in PACER was not always priced this way, and indeed the PACER system goes back all the way to the early 1990's, before computers were generally connected to the Internet.
 
Fees for using PACER are set by the [Judicial Conference of the Administrative Office of the Courts][jc], which scrupulously [keeps notes from its bi-annual proceedings][pro] going back to its creation in 1922. In this post, we have gone through all of the relevant proceedings, and we present what we believe is a complete history of PACER fees and changes.
  
During the 27 year history outlined below, technology has changed significantly, and the Administrative Office of the Courts has done its best to keep up. Over the years, PACER has offered a variety of ways to get court information. These include a 1-900 number, a search service available via a regular phone call, the ability to connect your own computer directly to the courts', and the websites that we know today.
 
But regardless of the tool, one thing has always been a constant. With few exceptions, fees have consistently played a major part in funding electronic access to court records. 

Read on to learn the full history. 

-----

The first reference to PACER is in the **March, 1990** proceedings of the Judicial Conference, in which fees are set for using, "a personal computer to access a court's computer and extract public data":

**March, 1991** --- The Judicial Conference learns that maintaining PACER accounts is impacting clerks' offices, and a 1-900 number is established at $1/minute.

**September, 1993** --- Although the Judicial Conference believes that fees should be consistent across federal district, bankruptcy, and appeals courts, it is decided *not* to implement an electronic access fee at the appeals courts due to their use of a different system called "Appellate Court Electronic Services" née "Electronic Dissemination of Opinions System" (EDOS). This decision is reversed a year later.
