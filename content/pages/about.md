Title: About Free Law Project
Slug: about

Started in 2010, Free Law Project is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that works to make the legal world more fair and efficient. We do this through a number of projects including:

 - [The RECAP Extensions][recap] &mdash; Simple browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox that open up federal court data. If you use PACER, install RECAP to join this initiative. 
 
 - [CourtListener.com][cl] &ndash; Our fully-searchable and accessible archive of court data including growing repositories of opinions, oral arguments, judges, and federal filings.
 
 - Fact sheets for [PACER][p-fs] and the [FJC Integrated Database][fjc-fs] so that the public can better understand these services.
 
 - An extremely detailed [database of reporters][rdb].
 
 - A collection of [hundreds of pictures of federal and state judges][pic-db].
 
 - A [repository of judicial seals][seal-db].
 
 - [Data services and consulting][serv].
 
All together, these projects provide valuable tools and analysis for those that want to access, study, or improve the American legal system.

We do all of this work on [a shoestring budget][budget] that is supported by a blend of [services][serv], [donations][donate], and [sponsorships][spon].  We occasionally seek and get grants, but we usually lack the resources they require for submission unless grant officers come to us. 

All of our work is open source, creating a rich culture of [staff][who] and volunteers.
