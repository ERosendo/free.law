### Why Support Free Law Project?

<p class="lead">Since 2010 we have worked to make high quality open legal data available and to reform and enhance the legal ecosystem.</p> 
 
There are too many barriers to fair and equal access to justice. Using advocacy, data, and technology we work to lower these barriers. We serve hundreds of thousands of people every year while building some of the biggest open archives of legal data on the planet.

Help us build a more accountable, transparent, open, and competitive justice system.
