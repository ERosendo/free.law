Summary: Legal Data Services and Consulting from Free Law Project, a 501(c)(3)
             nonprofit.


<p class="lead">Can't find what you need? Too hard to process the data yourself? Free Law Project provides customized research and reports for modest fees.</p>

We have millions of opinions from hundreds of jurisdictions in our database. We have tens of thousands of oral arguments. We have information about nearly every reporter written. This data is all available via our <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/">APIs</a>, but making sense of it can be very time consuming and expensive.

To fill this need, we have begun offering data services. Our work is usually billed hourly, but we are available for project-based billing as well. We charge **$115/hour** with a one hour minimum. Billing is rounded up to the nearest half hour. Non-profit discounts are available for verified 501(c)(3) organizations.


### Example Projects

The following are three simple projects that we have completed:

 - **One Hour**: Please generate a CSV of all the Supreme Court citations in your collection.

 - **Two Hours**: Please create a zip file of all Oral Argument audio files in your system.

 - **Three Hours**: Please give me a histogram of the usage of exclamation points in Supreme Court opinions.


### Joint Projects

In addition to data requests, we are also open to working on projects with a common goal. If you have projects that might require generating new forms of metadata or that might require significant effort on our behalf, please [get in touch][c] with your idea so we can discuss it further. If the project is one that we also have on our roadmap, we can sometimes work together towards a common goal.


### Getting Started

Getting started is very easy. Just [send us a brief email][c] with what you need. If it's something complicated, we'll arrange a call to talk. If not, we can often just start the work immediately. Many projects can be completed the same day they are requested.
