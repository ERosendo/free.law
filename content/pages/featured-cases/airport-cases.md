On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed an [Executive Order titled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"][pdf]. The next day, civil rights and immigration lawyers began filing legal challenges throughout the country. As the dockets from these cases become available in Free Law Project's [RECAP Archive][recap], we are linking them on this page.

If you would like to add a docket link or suggest another update to this page, please [contact us][c] or [submit a Pull Request on GitHub][pr].

There appear to be many more airport cases than we have listed. Here are some suggestions for finding them in our RECAP Archive:

- [This search][moar] finds all cases with "Trump" in a party name that were filed on or after January 28, 2017.
- [This search][moar2] finds all cases coded with Nature of Suit code 463 (Habeas Corpus - Alien Detainee) filed on or after January 28, 2017.

These searches are imperfect and underinclusive, but they're a start toward finding more cases.
