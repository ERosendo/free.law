Title: Who is John Fuenchem and Why is he Contacting Me About Free Law Project and/or RECAP?
Slug: who-is-john-fuenchem


"John Fuenchem" is an alias adopted by a RECAP user who is frustrated with the way Free Law Project is run, and in particular with some [changes to the way the RECAP system works][changes]. These changes were announced in November 2017, and he has been waging an email and social media campaign on this topic since that time. We are sorry that he is contacting you today and absorbing your time. He has absorbed a lot of our time too, and this page serves to document who he is (as much as we know), and what he has done and continues to do.

Since November 2017, when we [released a new and vastly improved version of RECAP][changes], "Fuenchem" has been contacting numerous journalists and individuals. His typical approach is to identify somebody that supports Free Law Project publicly, either on Twitter or elsewhere, and to send that person emails listing his grievances and encouraging that person to spread the word. 

In addition to contacting our supporters, he has also approached numerous journalists and individuals that are important in the legal world and encouraged them write articles or otherwise spread the word. Of the many journalists that "Fuenchem" has contacted, only one has chosen to write an article, despite many of them discussing the topic with our executive director, Michael Lissner. 

The one article that was written explains the changes that were made to RECAP in detail, and has several quotes from our executive director and others explaining the situation. It serves as a good place to get some background:

We had hoped that with that article published, "Fuenchem" would stop his crusade, but unfortunately he continued sending his emails to numerous people. Many of those people forwarded the emails to our executive director, who began keeping a log of the emails on Twitter:

"Fuenchem" has sent at least dozens of these emails, but he will not tell us precisely how many. 

At the same time that he was writing these emails, "Fuenchem" was also finding blog posts about Free Law Project or RECAP and posting his grievances as comments.

After many months of these ongoing and voluminous communications, our executive director decided to attempt to address "Fuenchem's" grievances head on by writing him an email. Perhaps, we thought, directly addressing his concerns would end the months-long crusade to discredit Free Law Project. After emailing with him for many days and answering dozens of his questions, our executive director had written more than 12,000 words in reply. 

Rather than be satisfied by these responses, "Fuenchem" converted them into a Q&A he posted on a blog he created for that purpose. This effectively doxed private emails from our executive director while putting them in a different context than they were intended. The "Q&A" can be found on the webpage created by "Fuenchem," here:

And archived, here:

When "Fuenchem" shared a draft of his "Q&A" with our executive director in July 2018, our executive director firmly requested that it not be published. It took his emails out of context (the emails were not written to be directly part of a Q&A), and the Q&A omitted critical details, such as those listed above regarding the email and social media campaign that "Fuenchem" had been waging over the previous six months.

In recent days, "Fuenchem" has concluded that because our executive director won't share detailed financial and donor records with him, that must mean there's a secret that's being hidden and a scandal to be uncovered. He continues asking questions and seems dead set on continuing to contact people. His latest email concludes with a clear threat to contact the IRS and additional journalists: 

> If you continue refusing to answer these questions when I ask them, maybe you'll be more forthcoming with various journalists or the IRS. These questions are not going away and neither am I.

So at this point, we have tried ignoring him for around six months, tried addressing his grievances directly, and we have dealt with the questions he stirred up with journalists and RECAP users. 

As a very small organization we have limited resources for public outreach and, having learned that he is never satisfied with our answers and seems only to want to find conspiracy and scandal where there is none, we have concluded that we will no longer waste our limited resources on him. He has consumed a lot of our time and we again apologize if he has absorbed yours. We hope that you will just ignore his emails. We wish we had. 

If you have lingering questions, or if he has contacted you, [please feel free to send us an email][c].


## Conclusions

1. "Fuenchem" will not reveal who he is. He claims he is using the alias to protect himself, but he has been using it since at least 2015 according to [a somewhat rude support request he sent us][rude-email], which concludes:
 
    > Overall, I find the browser extension to be frustrating and difficult to use. I have wasted many billable pages trying to figure out why documents weren't uploading. Please do something to fix these problems.
    
    "Fuenchem" also refuses to speak to our executive director on the phone to discuss his grievances.

1. "Fuenchem" has contacted dozens of people over a period of six months. He won't say how many. Only one of those people has taken him up on his offer to write an article about the topic. The result was [a well-researched piece][ambrogi] explaining the changes and including supportive statements from leaders in the field.

1. Despite protracted and strenuous attempts, "Fuenchem's" grievances are not satisfied. It seems they never will be.

1. It's entirely unclear why Fuenchem has decided to wage this crusade against Free Law Project and RECAP.

1. "Fuenchem" has absorbed an incredible amount of people's time.
