## Successes This Year

2017 was easily our most successful year. We launched numerous big projects, including [a project to gather every free judicial opinion in PACER][opinions] and [a total revamp of the RECAP Extensions and APIs][recap]. CourtListener had more than three million visits, served more than 14 million API requests, and our traffic continues to grow. With support from our RECAP users, we were also able to host some of the most important legal cases during the year, including the cases coming out of [the Mueller investigation][m], [the Muslim ban][muslim], and [Waymo v. Uber][wvu].[^1]
 
We also had an active year for political advocacy, including [signing an amicus brief][ga] in support of open laws in Georgia, and [filing an expert declaration][dec] explaining the marginal costs of running PACER. Next year we already have more in the works.

We also had numerous small successes:

 - CourtListener hit several milestones â€” for example, it now [has more than a million minutes][mill] of oral argument recordings and more than [forty million pages of PACER documents][40].
 
 - Our data consulting services completed numerous projects in support of our mission including ones with [Empirical SCOTUS][es] and [Georgia State University][gsu].
 
 - We [created a new webpage with lots of information about PACER][pd], and were [honored with a Le Hackie award][lh] for our series of blog posts on the topic.
 
 - We [responsibly disclosed a major vulnerability in the PACER system][vuln] so that lawyers across the country could use PACER safely.

All of this work has enhanced the state of legal technology and legal data and has created a more safe, fair, and innovative justice system.
