## Successes This Year

2018 was truly an incredible year for Free Law Project with numerous small and large successes. In general, our work had four themes:

1. Expanding [the ways we get PACER documents and dockets][coverage] beyond just the RECAP extensions.
 
1. Enhancing and improving the [RECAP Archive itself][ra] so you can better search, view, and leverage it.

1. Working hard on outreach to continue sharing PACER data with the public and the broader legal ecosystem.

1. Ramping up our advocacy work so that we can fix things with policy, not code. 

These themes led to some big successes including [a new and powerful system for PACER docket alerts][alerts] and a huge expansion of [our PACER sources][coverage]. In 2018, the new sources of PACER data added more than **twenty million pages of PACER PDFs** from more than 500,000 documents (read on for details). Through another of our initiatives this year, all of this is uploaded to the Internet Archive for permanent preservation and dissemination.

On the advocacy side:
 
  - We helped craft [a great bill in Congress][gt] that we hope will make PACER free. 
  
  - We publicly [pushed back against invalid GDPR requests][gdpr] that sought to remove legal documents from the Internet.
  
  - We got several courts to add RSS to their PACER installations, so that all PACER alerting tools across the Internet could use them. 
  
  - And we played a role in the 10th Circuit finally adding oral argument recordings to their website. This was the last circuit court to do so after years of advocacy from us and others.
  
There's always more advocacy to do, and we hope to do more of it in 2019.

Finally, 2018 was a great year for recognition:
 
 - We were able to contribute our research to [a major article in the New Yorker][nyer] about the Waymo v. Uber case.
  
 - We were cited in articles and tweets by The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow and others.
  
 - We were added to the [Library of Congress's Guide to the Law Online][loc] as well as numerous academic research guides.

 - We received two mentions on the American Bar Association's [list of best web tools for 2018][aba] — Once for CourtListener and again for RECAP.
