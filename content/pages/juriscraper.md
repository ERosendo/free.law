Juriscraper is a scraper library started several years ago that gathers judicial opinions, PACER content, and oral arguments in the American court system. It is currently able to scrape:

- Opinions from all major appellate Federal courts
- Opinions from all state courts of last resort (typically their "Supreme Court")
- Oral arguments from all appellate federal courts that offer them
- A variety of content from PACER

Juriscraper is part of a two-part system. The second part is your code, which calls Juriscraper.

We created Juriscraper to create a unified scraper framework that any organization can use to get the latest content from the hundreds of courts in the US.
