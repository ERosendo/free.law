Juriscraper is a scraper library started several years ago that gathers
judicial opinions and oral arguments in the American court system. It is
currently able to scrape:

-   opinions from all major appellate Federal courts
-   opinions from all state courts of last resort (typically their
    "Supreme Court")
-   oral arguments from all appellate federal courts that offer them

Juriscraper is part of a two-part system. The second part is your code,
which calls Juriscraper.

We created Juriscraper to create a unified scraper framework that any
organization can use to get the latest content from the hundreds of
courts in the US.
