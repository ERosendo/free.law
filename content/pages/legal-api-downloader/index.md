<p class="lead">Our Legal API Downloader is a tool for Apple computers or Docker that helps gather data from Harvard's Caselaw Access Project.</p>

Simply install either our MacOS App or run our docker image. Unfortunately, if you have a Windows computer, we don't have a way you can help yet (get in touch if you're interested in helping).
