Title: Legal API Downloader -- Running the Mac Program
Slug: legal-api-downloader/apple/


<p class="lead">These instructions show you how to run our MacOS app to gather and share cases from Harvard's Caselaw Access Project.</p>

By using this software, you will use your credentials to gather legal cases from the Harvard Caselaw Access Project. The items that you gather will then be shared with us. Once shared with us, we upload them to the Internet Archive, a permanent digital public library.

Thank you for your interest in joining this effort. When this is complete we will have unlocked centuries of important legal data. Finally, the law will be freely accessible to everybody who needs it.


**Note:** By providing these instructions and this software, we neither encourage nor endorse the use of their software, your API, or any related software. Using our docker image is *your* choice, and before making any choice we encourage *you* to evaluate any necessary terms, laws, conditions, or other rules or regulations that may apply.
