Title: RECAP Project -- Turning PACER Around
Slug: recap

<p class="lead">RECAP is a free extension for Firefox and Chrome that improves the experience of using PACER, the electronic public access system for the U.S. Federal District and Bankruptcy Courts.</p>

RECAP is a free extension that is very simple to use and has no configuration. It:

 - Helps you give back by contributing to a public archive.
 - Saves you money by showing you when free documents are available in the archive.
 - Keeps you organized by providing better file names to the files you download on PACER.

Thousands of people have used RECAP, and together we have created an archive with millions of documents.

To use RECAP, simply install it and then use PACER as you normally would. It's that simple.

RECAP is a joint project of the <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/">Center for Information Technology Policy</a> at Princeton University and <a href="/">Free Law Project</a>. It is one of several projects that harness the power of the web to increase government transparency.</p>

RECAP is led by Free Law Project co-founders [Brian Carver](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/briancarver) and [Michael Lissner](http://michaeljaylissner.com/). CITP Director [Ed Felten](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/) also provides guidance. RECAP was created by Harlan Yu, Steve Schultze, and Timothy B. Lee, based on the principles described in [Government Data and the Invisible Hand](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1138083).
