Title: RECAP Project -- Turning PACER Around
Slug: recap

<p class="lead">RECAP is an <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/">online archive</a> and free extension for Firefox and Chrome that improves the experience of using PACER, the electronic public access system for the U.S. Federal District and Bankruptcy Courts.</p>

The online archive contains millions of searchable PACER documents and can be used to do deep research within a case, a topic, or a jurisdiction.

The RECAP extensions are very simple to use and have no configuration. They:

 - Help you give back by contributing to a public archive.
 - Save you money by showing you when free documents are available in the archive.
 - Keep you organized by providing better file names to the files you download on PACER.

Thousands of people have used RECAP, and together we have created <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/">an archive with millions of documents</a>.

To use RECAP, simply install it and then use PACER as you normally would. It's that simple.

RECAP is a joint project of the <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/">Center for Information Technology Policy</a> at Princeton University and <a href="/">Free Law Project</a>. It is one of several projects that harness the power of the web to increase government transparency.</p>

RECAP is led by Free Law Project co-founders [Brian Carver](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/briancarver) and [Michael Lissner](http://michaeljaylissner.com/). CITP Director [Ed Felten](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/) also provides guidance. RECAP was created by Harlan Yu, Steve Schultze, and Timothy B. Lee, based on the principles described in [Government Data and the Invisible Hand](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1138083).
