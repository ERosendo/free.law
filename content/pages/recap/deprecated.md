The version of RECAP that you are using was deprecated on 13 November 2017 when we released a new version of the extension for both Firefox and Chrome. A detailed explanation of the changes [can be found on our blog from that date][new-recap].

We continued supporting this version of the extension until 1 January 2018, when we disabled it on our servers.
