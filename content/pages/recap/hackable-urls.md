Title: Hacking RECAP Links to Find the Docket for a PDF
Slug: recap/hacking-recap-links/

If you have a link to a PDF in the RECAP Archive, you can tweak it to be taken to the docket for that PDF. 

For example, this link:

> [https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.308136.1.0.pdf][pdf]

Leads to the initial complaint in [Waymo v. Uber][way]. 

To find the docket itself, simply remove everything after the PACER case ID, which is `308136` in this case. That will make a link like:

> [https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.308136][r]
    
This link will take you to the docket for Waymo v. Uber.
