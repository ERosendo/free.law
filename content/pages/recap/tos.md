## General Description of RECAP

RECAP is a project of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University ("CITP").

The RECAP Extension is a free extension for Firefox that improves the experience of using PACER, the electronic public access system for the U.S. Federal District and Bankruptcy Courts. In the course of using the Extension, you upload public records downloaded from PACER to the Internet Archive ("IA").

The IA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit tasked with building an Internet library with permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in a digital format. The IA will serve as the ultimate repository of the public records uploaded by RECAP users. When the Extension is active, all such records are uploaded in an automated fashion. The Extension then notifies RECAP users when a public record searched for on PACER is publicly-available for free download through the Extension, from the IA repository. The IA is not directly affiliated with RECAP; users of the RECAP Materials should review IA's own Terms of Use, which are available at http://www.archive.org/about/terms.php.
