Title: RECAP Project -- What People are Saying
Slug: recap/quotes/

> If you are a PACER user, I strongly encourage you to download
> RECAP.

**--- Todd Ito [of the *Chicago Association of Law Libraries*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/nov/11/recap-us-courtrooms)**

> Since \[RECAP\] launched in August, legal circles have been buzzing
> with support for the idea.

**--- Bobbie Johnson [in the *Guardian*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/nov/11/recap-us-courtrooms)**

> A sleek little add-on to the popular Firefox Internet browser" with
> a stylish and subversive touch.

**--- Katherine Mangu-Ward [in the *Wall Street Journal*](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203550604574361032197709414.html)**

> A sort of digital Kumbaya.

**--- Michael Hiltzik [in the *Los Angeles Times*](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik28-2009sep28,0,3104293.column)**

> Citizens deserve open and easy access to all public court documents.
> Until public access becomes a matter of policy rather than blocked by
> PACER's artificial pay wall, independent efforts like RECAP continue
> to fill a critical gap in our ability to foster a more participatory
> and engaged democracy.

**--- Ari Schwartz, [Center for Democracy and Technology](http://cdt.org/)**

> RECAP makes critical legal information more available at lower cost -
> a private innovation on public data that will help deliver on a
> cherished promise: government of the people, by the people, and for
> the people.

**--- Jim Harper, [Cato Institute](http://www.cato.org/) and [WashingtonWatch.com](http://www.washingtonwatch.com/)**

> "Government records, including court records, belong to the public. By
> lowering the barriers that have made it difficult for citizens and
> non-profit investigative Centers to access these records, RECAP is
> making a valuable contribution to greater transparency and
> accountability, and therefore to Democracy."

**--- Bill Buzenberg, Executive Director of the [Center for Public Integrity](http://www.publicintegrity.org/)**

> "Where the people are sovereign, government must always be accountable
> to citizens - and one important way to insure that remains so is by
> making government records available to the public. RECAP promises to
> make court
> records accessible to the public, helping to further guarantee the
> sovereignty of the people over our trusted servants in the
> government."

**--- Christopher Farrell, Director of Investigations & Research, [Judicial Watch](http://www.judicialwatch.org/)**

> As part of a trend toward opening access to American common law,
> RECAP’s place at the heart or the periphery of the movement remains to
> be seen. Like any crowdsourcing application, RECAP’s usefulness
> increases as more people use it. Yet PACER’s prime users are large,
> bill-paying law firms, which tend to be wary about adopting new
> technology and have little incentive to contribute documents they paid
> for to a free database.
>
> “Success” for RECAP may not be mainstream adoption, however. Merely by
> creating the working plugin and calling attention to the problem of
> restricted access to court documents, CITP has advanced the cause of
> reforming and opening up access to PACER. That alone is “Turning PACER
> around.”
