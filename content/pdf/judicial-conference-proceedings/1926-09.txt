                r There were preeent under the call Circuit Judge Bingham, of the first circuit i
                 Circuit Judge Hough, of the second circuit; Circuit Judge Woolley, of the third
                 circuit; Circuit Judge Waddill, of the (ou'rth circuit; Circuit Judge Walker, of the

                 of the seventh circuit; Circuit Judge Sanborn, of the eighth circuit; Circuit Judge
                 Gilbert, of the ninth circuit.
                    Sessions continued for five days. Adjournment took p~ce on Friday, October
                 1,1926.
                    The conference had the benefit of consultation with the Attorney General and
                 Assistant Attorneys General Donoyan and Marshall, Chairman Korner, and
                 Mr. Littleton or the BQ8rd of United States Tax Appeals.
               . Each senior circuit judge presented the reports made to him by the district
                 judges within his circuit &8 to the statistics of the civil and criminal business in
                 the district courts and the circuit courts of appeals of his circuit, with a full and
                 informal statement by him &8 to the real and actual conditions and the possibility
                 of betterment.
                    The conrerence is gratified at finding that substantial progress had been made
                 during the past year in reducing the delays and congestion of business which
                 recently added judgeships had been created to remove.
                    The records of the Department of Justice presented by the Attorney General
                'showed the rollowing table ror the years 1923, 1924, 1925, and 1926, for the total
                judicial business in the trial courts of the t"nited States down to the close
                 of business as of June 30 of the last year:

                    This shows an increase in three ~'ears of something more than 6,000 cases, or
               . of 50 per cent on the civil docket in which the lJnited States is II. party. It
                 shows a reduction on the criminal docket in the same period of from 67,173 cases
                 in 1923 to 38,861 cases in 1926, a reduction of oyer 28,312 cases, more than 42
                 per cent, As to thc criminal cases, the evidence before the conference, the
                 statistical reports from the Department of Justice, the reports of the district
                 judges, and the knowlerlge of the members of tbe conference lead to the con­
                 clusion that this result has been due to the increase in the Humber of judges, to
                 the policy of the DeI)artment of j'u!ltice in diRcollraging the prosecution of insig­
                 nificant and unimportn.nt alleged "iolations of thc law, and to the acth'ity of
                 courts and district attorneys in seeking to remo\'e from the dockct the dead
                 cases that can not be tried for lack of e"'dence.
                    It sho\\'s a decrease of 4~ per ccnt 011 thc ch'i1 dockct in cases in "'hieh the

    these reports more satisfactory. One is to continue the riddiD« of the dockets
    of dead cases, and the conference has deemed it ~e to take steps to further
    this much to be desired result by the following recommendations:
       .. The suggestion heretofore made in respect of long-pending cases Is repeated
    and strenuously urged, i. e., that • In any ease which might have been brought to
    trial, in which no action has been taken by the parties for one year, it shall be
    the duty of the clerk to mail notice thereol to counsel of record and to the parties
    thereto, if their post-office addresses are known, 30 days before the opening of
    the term of court following the 1st of January in each year. If such notiee has
    been given, and no action has peen taken in the case in the meantime, an order
    of dismissal shall be entered as of course at the opening of such term of court.'
       "Criminal cases should be forced to trial within what the court deems a
    reasonable time. To that end indictments and informations should be placed
    by the clerk on the trial docket calendar or list at the term following issue joined,
    if trial can not be justly held at the term wherein plea is entered. Criminal
    cases are subject to the same control by the court as are civil cases, and indict­
    ments and informations should be ordered for trial, and tried or dismissed for
    delay substantially as has been above recommended in resped; of pending causes
    generally."           .
       Everyone who has attempted to deal "ith the question of delays in the admin­
    istration of justice has found his path obstructed by a mass of unintelligible
    statistics in respect to the exact condition of the dockets and the real businesS
    of the courts.
       The statistics as they are now rendered need investigation and analysis to
    distinguish between real cases which should be tried, and those which merely
    lumber the docket and should be dismissed.
       The conference has been advised that the Court of Appeals of New York has
    created a committee, of which Judge Pound of that court Is chairman, to devi.se
    a plan for judicial statistics that shall be useful, and the need. for change and
    reform in this respect is pressing.
       Ncr single agency to induce Congress and State legislatures to the enactment of
    measures to improve the administration of the criminal law could be more
    effective than the practical truth in respect to the condition of the courts In the
    prosecution of crime, and nothing would more stimulate a demand for greater
    speed in the disposition of the ci vil cases in behalf of the litigating public than the
    truth as to the delays and congestion in the civil docket.
       The conference has appointed a committee of two of Its members, Judge Hough
    and Judge Denison, to devise a plan of reports for the dlstrld; judges that shaD
    bring to it at its next meeting more accurate information upon tbls head. If the
    result of what the conference Is able to do in this matter i.e encouraging, it may
    well lead to a recommendation for the establishment, perhaps under the auspices
    of the conference, of a small bureau of judicial statistics engaged during the
    whole year in ascertaining the exact facts.
       The tabular statement given above discloses the conditiona in the district
    courts. The circuit courts of appeals have continued their admirable reeord and
    are substantially abreast of their dockets. A case in one of them Is argued and
    disposed of in less than the year in which it le begun in that court. 10 order to
    secure this, however, the judges of those courts have all the work they can do.
       While headway is being made against the piling up of arrean, more judges are
    needed in certain parts of the country, not only to avoid further congestion but to
    catch up with the docket 80 that cases can be tried within a reaaonable time. We
    therefore urgently recommend additional judges be provided in the following
(   circuits and districts. As we recommended last year, we recommend again thia
    ycar that a new circuit judge be provided in the second circuit. That circuit h..
~~.:   ....   ·20·.. now.four circuit judges.
              .                                 It has the largest docket of any of the circuits in t.he 

                   United States. It is in the great. metropolis of the country, in the city of New 

                   York, and it. is of the highest. importance that. no arrears should occur,in that. 

                   court. A fifth judge ·would certainly avoid this and would avoid what too 

                   frequently happens in the Federal courts, the breaking down of judges by 

                   overwork. 

                      We recommend also, as we have aire&d,· done a district judge for the eastern
                   district of Pennsylvania and a district j~dge f~r the northern district of Cali­
                   fornia. These judges are recommended, lIot to add new judges to the judicial
                   force, but only to take the places of judges who have died and in respcct to whose
                   successors the act of 1922 provided that no vacancy occurring could be filled
                   unless Congress should by additional legislation so direct.        .
                      One of these judgeships is in the important city of Philadelphia and the other
                   In the important city of San Francisco, and the vacancies made should be at
                   once fiUed to prevent II. faUing behind in the district courts there held.
                      We also recommend that in southern Iowa special provision should be made
                   for the appointment of an additional judge, not to become a permanent addition
                   to the judicial force in that district, but only to 8.'!Sist the judge now in office,
                   who is disabled by bad health from doing his full work.
                      We renew our recommendation of last year t.hat three new district judges be
                   provided for in the southern district of Xe\\' York. In that district the results
                   for the year ending June 30 are as (ollows:

                        There are six judges in this district and all have been constantly on duty.
                    They have reeeh'cd assistance from thc circuit judges of the circuit to the extent
                    of i2 days, (rom other district judges of the circuit, 47 days, and from 12 or
                    more district judges (rom other circuits, 378 days.
                      . The very large increase in the popUlation o( Brooklyn and thc eastern distri('t
                   of Xew York makes II. new district judge there impera.tive. The work in that
                   district has ra.p1dly fallen behind during the pa.~t year. The civil Ruits betwcen
                    private persons have increased in the year [ronl :'),965 to 7,298. The civil fluits in
                   which the United Statcs is a party hAV<' increased from 1,281 to 1,856 and the
                    criminal (,Mes [rom 3,463 to 3,748.
                    . We renew ollr recommendation of a IIC\\' district judge in the western district
                   ·of Xew York And one in· the district o( Connccticut. We also renew our recuUl-           (' .
                                                                                        2.1
mendation that a new district judge be provided in the district of Maryland.
We add to our recommendations previously made by one in favor of a new district
judge to be created·for the eastern district of Michigan, where the present judicial
force of two judges is wholly inadequate, and another in favor of a new judge to
be created in the western district of North Carolina. This State has two dis­
tricts and two district judges. The growth of the State in population and in
business is so remarkable that another judge is required,               .
    To sum up, therefore, we urge legislation needed to supply the places of judges
whose services have been lost by death or illness-thl'ef?; of them, We renew
ou,r recommendations made last year for the creation of six new district judges,
and we also recommend three more judges in districts who'se business, as reported
to us by our members, and by the statistics, demonstrates the need for them.
    The appropriations for the fiscal year 1926 provided a special fund of $100,000
for law books for judicial officers, the expenditure qf which was to be subject to
the approval of the judicial conference. Plans therefor were adopted at the con­
ference meeting in June, 1925, and were carried out during the fiscal year. The
 plan involved the union of the $100,000 and the regular appropriation of $65,000
to ca,rry it out, and required therefore the cooperation of the Attorney General
and his assistants, which was effectively given. Under the plan, all the pending
 requests were surveyed and divided into two classesi the primary need to supply
 existing deficiency to give each judge and district attorney the minimum essell~
 tial library, and the secondary need for fUrther desirable books' and for some
 working books at additional places of holding court in each district. By the
 purchase made (including orders placed but not filled on June 30, 19~6), all the
 primary' need WIlS met, and some $17 )000 expended upon the most ~rgent of the
 secondary class. The result is that for the first time in many years the district
 judges find that they are fairly well supplied with their necessary tools, and the
 circuit courts of appeals have 'reasonably satisfactory libraries, or will have with
 the aid of further special items of legislation now in force. We have no doubt
 that the efficiency of the Courts has been substantially increased by the aid
 which this Congressional app'ropriation has given.
    For July 1926 to July 1927, the regular appropriation is $65,000, to be disbursed
 by the AttorneY General. So far as we can judge,- a slightly increased annual
 appropriation should be sufficient for the normal continuing needs for the dis­
 trict courts and circuit courts of appeals. An increase of $10,000 is needed for
 three reasons; (a) For books for additional courts about to be createdj (b) for
 new sets of books at new places of holding court in existing districtsi (c) for the
 cost of the new compilation of the United States Statutes soon to be published
 and circulated. It is extensively annotated and is quite expensive' and will be
 required in large numbers. tVe recommend that the regular annual appro'pria­
 tion be made .$75,000, and believe that this will be fairly ample for ~all essential
 uses for the immediate futUre.
    The chairman of the Board of United States Tax Appeals has requested that
 the conference recommend to the nine circuit courts of appeals·the adoption of a
 uniform body of rules governing the review provided for by statute in the circuit
  courts of appeals of decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals. The conference haa
  examined the law and has conferred with the chairman and another member of
  the board. It believes that such uniformity ought to be had, but it deems it its
  duty to refrain from framing any rule that seems to declare any opinion in respect
  of the scope of the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of appeals in this behalf.
  The rules should be wholly procedural, and relate only to matters not covered by
