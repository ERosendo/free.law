                (REPORT OF THE .JUDICIAL CONFERENCE.. )

             RECOJIOIENDATION5 OF CONFEIlENCE OF SENIORCIRCUlT JUDGES

          The conference of senior circuit judges, presided over by the
       Chief Justice of the United States, was held in Washington beginning
       on September 26 and ending on September 28, 1928. The conference
       renews its recommendations of last year that three additional district
       judA't's be provided for the southern district of New York and one
       additional circuit judge for the second circuit. It also recommends
       two additional district judges for the eastern district of New
       York (instead of one additional judge as recolJ'I.mended last year)
       and one for the southern district of Florida, and one additional
      .circuit judge for the ninth circuit. In these reCommendations I
       concur. The full text of the report of the conference follows:

     It wUl be seen that there was an Increase In the clvU ba.s1ness ot the United 

 States In the year ot 2,359. and in the criminal eases there was a decrease ot 

 4.921. but an Increase In the same year ot private cl.vU cases ot 98L                       .
     The reports o( the dl~rict judges alltl uf the circuit Jddgcs show that the 

  removal ot dead cases goes on ttnd4.!f the ruit'S whlcb were suggested by 

  this body in previous reports. but that there Is a CO:usldcl'uble (ncrefl.se arising 

  from the prosperity, uod the normal growth of business In the' collntry, which 

  more than otrsetB tho reduction due to the puUC); or cutUng down dead cases. 

     Speaking g('neral1y. it wus clear to the coufer(>nce th~t the condttion of
 business in all the courts was satisfactory, nud shuwed that there were enough
 judges to do the business and that the business would nil be done. except thnt In
 the second circuit, the two districts which tlre the southern :md the cnstern
 districts ot New York. including New York nnd Brooklyn. nre in .n bopelcsn
 situation. and ctm not be iK>tter('d ttnlt~;::: at len~t thr'('(~ d!... trkt jud~ws are

    In addition to the Xew York dl:4rict judges. nnly Ollt.! JllOrc :;eems tq be

                 been assigned to the ninth circuit tor a number ot years. ThJs was Judge

                 his place by the creation ot another circuit judge tor that very large ninth .
                 <.'ircult seems clear to us,
                    The judges of the circuit courts ot appeals, many ot them, reside at·places far
                 trom the cities in wblch tbey h'old court, and after their sessions are obliged to
                 bring to their homes, tor the study ot eases and the writing ot opinIons. heavY
                 f'(-('ords and briefs. Tbe limitations Imposed by law and the postal regulations
                 are such that these documeuts. absolutely necessary to the dispPsitlon of business'
                 by the judge~, must be ("ut down to separate packages Dot exceeding 4 pouuds.
                 We .n..'<.'ommen(] that the law and the regulations be changed so as to permit
                 the sending of ne<:essary court records and books in one package trom one plac:e
                 to another free through the malls without limitation of weight.
                    The cir('ulatJoll of law books to all the> Federal judges under previous appro..
                 printlClns has been useful and satisfactory. We recommend that these shall
                 hermftel· includ(! the tleW Recompiled Digest of the Federal Reporter and the
                 new Digest of the Uuited Stat~ Supreme Court Reports, published by the
                 r.awyer~· Couperative Publtl-thing Co.      Such digests are of the utmost value
                 In fadtituting the work of the judges and of the members ot the. bar wbo can
                 ha\'e aC(~esH to them.
                    This ('Oufcrellt"e at its last meetIng adopted a resolution providing tor n law
                clerk for ea('h circuit judge at 11 salary not to exceed $3,000 a year. We desire to
                 renew this recommendation, be(:(tuse the necessity for such a provisi~m.impresses
                Jt:.;clf more upon the conference than it bas ever done before.
                    It Is satisfactory to report that with the exception of the sixth circuit, which
                hns been delayed in the disposition of business before it, there are no arrears
                and that the business in those courts is substantially up to date. The'reason tor ,
                the delay in the sixth circuit bas been the heavy business there and the two . ,~.
                                                                                                     <
                years' U1ness and subsequent death of Judge Donahue. With the ftlilng ot the
                vacancy and the addition of n fourth cIrcuit judge there, just provIded and
                nppointed, the :.;m<lll urrcnrs in tbat circuit wlll be promptly met. But It can '
                not be too (>mphntlcal1y stated that the only way by which arrears have been
                prevented in theJ:$e nine circuit courts of appeal has been continuous and hard
                Jabor. The opiuions of these courts. which' have high standing. are very
                important. and it is not a waste but a real belp to the public business to
                furnish law clerks: to the circuit judges to assist them in their labors ot'
                lu·epnrntlon.
                    The conference recommends to the senior circuit judges that in solIcltlng
                reports from the senior district judges of their respective circuits there be
                included therein the number of cases submitted to the district judges which
                have not been decided by the 1st of August of each year.
                    For the judicial conference.
