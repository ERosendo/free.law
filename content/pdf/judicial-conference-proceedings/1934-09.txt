               REPORT OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE. 

                             SEPTEMBER SESSION,      1934. 



           The Judicial Conference provided for in the Act of Con­
         gress of September 14, 1922 (U. S. Code, Title 28, sec. 218),
         convened on September 27, 1934. The following judges
         were present in response to the call of the Chief Justice:
            First Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge George H. Bingham.
            Second Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Martin T. Manton.
           Third Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Joseph Buffington.
           Fourth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge JohnJ. Parker.
           Fifth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Nathan P. Bryan.
           Sixth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Charles H. Moorman.
           Eighth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Kimbrough Stone.
           Ninth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Curtis D. Wilbur.
           Tenth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Robert E. Lewis.
           The Senior Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit, Judge
         Samuel Alschuler, was absent, and his place was taken by
         Circuit Judge Evan A. Evans.
           The Attorney General, the Solicitor General, and their
         aides were present at the opening of the Conference.
            State of the Dockets.-Nutnber of Cases Begutt, Disposed
         of, and Pending, in the Federal District Courts.-The At­
         torney General submitted to the Conference a report of the
         condition of the dockets of the Federal District Courts for
         the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934, as compared with the
         previous fiscal year. Each Circuit Judge also presented to
         the Conference a detailed report, by districts, of the work
         of the courts in his circuit.
            The report of the Attorney General, summarizing the an­
         nual reports received from district attorneys and clerks,
         l<howed the comparative number of cases in each of the three
.   (

                                     2
major classes commenced and terminated during the fiscal
years 1933 and 1934, as follows:
                                    Commenced                 Terminated.
                                    1933        1934         1933      1934

    Total ................ 135,128            70,111        138,598   90,091
  It thus appears that there was a large decrease in Gov­
ernment cases (civil and criminal) in the fiscal year 1934,
as compared with the previous year, a decrease due largely
to the repeal of the National Prohibition Act, effective in
December, 1933. Private litigation was of about equal
volume in the two years mentioned. The Attorney General
submitted the following comparative statement of pending
cases, as of June 30, 1933 and June 30, 1934:
    Pending cases-                               1933                  1934

    Total ..................................                 82,839   62,832
  This statement shows that considerable progress was
made in clearing the dockets of the district courts during
the past year. The total number of cases pending on June                       J



30, 1934, exclusive of bankruptcy petitions, was 24 per cent.
less than on June 30, 1933.
  Criminal Cases i11l General.-Notable progress was made
in reducing the congestion in the criminal dockets. On
June 30, 1933 there were pending in the district courts a
total of 20,907 criminal cases of all classes. The number
commenced during the fiscal year was 34,152, and the num­
ber terminated 'vas 45,577, leaving 9,478 pending on June
30,1934, as shown by the following table:
    Cl'iminal cases-                                          1933     1934

                                         3
   National Prohibition Act.-The reduction of the number
of cases on the criminal d-ockets is largely accounted for by
the repeal of the National Prohibition Act. The reports
compiled by the Attorney General show that only 6,676
criminal cases were instituted under this Act during the
fiscal year 1934, as compared with 57,553 cases during the
previous year. The number pending on June 30, 1934 was
only 1,280 and it is assumed that these will eventually be
dismissed. As to civil cases brought under the National
Prohibition Act, there were only 792 pending on June 30,
1934. The following tables give the summary of these
cases:

    In.ter,nal Revenue Cases.-The Attorney General states
  that since the repeal of the National Prohibition Act a large
  number of criminal cases are being prosecuted under the
. internal revenue laws. During the fiscal year 1933 only
  775 such cases were commenced and 674 terminated. Dur­
  ing the fiscal year 1934, 4,158 were commenced and 2,954
  terminated, and 1,786 were pending on June 30, 1934, as
  compared with 582 on June 30, 1933. The internal revenue
  laws have now taken the place of the National Prohibition
  Act as giving rise to the greatest number of criminal cases.
  The number of civil cases under the internal revenue laws
  decreased somewhat during the fiscal year. The Attorney
   General submitted the following tables:
    Internal ,'evenue-criminal-                                  1933     1934

          War Risk Insurance Litigation.-It appears from the
       statement of the Attorney General that of the total number
       of 17,303 civil cases to which the United States was a party,
       pending on June 30, 1934, 8,220 (or 47.5 per cent.) were
       suits against the Government under the Veterans' Insur­
       ance Acts. This is a reduction of 2,377 cases as compared
       with June 30, 1933, as shown by the following table:
           Wal' Risk Insltrance-                                      1933    1934

       Pending close of year ......................                  10,597    8,220
         Bankruptcy Petitions.-The Attorney General reports
       that complete statistics as to bankruptcy cases are not yet
       available, but that the records show that the number of
       cases pending on June 30, 1934 was 63,352, as compared
       with 68,195 on June 30, 1933, a reduction of 4,843 cases dur-                     t;:
                                                                                         "-'
       ing the year.
         The general conclusion to be dra,vn from the data pre­
       sented by the Attorney General is that while the repeal of
       the National Prohibition Act has caused a large reduction
       in the number of cases, the result of the increase in internal
       revenue cases, and of the institution of proceedings under
       legislation recently enacted, will prevent any substantial
       diminution in the actual work of the federal courts. It
       must be remembered that a large proportion of cases under
       the National Prohibition Act were terminated on pleas of
       guilty.
         Circuit Courts of Appeals.-These courts continue to
       keep up with their work in a satisfactory manner. Since
       the last session of the Judicial Conference, the Supreme
       Court has promulgated (May 7, 1934) rules of practice and
       procedure, after plea of guilty, verdict or finding of guilt,
       in criminal cases brought in the district courts of the
                                                                             87

          United States and in the Supreme Court of the District of
          Columbia. This action was taken under the Act of Con­
         gress of February 24, 1933, c. 119 (U. S. Code, Title 28, sec.
          723 (a) ), as amended by the Act of March 8, 1934. It is
         believed that under these rules unnecessary delays in the
         prosecution of criminal appeals will be avoided.
            District Courts.-In order to give a clearer view of the
          actual state of the work of the district courts, with respect
          to delays caused by an undue congestion of civil dockets,
         the Attorney General has compiled for the Judicial Con­
         ference a table showing the time required to reach the trial
          of civil cases after joinder of issue in the several courts.
            It is gratifying to note that it appears from this tabula­
         tion that, out of 84 federal districts in continental United
         States (exclusive of Alaska and the District of Columbia)
         in 31 districts "all ready cases are tried at term follow­
         ing joinder of issue". This is also true in certain divisions
         of 6 other districts, as to all civil cases, and in all divisions
         in 3 other districts, as to some classes of cases. Further,
         in 13 other districts, and in certain divisions of 3 'Other
         districts, as to all classes of cases, and in 6 districts as to
         some classes of cases, the average interval between joinder
         'Of issue and trial is reported tQ be not over 6 months. It
         is apparent that any general criticism of the work of the
         district cQurts, with respect tQ delays in reaching cases
         for trial, is wholly unjustified. Undue congestion and de­
         lays characterize, not the district CQurts as a whole, but
         only certain districts and because of exceptional circum­
         stances.
            The most serious congestion and delays are found in the
         Southern District of New York and in the Southern Dis­
         trict of California, and this condition is caused by the
         failure to provide a sufficient number of judges. Thus, the
         Attorney General reports that in the SQuthern District of
         New York, the average interval between jQinder of issue
         and trial in civil jury cases is 17 mQnths, in suits in equity,
         16 months, and in admiralty causes, 33 months. In the
         Southern District of California, the AttQrney General finds
         that this average interval, for all classes of civil cases, is
         from 18 to 24 months.

                Provisio:n for Additional District Judgeships.-The Judi­
              cial Conference earnestly urges, in accordance with its pre­
              vious recommendations, that this situation in New York
              and California should be promptly relieved by providing
              for the necessary number of judges to dispose of the busi­
              ness of these highly congested districts. Provision for the
              prompt and efficient administration of justice is a primary
              concern. It is of no avail to multiply laws if the machin­
              ery of enforcement is inadequate. All possible efforts have
              been made to give relief to these districts by assignments
              of judges from other districts. But, in justice to the de­
              mands of administration in other parts of the country, as­
              signments of this sort cannot be made so as to give the
              relief that is imperatively needed. Despite all the assign­
              ments that have been found to be practicable, and notwith­
              standing the unremitting endeavors of judges to dispose of
              the cases on their dockets, the delays above stated exist,
              causing a serious impairment of the administration of
              justice.
                The Conference accordingly renews its recommendation
              that the following additional district judges should be pro­
              vided:
                      2 additional district judges for the Southern Dis­
                        trict of N'ew York;
                      2 additional district judges for the Southern Dis­
                        trict of California.
                 In 'view of existing economic conditions, the Conference
              refrains at this time from pressing recommendations
              which it has previously made for other additional judge­
              ships, but without prejudice to their later renewal.
                Removal of Restrictions upon Appointment of Successors
              in Existing Judgeships.-Apart from provision for addi­
              tional judges, the Conference has heretofore directed at­
              tention to the need of removing restrictions upon the filling
              of vacancies in certain existing judgeships. The Confer­
              ence has carefully considered the desirability of the removal
              of these restrictions so that successors can be appointed in
              the cases in which vacancies occur, where experience has
              shown the necessity of having a permanent, instead of a         e'
                                                                              ~.

                                                                           I

       the following judgeships should be made permanent by re­
       moving the existing limitation upon the appointment of
       successors:
               2 in the District of Massachusetts;
               2 in the Southern District of New York;
               1 in the Eastern District of New York;
               1 in the Western District of Pennsylvania;
               1 in the Eastern District of Mi0higan;
               1 in the Eastern District of Missouri;
               1 in the Western District of Missouri;
               1 in the N,Qrthern District of Ohio;
               1 in the Southern District of California;
               1 in the District of Minnesota.
          As stated by the Conference in its report of last year,
       the importance of making appropriate provision for. the
       filling of such vacancies, before the vacancies actually
       arise, is shown by the situation in the Eastern District of
       Michigan, one of the judgeships above mentioned. That
       judgeship was held by Judge Simons, and on his appoint­
{( 	   ment as circuit judge there was no provision for filling the
       vacancy in the district court in the Eastern District of Mich­
       igan. Another illustration is found in the inability, under
       the existing statute, to fill the vacancy in the Southern Dis­
       trict of New York which arose on the resignation of Judge
       Winslow (since deceased).
          Places of Holding Terms of the Circuit Court of Appeals
       for the Fifth Circuit.-The Conference has heretofore
       recommended that sessions of the Circuit Court of Appeals
       for the Fifth Circuit should be held only at New Orleans,
       Louisiana, and the Conference deems the matter worthy of
       serious consideration by the Congress.
          Recommendations of Legislation.-The Conference re­
       news its expression of approval of proposed legislation
       as follows:
           Proposed Bill :-To relieve United States district judges
       of the duty of certifying to the expense accounts of United
       States attorneys and their assistants.

                                    8
       Proposed Bill :-To amend existing law so as to abolish
     the requirement of a certificate by United States district
     judges as to the necessity for the appointment of assistant
                                                                         ('.
     United States attorneys.
       Rules in Actions at Law.-The Act of Congress, ap­
     proved June 19, 1934, gives the Supreme Court authority
     to prescribe rules for the district courts of the United
     States, and for the courts of the District of Columbia,
     to govern practice and procedure in civil actions at law.
     The Act provides:
           That the Supreme Court of the United States shall have the
        power to prescribe, by general rules, for the district courts
        of the United States and for the courts of the District of Co­
        lumbia, the forms of process, writs, pleadings, and motions,
        and the practice and procedure in civil actions at la\v. Said
        rules shall neither abridge, enlarge, nor modify the substan­
        tive rights of any litigant. They shall take effect six months
        after their promulgation, and thereafter all laws in conflict
        therewith shall be of no further force or effect.
           SEC. 2. The court may at any time unite the general rules
        prescribed by it for cases in equity with those in actions at
        law so as to secure one form of civil action and procedure for
        both: Provided, however, That in such union of rules the right
        of trial by jury as at common law and declared by the seventh
        amendment to the Constitution shall be preserved to the par­
        ties inviolate. Such united rules shall not take effect until
        they shall have been reported to Congress by the Attorney
        General at the beginning of a regular session thereof and
        until after the close of such session.
       The Conference, at the suggestion of the Chief Justice,
     considered appropriate methods for assisting the Supreme
     Court in the discharge of this highly important and difficult
     task, through the cooperation of the members of the Bench
     and Bar throughout the country, to the end that the views
     of the federal judges and of the Bar may find adequate
     and helpful expression.
       For the Judicial Conference:
                                        CHABLES   E. HUGHES,
                                                    Chief Justice.
       October 1, 1934.

                                                                           ~
