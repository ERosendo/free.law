       REPORT OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE.
               SPECIAIJ SES;';ION, 1944.




  A special session of the Judicial Conference of Senior
Circuit Judges was convened on April 15, 1944, on the call
of the Chief Justice, and continued in session throughout
the day. The following judges were present:
   The Chief Justice, presiding,
  First Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Calvert Magruder,
   Second Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Learned Hand,
   Third Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge John Biggs, Jr.
   Fourth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge John J. Parker,
   Fifth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Samuel H. Sibley,
   Sixth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Xenophon Hicks,
   Seventh Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Evan A. Evans,
  Eighth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Kimbrough Stone,
   Ninth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Curtis D. 1Vilbur,
   Tenth Circuit, Senior Circuit Judge Orie L. Phillips,
   District of Columbia, Chief Justice D. Lawrence Groner.
   The Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts, Henry P. Chandler, the Assistant Director,
Elmore vvnitehurst, and other members of the staff of the
Administrative Office were in attendance.
   The meeting was called to consider various matters re­
lating to the establishment of the system of official court
reporters provided by the Act of January 20, 1944, Public
Law No.          The Act provides for the appointment of
one or more court reporters for each District Court of the
United States, and permits the combination of the duties
of reporter with those of any other employee of the court,
if approved by the Judicial Conference. It provides that
the Judicial Conference shall determine the number of re­
porters to be appointed and fix their salaries.
   The Conference resolved that for each district there be
authorized, if requested by the district judges, the appoint­
ment of a number of reporters equal to the number of ac­
                               2

tive district judges appointed for the district, and that in
those instances where judges are appointed for more than
one district, the appointment be authorized, if requested,
of one reporter for each such judge, to serve in the districts
for which the judge is appointed.
   It was resolved that court reporters not serving the court
in any other capacity be classified into five classes, at an­
nual salaries of $3,000.00, $3,600.00, $4,000.00, $4,500.00, and
$5,000.00, and that in the determination of the appropriate
classification for each reporter consideration be given to (1)
the recommendations of the district judges for the district
in which the appointment is to be made, which had been
submitted prior to the convening of the Conference through
the respective senior circuit judges; (2) the number of ses­
sions of the district court held during the year; (3) the
number of days spent during the year in trial or argument
of cases in the district court; (4) the population of the dis­
trict and the cost of living in the locality; (5) the amount
of time during which the reporter would be required to be
in attendance upon the court engaged in the performance
of his duties, and the opportunities available to him to earn
additional compensation for work unrelated to his position
as federal court reporter; and (6) relevant special circum­
stances, including the cost of similar services in the locality.
It was the understanding of the Conference that one of the
purposes of Congress in adopting the court reporter bill
was to reduce the cost to litigants of reportorial service,
and it was accordingly agreed that the salaries should be
so fixed as to provide the principal source of income for
the court reporter, in order that transcript fees could be
kept as low as is practicable. It was further resolved that
all action taken by the Conference in the fixing of salaries
for reporters be regarded as tentative, and that the entire
subject be reconsidered at the regular Conference of Senior
Circuit Judges in 1945 on the basis of the experience which
would be acquired in the meantime.
   The Conference further resolved that should any re­
porters be appointed for temporary service not exceeding
                             3

three months, as authorized by the Act, such reporters
should be compensated at a per diem rate equivalent to
the usual rates charged in the locality for comparable ser­
vices, and should be allowed to charge the transcript fees
prescribed for the district.
   The Conference resolved that the district courts be re­
quested to prescribe the fees to be charged for transcripts
as required by the Act, and to submit the results of their
action to the Director by June 15, 1944, for presentation to
the Conference at its next annual session for its approval
or disapproval.
   It was resolved that it was the sense of the Conference
that the fifteen per cent additional compensation provided
by the War Overtime Pay Act of 1943, Public Law No. 49,
does not apply to the salaries to be paid to court reporters,
including the total salaries prescribed by the Conference
for court reporters whose functions are combined with
those of other court employees.
   It was resolved that it was the sense of the Conference
that the duty of the court reporter to "transcribe and cer­
tify all pleas and proceedings in connection with the impo­
sition of sentence in criminal cases", prescribed by the
Court Reporter Act, does not include the transcription of
evidence and of the argument of counsel unless such tran­
scription is ordered by the district judge.
  It was the sense of the Conference that each reporter
should devote his personal services to the duties of his
position, but that when he needs assistance for the pur­
pose of furnishing transcripts of proceedings currently or
for other reasons he should be permitted to employ assis­
tants satisfactory to the judge of the court whose proceed­
ings he is reporting, to be compensated by the reporter.
   The Director was authorized to present to Congress an
estimate for the appropriations for the court reporter sys­
tem ill accordance with the figures for reporters' salaries
approved by the Conference, plus an estimated sum of
$30,000.00 for transcripts of records for persons permitted
to sue or defend as poor persons and an estimated sum of
$33,000.00 for travel expenses of reporters, the estimate
                             4

for the fiscal year 1945 to be based on operations for three­
quarters of the year beginning October 1, 1944. Together
with the foregoing the Director was authorized to present
to Congress an estimate of $133,000 for a deficiency ap­
propriation for fees of -eDited States Commissioners. The
Conference authorized the members of the Advisory Com­
mittee to give their support in such way as seemed to them
advisable in the presentation to the Congress of the esti­
mate for the appropriation for the court reporting system.
  The Conference deferred until the next annual session
the determination of standards of qualifications for court
reporters.
  In conformity to the foregoing resolutions the Confer­
ence authorized the appointment of the following numbers
of reporters for the district courts for the several judicial
districts and fixed their annual salaries at the following
amounts:

      at $5,000.00, to be available throughout the year, and
