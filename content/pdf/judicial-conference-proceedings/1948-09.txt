                              RESOLUTION

        MEMORIAL TO CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES EVANS HUGHES

       The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with
    profound regret and deep sorrow the passing of Chief Justice
    Hughes, who presided over its sessions from 1930 to 1940.
    Seldom does it fall to the lot of any man to render distinguished
    service in so many different fields as did Chief Justice Hughes.
    As a practicing lawyer, as Governor of the State of New York,
                                                                        o

    Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, nominee of his party
    for the Presidency, Secretary of State of the United States,
    member of the World Court and finally Chief Justice of the
    United States, he made a record as a lawyer, a statesman, and
    a judge which is unique in our country's history. By common
    consent he is accorded a place among the greatest jurists of
    the English speaking peoples.
       One of the great services of Chief Justice Hughes to the
    cause of justice was that which he rendered as Chairman of this
    Judicial Conference, which had been created during the Chief
    Justiceship of his predecessor, Chief Justice Taft. It was dur­
    ing his Chairmanship that the Administrative Office Act was
    passed.     Under that act the federal judiciary was
    freed from dependence upon an executive department of the
    government with respect to fiscal and administrative matters
    in the federal courts and was given adequate power of se1£­
    regulation and supervision. It was he who set up the Admin­
    istrative Office and assured its success by bringing to its sup­
    port his own splendid powers of administration, and it was he
    who, in the administration of the Rules of Procedure Act, se­
    cured for the country a modernized and efficient system of legal
                                  3

     procedure in keeping with modern conditions which has revo­
     lutionized the practice of the federal courts.
        As a jurist, Chief Justice Hughes will rank with Marshall
     and Taney. As an administrator, he has never been surpassed
     by any man who has held judicial office in this country. The
     members of the Conference will always be grateful for the
     opportunity which was theirs to come in touch with his vibrant
     and forceful personality; and the judiciary of the country will
     ever be indebted to him for the service that he rendered in
     infusing the processes of justice with efficiency and order. He
     wrought mightily in his generation and has left a record of
     achievement which will be an inspiration for years to come
     to those who are engaged in the administration of justice.

                              RESOLUTION

                  MEMORIAL TO JUDGE EVAN A. EVANS
        Evan Alfred Evans was born on a farm near the small town
     of Spring Green, Wisconsin, March 19, 1876. His father, a
     Welshman by birth, came to this country early in life and
     served with distinction in the Union Army. His mother, also
     of Welsh stock, was a native of the State of Pennsylvania.

o
   (It seems noteworthy that twice in the year 1948, Americans
     have paused to honor the memory of judges with a lineage
     reaching back to the hills of Wales, Charles Evans Hughes and
     Evan A. Evans.)
        Good parentage, the give and take of living in a large family
     of brothers and sisters, farm life and small town life endowed
     Evan A. Evans with a down-to-earth knowledge and love of
     people and their daily concerns. (It is noteworthy also, as
     honors came to him later in life, he held to the community in
     which he was born and maintained a home at nearby Baraboo
     until his death.)
       This knowledge and love of people was accompanied by a
     gentle humor and a balanced view of life which was never to
     desert him, even through the exciting years which were to
     carry him to first honors in the Colleges of Liberal Arts and
     Law at his own University of Wisconsin.
       His scholastic honors, and his interest and success at the
     University in debate and public speaking forecast his success­
     ful career as a lawyer; a career in which he was so successful
     that in the short period of sixteen years, and from a practice
     centering around the small town of Baraboo, he was to argue
     nearly a hundred cases before the Supreme Court of his state.
       From such eminence as a lawyer he made the transition,
     without intervening office-holding, to the Federal Circuit
                                  4


    bench for the Seventh Judicial Circuit in the year 1916, where
    he was to sit until removed by death on July 7, 1948. He be­         .1""
    came the Senior Judge in point of service in 1934.
       His work on the bench is a matter of public record; but the         "­
    zest which he brought to it may not be. In a talk before a Ju­
    dicial Conference in the Sixth Circuit, he once remarked that
    never had he left the bench after hearing an argument that he
    did not wish to write the opinion therein. And we are told
    that the cases in which he sat as a Circuit Judge numbered
    over four thousand.
       His attainments inside and outside his profession were
    great; his interests were broad; and his virtues many. But
    his associates of this Conference will probably remember him
    longest for his essential humanity-for his "plain and simple
    mental and moral excellencies" as a life-long friend once put
    it. His was a life of simplicity and straight thinking; of kindli­
    ness and humor-which was suffused with an innate, if in­
    formal, personal dignity. Even among judges, Evan A. Evans
    will probably be remembered longest as a man.

             MEMORIAL TO JUDGE FRANCIS A. GARRECHT

       The members of The Judicial Conferenee of the United
                                                                         e
    States with deep regret feel the absence from our meetings of
    the late Franeis A. Garrecht.
       He brought to us the wisdom of the experience of his wide
    practice, beginning in the vanishing frontier of eastern Wash­
    ington, in his helpfulness to and understanding of its Indian
    people, his vigorous service as a United States Attorney, and
    his long years on the Court of Appeals.
       We will miss the wholesome advice of his wide experience,
    his kindly personality, and his cheerful nature. We all unite
    in sending to the members of his family, our sympathy in the
    loss of their father and our friend.

  The retirement of the Honorable D. Lawrence Groner, Chief
Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, who for many years participated as a member of the
Conference, was announced by the Chief Justi('p.. The Confer­
ence thereupon adopted the following resolution:
                              RESOLUTION

      The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with
    sincere regret the retirement from active judicial service of
                                  5


     Honorable D. Lawrence Groner, Chief Justice of the United
     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, who was
     for many years one of the ablest and most useful members of
     the Conference.
        Chief Justice Groner brought to his duties as a member of
      the Conference a wealth of experience gleaned from long
     service in the Judiciary of the United States and prior to that
     as Referee in Bankruptcy and as United States Attorney. As
     District Judge of the United States for the Eastern District of
     Virginia his record was outstanding. As a Justice of the
     United States Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia,
     and later as Chief Justice of that Court, he rendered dis­
     tinguished service and succeeded in having that tribunal
     accorded its proper place as one of the most important courts
     of the United States. As a member of the Conference he was
     active in its labors and in the work of its committees in solv­
     ing the many problems confronting the judiciary of our coun­
     try. No one has done more than he to bring about the present
     efficient organization of the federal courts and the proper
     recognition by the people of the country of the importance of
     the business in which they are engaged. His wisdom was a
     source of strength to the Conference and his knowledge of men
     and affairs of inestimable value in dealing with other branches

o	   of government.
        Chief Justice Groner greatly endeared himself personally to
     all the members of the Conference. His wisdom and sound
      judgment, his breadth of view and profound learning, made
     him a leader in all of our undertakings, but it was his kindness
      of heart, his innate courtesy and courtliness and his unfailing
     sympathy and understanding which endeared him to us as a
     companion and a friend. We shall miss him in our meetings,
     and we tender him upon his retirement this expression of our
     affection and esteem with the fervent hope that we may con­
     tinue to have the benefit of his wise counsel for many years to
     come, and that the evening of his life may be happy, and rich
     with the fruits of the many years spent in the faithful service
     of his country and the cause of justice and right.


   The Chief Justice stated that, pursuant to the provisions of the
 United States Code (Title 28 U. S. Code § 45 (c)) and upon the
 certification of Senior Circuit Judge Samuel H. Sibley of the Fifth
 Judicial Circuit, Judge Sibley had been relieved of his duties as
 Chief Judge; and that, because of this action, Judge Sibley also
 withdrew as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United

States. The following resolution was thereupon adopted by the
Conference:
                              RESOLUTION

       Whereas Honorable Samuel H. Sibley, Judge of the United
    States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, who has for
    many years rendered a judicial service of high order, and who
    is justly recognized as one of the ablest members of the federal
    judiciary, was a member of this Judicial Conference from
    1942 to 1947,
       And whereas since the last convening of this Judicial Con­
    ference, he has reHnquished his powers and duties as Senior
    Circuit Judge in respect of administrative matters and his
    place in the Conference,
       And whereas Judge Sibley has exercised such powers and
    performed such duties with great wisdom, with a constant eye
    to the effective administration of justice in our Courts, and
    in such a capable, fair, and impartial manner that he has
    earned the love, respect and esteem of every member of this
    Conference; and by his wise judgment and from his wealth of
    experience he has made many worthwhile contributions to the
    work of the Conference and to the solution of the difficult
    problems that came before us:
       Now, therefore, be it resolved, that this Conference does
    hereby express its appreciation for the distinguished manner
    in which Judge Sibley has executed the administrative re­
                                                                        0
    sponsibilities lately relinquished by him, that we miss his
    valued counsel, his warm hand of friendship and his genial
    personality, that we convey to him our felicitations and best
    wishes, and that we hereby extend to him our sincere hope that
    he will continue many years to come to serve in his judicial
    capacity.

               REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

  The Report of the Attorney General of the United States (Hon­
orable Tom C. Clark) to the Judicial Conference was presented by
the Solicitor General, Honorable Philip B. Perlman. The report is
as follows:
    MR. 	C HIEF JUSTICE, MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE
        OF THE UNITED STATES, HONORED GUESTS:
       Once again it is my privilege and pleasure to appear before
    the annual meeting of the Judicial Conference of the United
    States. In my opinion, the work of these conferences consti­

                                                                        -
    tutes one of the most important single elements in the admin­
    istration of justice in the federal courts. For out of these con­
    ferences come the suggestions designed to make the litigation
    process in the federal courts speedier, less complicated, less
                              "




burdensome, and less expensive. In some cases, legislation is
necessary to accomplish the desired purpose; in others, you
gentlemen are able to do this by means within your own power.
But however the beneficial result is ultimately achieved, the
point is that it is here that the ideas are born, discussed, and
developed in an impartial spirit of cooperation. Without a
process of this sort, the development and improvement of the
machinery for the efficient administration of justice would be
hampered. Again let me say that I consider it a distinct privi­
lege to be a part, however small, of this process.
   Mr. Chandler, the Director of the Administrative Office, was
kind enough to make his annual report to the Conference avail­
able to me. What I considered as one of the most important
parts of that report disturbed me a great deal. At several
points in the report, Mr. Chandler referred to the high inci­
dence throughout the country of disability of federal judges
on account of illness. He pointed out that, during the last
year, at least 20 circuit and district court judges were partially
or totally incapacitated for long periods of time because of
illness. These illnesses were in large measure attributable to
overstrain in work. And many other judges, not actually in­
capacitated, were beginning to show signs of nervous exhaus­
tion. This situation is alarming and is painful evidence of the
tremendous volume of work borne by you gentlemen of the
judiciary. It emphasizes all too well the necessity for speedy
appointments to judicial vacancies as well as the need for more
judges to cope with the increasing burden of litigation in the
federal courts. As far as filling judicial vacancies is concerned,
the President has endeavored to fill each vacancy as rapidly as
possible consistently with the established policy of securing
men eminently qualified for judicial office. As for the neces­
sity of additional judges, I shall continue to recommend the
enactment of legislation increasing the number of federal
judges where needed, so that the work of the federal courts
can be carried on with dispatch, at the same time permitting
the judges the necessary time for reflection and deliberation in
judgment. Without a reasonably adequate number of judges
to handle the volume of increasingly difficult litigation in the
federal courts, the judicial system of the United States cannot
properly perform its function, no matter how many times the
court rules are revised or the statutes codified.
   And speaking of codifications, I should like to refer only
briefly to the recent enactment by the Congress of the revisions
of the Criminal and Judicial Codes. A more detailed refer­
ence to those enactments before this group would indeed be
 presumptuous on my part. However, I should like to point
out that these codifications are truly significant advances. The
fact that these codes make relatively few substantive changes
in the law should not lead us to underestimate their importance
                             8


in the administration of justice in the federal courts. In the
first place, the Criminal and Judicial Codes, having been
enacted by the Congress, are now the law and not merely
prima facie evidence of it. Both the bench and the bar will
now be spared the time-consuming and unpleasant task of
going to the Statutes at Large in order to ascertain the pre­
cise language of a particular law. I should imagine that only
a very small percentage of the Nation's lawyers have easy
access to sets of the United States Statutes at Large. More
important still, these codifications substitute plain language
for awkward phrases, reconcile conflicting statutes, omit super­
seded sections, and consolidate similar and related provisions.
The difficult task of tracing the provisions of a statute through
all its amendments will in large measure now be eliminated.
    It is indeed a pleasure for a lawyer to pick up the new
Criminal Code and read in Section 1, in plain and simple lan­
guage, that "Any offense punishable by death or imprisonment
for a term exceeding one year is a felony," that "Any other
offense is a misdemeanor" and that "Any misdemeanor, the
penalty for which does not exceed imprisonment for a period
of 6 months or a fine of not more than $500, or both, is a petty
offense." You gentlemen are aware of the difficult problems
that had arisen concerning the interpretation of these terms
prior to this enactment.
   I should like to mention just one significant substantive
change made in the Criminal Code. That change appears in
Section 371 which increases the penalty for conspiracy to
                                                                    o
commit an offense against or to defraud the United States
from 2 to 5 years. If, however, the offense, the commission
 of which is the object of the conspiracy, is only a misdemeanor,
 the maximum p.unishment for such conspiracy cannot exceed
 the maximum punishment for commission of the misde­
 meanor. This Section 371 remedies a well-known inadequacy
 in the old conspiracy statute, and recognizes the injustice of
 permitting a felony punishment for conspiracy to commit a
 misdemeanor.
    As you know, the Judicial Code was enacted as Section 1
 of Public Law 773 of the 80th Congress. Public Law 773,
 however, is a statute composed of 38 sections. The impor­
 tance of the Judicial Code itself and the publicity in legal
 circles attached to its enactment may cause us to overlook
 some of the provisions contained in those other sections. I
 should like to mention just one-Section 36. That section
 amends Section 1141 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code deal­
 ing with review in the Courts of Appeals of decisions of the
 Tax Court of the United States. The amendment now pro­
 vides that the Courts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction to
 review decisions of the Tax Court of the United States, "in
 the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of dis­        -
                             9

trict courts in civil actions tried without a jury." I need
scarcely tell you that, following the decision in Dobson v. Com­
missioner, 320 U. S. 489, almost every case in the Courts of
Appeals coming from the Tax Court contained some prob­
lem respecting the proper scope of review to be exercised by
the Courts of Appeals. Conflicting views concerning the pre­
cise meaning of the Dobson decision proved to be a major and
recurring source of controversy, In enacting Section 36, the
Congress made it clear that the rule of the Dobson decision
was intended to be repealed. Difficult questions of judicial
review were, of course, never limited or confined to cases com­
ing from the Tax Court, and will still persist under Section 36.
The problem in Tax Court cases, however, will now be the
same as in civil cases coming from district courts where trial
was had without a jury.
    The report of the Director of the Administrative Office dis­
cusses a subject which is of particular interest to my Depart­
ment. That is the probation system. As you know, a federal
prisoner, when released on parole, is in the legal custody and
under control of the Attorney General. By statute, each pro­
bation officer appointed by the federal district courts to super­
vise probationers is required, in addition, to perform such
duties with respect to persons on parole as the Attorney Gen­
eral shall request. And as the report of the Director of the
Administrative Office points out, during the fiscal year 1948
about 6,000 parolees were supervised by probation officers.
The efficiency of the probation system is, therefore, of vital
concern to me. I am interested in an efficient probation sys­
tem not merely because of the invaluable assistance that serv­
ice has given me in connection with my duties with respect to
 parolees. I am more interested in an efficient probation serv­
 ice from the point of view of what it can do for the probationer.
 He is, in general, the less confirmed type of offender who has
 not been exposed to the contaminating influences of prison.
 The chances of rehabilitation are generally good. And, as Mr.
 Chandler points out, an efficient probation service, if ade­
 quately supported, is the most promising means of rehabilita­
 tion. An efficient probation service can help prevent the pro­
 bationer from ever becoming a parolee. I agree with Mr.
 Chandler that an average case load per probation officer of 114
 persons under supervision, in addition to 106 investigations, is
 much too heavy a load to permit a really constructive job to
 be achieved. I agree that additional probation officers should
 be appointed. I feel sure that money so spent will prove in the
 long run to be an economy. Every case of a probationer re­
 habilitated who never has to see the inside of a prison consti­
 tutes a money savings to the United States. The benefits to
 society at large are so great and so obvious that nothing need
  to be said here in that regard.
                            10
    When I spoke to you last year, I suggested the advisability
of the adoption at an early date of uniform rules for all the
Courts of Appeals, particularly with reference to the prepara­
tion and contents of records and briefs on appeaL I was glad
to read in the Report of the Conference for last year that the
Conference directed the material and data which I submitted
to you to be circulated to the members of the Conference.
However, I was disappointed to find that uniformity has not
been accomplished. Further and diverse changes in the rules
of individual courts have accentuated the problem. I con­
sider it appropriate, therefore, to call your attention to this
problem once again. The adoption of uniform rules would
contribute to a more efficient and economical dispatch of the
Government's business, for it is the Government which would
be the principal beneficiary, appearing, as it does, in all the
Courts of Appeals.
    I would like at this time to say a few words concerning the
experience of the Department of Justice in the trial of anti­
trust cases. Antitrust cases are usually of great complexity
and in the past have required the argument of numerous mo­
tions before they actually came on for triaL These motions
have related to discovery of documents, interrogatories, bills
of particulars, jurisdiction over defendants, and many other
preliminary matters. When such a case is pending in a court
composed of many judges and having a large volume of busi­
ness, the various motions necessary from time to time have
come on for hearing before the judge who happens to be as­
 signed to the motion calendar at the time the motion is made.
 This has resulted in the need on the part of each judge to
 familiarize himself with comprehensive and highly involved
pleadings and issues, as well as the course of prior proceedings
 in the case. This requires a great deal of time on the part of
 all the attorneys and necessitates each judge to master all the
 facts which have already been mastered by another judge.
This procedure is burdensome, and I think that it can in large
measure be alleviated.
    In a case filed in the Southern District of New York on
October 30, 1947 (United States v. Henry S. Morgan, et al.),
the defendants named were 131 individual partners, 10 co­
partnerships, 7 corporations, and 1 association engaged in the
investment banking business. The complaint charged the
defendants, who are the principal investment bankers in the
country, with a conspiracy to monopolize and restrain the
 security business of the country. Nine large New York la'w
 firms entered appearances for the defendants. Motions for
 extensions of time within which to move or answer, and for an .....
 order for the taking of a deposition, were filed and argued be-_
 fore Judge Bright.
    In anticipation that a large number of motions would be
                             11 

 filed and that complex and intricate pretrial proceedings
 would be undertaken, the Government filed a motion for an
order designating one judge to hear all motions and other
 matters preliminary to trial, to conduct all pretrial procedure,
 and to preside at the trial. In support of this motion, the
 Government argued that, in a case of this magnitude and
 complexity, much time would be wasted in acquainting various
 judges with the factual background necessary to rule intelli­
 gently on the motions and other matters of substance and
 procedure.
    The Senior Judge in the Southern District of New York,
Honorable John C. Knox, granted this motion in the following
 words:
    "The procedure that the Government suggests be followed
with respect to the within entitled litigation is not entirely
without precedent in the District Courts of the United States.
A somewhat similar practice prevails, I understand, in the
Southern District of California, the Northern District of Illi­
nois, and the Eastern District of Michigan. Furthermore, in
this court, it is customary for a judge who first has occasion
to deal with a reorganization proceeding under Section 1 of the
Bankruptcy Act to retain jurisdiction thereof until the same
is concluded.
    "From what was said at the time this motion came on for
hearing, it appears that this suit involves a complicated and
intricate state of facts, and one which presents numerous ques­
tions of law. If a particular judge be assigned to handle the
case, he will be able to familiarize himself with all its details
and thus, as the litigation proceeds, bring about an economy
of time and effort on the part of the court that otherwise
would not be possible. For this reason, the motion will be
granted, and the case assigned to the Honorable Harold R.
Medina."
    Nearly a score of separate answers were filed by the de­
fendants, and interrogatories were propounded by a number of
the defendants. Objections were made thereto, briefs filed,
and arguments heard thereon. Requests were made by the
Government for admissions as to matters of fact and as to au­
thenticity of documents, and the Government filed notices
for the taking of depositions. Objections were made to the re­
quests for admissions, and application was made by the de­
fendants for a ruling prohibiting the Government from taking
further depositions. These matters were also argued before
the Court. Following the hearing on these various matters, the
Court issued a comprehensive order interpreting the com­
plaint, setting forth the positions of the plaintiff and the
defendants with respect to many portions thereof, establishing
a "committee" to represent all of the various attorneys in
dealing with plaintiff's demand for admissions, and outlining
                             12 

a procedure to be followed by the plaintiff in making such
demands and by the defendants in replying thereto. A pro­
cedure was established to be followed in securing agreement,
or at least in defining or limiting the areas of disagreement, of
the parties as to accuracy of statistical tabulations and charts,
providing for the marking and tabulation of documents and
the exchange thereof between plaintiff and defendants, pro­
viding for taking of depositions, and specifying those portions
of the defendants' interrogatories which the plaintiff should
answer and the method to be followed in answering.
   As a result of the assignment of one judge to the case who
became familiar with the various contentions and tactics of
the attorneys for defendants and for the plaintiff, and who
was able by reason of his knowledge of the case to interpret
and narrow areas of disagreement, an expeditious method
was established which effectively disposed of the necessity for
many motions and arguments thereon. The preparation for
the trial of this complex and important case is much further
advanced and the issues which will remain for trial will be
much more limited, than any of the parties thought would
be possible. If a single judge had not been assigned, it is
probable that pretrial discovery and procedure would have
consumed as much as two or three years. The assignment of
Judge Medina, and the procedure adopted by him, will prob­
ably result in the trial and disposition of this case within a
few months.
   A similar procedure was followed in another case pending
                                                                    c
in the Southern District of New York (United States v. Im­
perial Chemical Industries, Ltd.). In that case, Judge Knox
entered an order assigning the case to Judge Sylvester J. Ryan.
   I t is believed that aU parties to this type of litigation are
finding this method of developing a case highly desirable. It
is hoped that all the district courts will look with favor upon
suggestions made by the Government in future antitrust cases
that they be assigned to one judge to hear all matters in
connection therewith.
   l\lr. Chandler has mentioned a problem to me that is not
discussed in his report to this Conference. That is the cost
of service of process in civil cases on parties located at a con­
siderable distance from the United States Marshal. Mr.
Chandler referred to one situation where the case involved
something like $114 and the Marshal's cost for travel and
subsistence was some $50 or $60. While this, of course, is not
the typical situation, I do think, however, that something can
be done to reduce the cost of service of process in many cases.
   Rule 4 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures provides
that "service of all process shall be made by a United States
Marshal, by his deputy, or by some person specially appointed
by the court for that purpose * * *." The rule continues
                             13 

that "special appointments to serve processes shall be made
freely when substantial savings in travel fees will result." I
think that in general the routine has developed of the clerk
delivering summonses to the Marshal's office which then serves
them without too much regard to the location of the parties
to be served. I believe that something can be done to effec­
tuate a savings in this regard. It seems to me that a recom­
mendation of this Conference calling this matter to the at­
tention of the district judges, together with a circular from
my office to the United States Marshals can do the job. I
shall be glad to have a member of my staff cooperate with
anyone appointed by this Conference in working out a suit­
able procedure for calling to the attention of the courts and the
marshals the desirability and necessity for special appoint­
ments for service of process in appropriate cases.
   When I addressed the Conference last year I stated that
during the fiscal year 1947, 675 cases had been filed under the
Federal Tort Claims Act. I predicted that a much larger
number would be filed this year. The report of the Director
of your Administrative Office shows that during the fiscal year
1948 in excess of 1,500 cases arising under the Tort Claims
Act were filed. You can well appreciate the burden that this
increase in litigation has cast upon the Department. But we
will continue to try our best to process these cases as expedi­
tiously as possible. Last year I indicated some of the inter­
esting problems involved in tbis tort claims litigation. Other
problems of equal interest and importance have arisen this
year. In general, the litigation, insofar as the strictly legal
questions are involved, has paralleled to a large extent the
litigation arising out of the Tucker Act. Undoubtedly many
of these problems will reach the Courts of Appeals during the
coming year.
   I was disappointed, as I know you were, because of the fail­
ure of enactment of the bill to provide for the care and cus­
tody of insane persons charged with or convicted of offenses
against the United States. The Department of Justice has
worked in close harmony with Judge Magruder and other
members of his committee in behalf of this much needed legis­
lation. The bill was actually passed by the Senate on June 10,
1948, and was referred to the Judiciary Committee of the
House on the following day. It made no further progress
toward enactment, however. Recommendations should be re­
newed at the next session of Congress for the speedy enact­
ment of this bill.
   When the Congress adjourned on August 7, 1948, there was
pending before the JUdiciary Committee of the House the bill
recommended by this Conference to raise from $10 to $15 a
day the limit on subsistence expenses allowed to Federal judges
while traveling on official duties away from their headquarters.

      The limitation of $10 a day as provided for in existing law
      has not been increased since it was authorized for circuit court
      judges in 1891 and for district court judges in 1911. I sincerely
      hope that this measure will be enacted into law during the
      coming session of the Congress. As Mr. Chandler has pointed
      out, the present limitation has proved to be a serious handicap
      in the effort to find judges available for assignment outside
      of their districts.
         I was glad to see that the Congress has enacted the legisla­
      tion to increase the fees and expense allowances of jurors.
      I was also glad to note that section 1861 of the new Judicial
      Code now establishes uniform qualifications for jurors through­
      out the Federal court system.
         I wish to say in conclusion, as I did last year, that we of
      the Department of Justice share with the courts a real sense
      of responsibility for the proper operation of our laws. We feel
      that we are much more than the principal litigant before you.
      We consider it our duty and privilege to answer your call for
      assistance and cooperation in any matter which involves the
      machinery of the federal judicial system. We welcome the
      opportunity to assist this Conference in any way we can.
      As I stated before, the work of this Conference is to me one
      of the most important single elements in the administration
      of federal justice.
          ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES CoURTS

   Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts.I-The Director submitted his ninth annual report
reviewing the activities of his office for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1948, including the report of the Division of Procedural Studies
and Statistics. The Conference ordered the report received, and
authorized its immediate release for pUblication. The Director was
authorized to incorporate statistical data not now available, and
to correct errors of a nonsubstantive nature, in the printed edition
of the report to be issued later.
  State of the Dockets of the Federal Courts-Courts of Appeals.­
The declining trend in the number of cases filed annually in the
courts of appeals, which was in evidence from 1940 to 1947, was
arrested in the fiscal year 1948, which showed an increase of 5 per­
cent, from 2,615 cases commenced in 1947 to 2,758 in 1948. The
courts showing the largest proportionate increases were those of the
District of Columbia Circuit with an increase of one-third, and of
the Fifth and Tenth Circuits with increases of one-fifth each.
  1 For convenience, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts,
and the Administrative Of!lce of the United States Courts, are hereinafter referred to as the
DIrector, aDd the Administrative Office, reSl)ectively.

Cases terminated were somewhat less in number than those com­
menced, with a resulting rise to 1,673 in the caseload pending at
the end of the year. Most of the gain over 1947 in the number of
cases commenced was in appeals from the district courts. The
number of appeals from administrative agencies and particularly
from the National Labor Relations Board was less than in the pre­
vious year.
   Five hundred and ninety-seven petitions for review on writ of
certiorari to the United States courts of appeals were filed in the
Supreme Court in 1948, as compared with 614 in 1947. Twelve and
seven-tenths percent of the petitions disposed of in 1948 were
granted. In civil cases in which the United States was a party,
16.1 percent of the petitions were granted; in criminal cases, 14.2
percent; in private civil cases, 10.6 percent; and in administrative
appeals, 7.9 percent.
   The median time interval for all circuits from the date of the
filing of the complete record to the time of disposition by the court
was 6.3 months. For the period from hearing or submission to de­
cision, the median period for all circuits was but 1.6 months and in
no circuit did it exceed 2.7 months. From filing in the district court
to decision in the appellate court, considering only cases heard or
submitted in the courts of appeals, the median was 21.4 months.
    District Courts.-In the district courts a substantial decrease oc­
curred in the number of civil cases filed, but this was confined to
cases in which the goVernment was a party. The number of civil
cases terminated slightly exceeded the number commenced but the
reverse was true as to private cases, which constitute, for the judges,
the most time-consuming part of the caseload. The trend is shown
by the number of civil cases commenced and terminated annually
for the past 10 years, giving separately the figures for all civil cases
and for private civil cases:

   From this table it will be seen that the number of "all civil cases"
commenced annually dropped sharply both in 1947 and 1948 after
an abrupt rise in 1945 and a further increase in 1946. These fluc­
tuations were caused mainly by changes in the number of actions
brought each year by federal officials to enforce price control and
rationing regulations. The number of cases of this kind filed in
the last five years has been as follows:
                                                           Price and rationing

   The effect of the war was to decrease all classes of civil litigation
in the federal courts, both government and private, other than
price and rationing cases. Since the termination of the war there
has been a rapid rise in the volume of private civil cases. The result
is that the total number of civil cases filed in 1948 was one-third
greater than the 1938-41 average and the number of private eases
was 40 percent larger.
   The increase in the number of private cases pending is paxtic­                I"f
ularly significant in the light of a report by the Statistics Commit­            \,J.
tee of the Conference that 11 district judges who kept time records
over a 3-months period spent approximately three times as many
hours in court and chambers in heaxing and deciding private cases
as they devoted to government cases. The 29,899 private cases
that remained undisposed of on the dockets on June 30, 1948 were
more than the number terminated during the entire previous yeax
and were 39 percent more than the 1938-41 annual average of the
pending private caseload at the end of the year.
   The increase over the prewar average in the number of private
cases filed has been principally in contract and tort cases brought
under the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction of the courts. A rise
in the numbers of other personal injury actions such as those by
railroad employees under the Employers' Liability Act and by sea­
men under the Jones Act has been particularly responsible for an
increase in cases between private parties arising out of federal stat­
utory rights of action. There is a marked increase in private ad­
miralty suits as compared with the prewar period as a result of
shipping activity during and after the war.                                      ~
   The heavier burden on the courts during the past year is also                  --'
reflected in the increased median time of 9.9 months in 1948 from
                                     17 

    filing to disposition of civil cases (excluding land condemnation,
    forfeiture and habeas corpus cases) disposed of after trial in the
    84 districts in the states compared with 9.0 months in 1947.
       The number of criminal cases filed in the district courts in 1948
    was 32,097, which was 4lf2 percent less than in 1947. After an
    increase during the war due to Selective Service Act cases and price
    and rationing prosecutions the number of proceedings commenced
    decreased and in 1948 reached the lowest point in 30 years with
    the exception of the year 1941. More cases were terminated than
    were commenced. Criminal cases receive precedence and the crim­
    inal dockets are in good condition. Of 7,851 cases pending at the
    end of the year, more than a quarter could not be tried because
    they involved fugitive defendants, leaving at the end of the year
    less than 6,000 pending criminal cases in which the defendants
    were available, or a little more than 9 weeks work at the current
    rate of disposition.
       The number of bankruptcy cases filed in 1948 continued the in­
    crease begun in the previous year by rising from 13,170 to 18,510
    as compared with a 45-year low of 10,196 cases begun in 1946.
    Cases terminated in 1948 numbered 10,742, with a resulting in­
D   crease in the caseload at the end of the year of almost 8,000 cases,
    to a total of 25,064.
                         ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

       General.-The Conference reviewed the state of the dockets,
    and the work of each of the district and circuit courts comprising
    the federal judiciary. Conditions relating to the courts within
    each particular circuit were discussed by the Chief Judge of that
    circuit, ~ll1d the Conference informed of matters peculiar to such
    courts. Statistical data relating to the current and prospective
    business of the courts were presented by the Director. The at­
    tention of the Conference was also directed to factors which, be­
    cause of their character, were impossible to weigh in these data,
    but which had a material and substantial effect upon the expedi­
    tious dispatch of the business of the courts. The prospects as to
    the availability of judges for assignments outside their own dis­
    tricts during the coming year were considered.
       I t was the sense of the Conference that the following action
    in respect of judgeships throughout the judiciary should be recom­
    mended; that such recommendations contemplated the absolute
    minimum increase in judgeships necessary to adequately man the
                                 18 


courts, and to provide for the continued efficient and orderly proc­
essingof the business of the courts.

  The Director was instructed to present these recommendations
to the Congre3s and to inform it that the prompt enactment of
         legislation necessary to achieve the objectives sought thereby wa~,
         in the view of the Conference, a matter of extreme urgency and
         importance to the judiciary.
                      SUPF'ORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS

            Chief Judge Biggs, Chairman of the Committee on Supporting
         Personnel of the United States Courts presented the report of the
         Committee.
            Salaries-The Administrative Office of the United States
         Courts.-In its efforts to secure legislative authority for the in­
         crease in the annual compensation of the Director and Assistant
         Director, as recommended by the Conference, the Committee was
         confronted with a legislative situation which made impracticable
         any attempt to secure independent action upon this proposal. At
         the time, there was under consideration a Congressional program
         contemplating a complete revision of the government's salary and
         classification structure. In view of this and the fact that, as a
         matter of practical necessity, the officials involved must stand with
         like officers of the government in salary matters, the Committee
         concluded that the most feasible method of obtaining the ultimate
'"."     objective was to have these positions included in the Congressional
.,       program, although the salaries provided thereunder would exceed
         in slight degree those recommended by the Conference. While the
         Committee was successful in having these positions incorporated
         within the program, efforts to secure passage of the legislation
         failed.
            The Conference was of the view that the Committee, under the
         circumstances, had acted properly and wisely, and approved its
         action. It directed that efforts should be made to secure increases
         in the salaries of the Director and Assistant Director to the extent
         that their annual compensation will equal in amount that which is
         finally approved for officers of comparable rank in the other
         branches of the Government.
            Salaries-Secretaries, Secretary-Law Clerks, and Law Clerks to
         Circuit and District Judges.-In 1943, the Conference adopted a
         plan of compensation and classification covering these employees.
         Under this plan, there was allocated, on a per annum basis, to each
         senior circuit judge, and to each senior district judge of courts of
         five or more district judges, the amount of $7,500, and to each of
 ,....   the other circuit and district judges the sum of $6,500, from which
...."    these employees would be paid. Due to lack of appropriations, the
         plan was not put into effect until the commencement of the fiscal
                                  20 

year 1946. It has now been in operation for 3 years and while, as a
whole, it has worked very well, the need for some practical
operating revisions has been clearly demonstrated.
   (A) The additional allowance of $1,000 to the first group of
judges was intended to enable them to procure additional assist­
ance needed because of their additional duties. Under the present
arrangement it is impossible for them to do this. This additional
assistance is imperative at this time and, in order to enable these
judges to employ a competent assistant secretary, as well as an
experienced secretary and law clerk, the present allowance should
be increased to $9,000.
  The present allowance of $6,500 to the other judges does not
enable them to employ a secretary and a law clerk both in the
higher grades. In order to enable them to do this their allowance
should be increased to $6,700 per year.
   (B) One of the difficulties which has developed under the plan
has been that if the salaries of a judge's secretary and law clerk
have reached the limit of the individual allotments, these employ­
ees are precluded from further participation in the promotional
plan, even though they are otherwise qualified to receive them.
This has resulted in inequities and should be corrected by the elim­
ination of the limitation on within-grade promotions involved
under the plan.
   (C) There have been a number of instances in which the work
of some judges has been impeded by the fact that their allowances
were insufficient to permit the securing of temporary assistance in
an emergency due to illness or other causes necessitating the ab­
sence of their regular employees. This should be corrected through
the deletion of this limitation from the plan.
  As indicated, the plan was implemented by Congress by the Ap­
propriation Act for the fiscal year 1946, viz., by congressional action
in 1945. The Congress gave recognition to this plan by adopting
as a proviso to the Appropriation Act of 1946 (practically in haec
verba) the resolution adopted by the Conference in 1943.
   The Committee proposed that the Conference recommend the
elimination of this proviso from future Judiciary Appropriation
Acts. It was pointed out that the proviso will no longer be prop­
erly a part of the Appropriation Act since positive law in § 604 (a)
(5) of Title 28 of the new Judicial Code provides that, under the
supervision and direction of the Judicial Conference, the Director
shall fix the compensation, among other employees, of law clerks
                                        21
     and secretaries, and a resolution of the Conference will itself have
     the force of law as an implementation of the statute.
        In order to carry into effect the changes in the present plan pro­
     posed by the Committee, and to insure to each judge the continua­
     tion of the right to classify his own employees, the Committee sub­
     mitted the following resolution with recommendation that it be
     adopted by the Conference:
                                   RESOLUTION
              Resolved, That the compensation of secretaries and law
            clerks of circuit and district judges shall be fixed by the Direc­
            tor of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
            without regard to the Classification Act of 1923, as amended,
            except that (exclusive of any additional compensation under
            the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945 and any other acts of
            similar purport subsequently enacted) the salary of a secre­
            tary shall conform with that of the main (CAF-4), senior
            (CAF-5), or principal (CAF-6) clerical grade, or assistant
            (CAF-7), or associate (CAF-8) administrative grade, as the
            appointing judge shall determine, and the salary of a law clerk
            shall conform with that of the junior (P-l), assistant (P-2),
            associate (P-3), full (P-4), or senior (P-5) professional
-	          grade, as the appointing judge shall determine, subject to re­
'.,; 	      view by the judicial council of the circuit if requested by the
            Director, such determination by the judge otherwise to be
            final: Provided, That (exclusive of any additional compensa­
            tion under the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945 and any
            other acts of similar purport subsequently enacted, or within­
            grade promotional increases and of compensation paid for
            temporary assistance needed because of an emergency) the
            aggregate salaries paid to secretaries and law clerks appointed
            by one judge shall not exceed $6,700 per annum, except in the
            case of the chief judge of each circuit and chief judge of each
            district court having five or more district judges in which case
            the aggregate salaries shall not exceed $9,000.
          The Conference adopted the following amendment to the reso­
       lution of the Committee:
               Further Resolved, that this resolution shall take effect as of
            July 1, 1949, and shall from and after that date supersede the
            resolution upon the same subject matter passed by the Judicial
            Conference at the September Session, 1943.
          The resolution, as amended, was thereupon approved by the
       Conference.
          Civil Service Status-Secretaries, Secretary-Law Clerks, and
       Law Clerks.-Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
       ference approved of efforts being made to secure legislation
                                 22 


which will permit a secretary, secretary-law clerk, or a law clerk, of
any federal justice or judge who has served for four years and who       £',

has been separated from the service involuntarily and without            -1., 

prejudice, to acquire a classified civil service status for transfer
purposes upon passing a noncompetitive civil seryice examination.
   Salaries, Classification and Promotional Plan-Court Criers.­
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved
the action of the Director in fixing the salaries of criers at a basic
salary of $1,800, plus the increase granted to federal employees
generally by the three Pay Acts, effective September 1, 1948, and
directed that these employees be classified at grade CAF-4 and
given the benefits of the promotional plan as of September 1, 1948,
the first promotion to become effective after September 1, 1949.
   Probation Office-District of Columbia.-Chief Judge Stephens
submitted the recommendation of the Judicial Conference for the
District of Columbia that legislation be enacted to bring the Pro­
bation Office of the District Court in the District of Columbia
under the Administrative Office for administrative purposes, in­
cluding appropriations.
   It was pointed out that the result of such an enactment would
assimilate the probation service for this district to the similar        ~'
service in the other judicial districts.                                 '",,_
   The recommendation had the full concurrence of both the Dis­
trict Court and the Judicial Conference for the District of
Columbia;
   The Conference concurred in the recommendation and directed
that efforts be made to secure the legislative action necessary to
accomplish the result desired.
   Register of Wills-District of Columbia.-Chief Judge Stephens
presented the recommendation of the Judicial Conference for the
District of Columbia that legislation be enacted to bring the Office
of the Register of Wills in the District of Columbia under the Ad­
ministrative Office for administrative purposes, including appro­
 prations therefor, and also that the appointment of the Register
 of Wills be made by the District Court instead of by the President
 of the United States.
   The recommendation had the full concurrence of both the
District Court and the Judicial Conference for the District of
Columbia.
    The Conference concurred in the recommendation and directed           A

 that efforts be made to secure the legislative action necessary to
 accomplish it.
-                TRAVEL AND SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCES

       General.-The Director reported that, pursuant to the directions
    of the Conference, efforts had been instituted during the last Con­
    gress to secure legislative action necessary to implement the recom­
    mendations of the Conference in respect of securing increases in
    the amounts available under existing statutory limitations for the
    reimbursement of allowable expenses incurred by judges and other
    personnel of the United States Courts while in an official "travel
    status." He stated that, although these endeavors were unsuccess­
    ful, some encouragement may be had from the fact that the Con­
    gress had been giving consideration to a proposal providing for an
    increase in travel allowance for employees of the Executive Branch
    of the government, and present indications were that some affirma­
    tive action would be taken thereon at the next session of the Con­
    gress. It was his view that, in the event of such action, similar
    consideration for the judiciary could be reasonably anticipated.
       The Director advised that, since the last session of the Confer­
    ence, additional studies of the experiences of personnel in travel
    status had been made and it was clearly indicated that, because of
    the constant increase in the costs of personal services (hotel ac­
    commodations, meals, etc.), the burden of having to absorb
    amounts necessarily expended in excess of the statutory allow­
    ances was becoming increasingly oppressive.
       It was the sense of the Conference that the increase in costs of
    all "items of expense" normally incident to travel since the present
    statutory allowances were fixed, was sufficient justification for a
    reasonable increase in these allowances at this time; and that it
    was inequitable and unreasonable to require personnel while in
    an official travel status to assume a burdensome "out-of-pocket"
    loss in providing for their ordinary maintenance.
       Whereupon the Conference took the following action:
       Expense Allowance-Judges traveling on official business.-Rec­
    ommended prompt enactment of legislation providing for an ex­
    pense allowance in an amount not to exceed $15.00 per day for
    judges in an official "travel status" incident to the performance of
    their official duties.
       Expense Allowance-Personnel of the Courts, other than
    Judges.-Recommended the prompt enactment of legislation pro­
    viding for an increase in the present subsistence allowance ($6.00
    per day) to either $8.00 per day or to an amount equal to that
    which may be granted to employees of the Executive Branch of
                                 24 


the government. It authorized and directed the Director to pro­
ceed in this respect in whatever manner may appear to him to be
the most advisable.
                                                                         fl...
  Mileage Allowance-For use of Privately Owned Automobiles
while traveling on official business.-Recommended the prompt
enactment of legislation providing for an increase in the present
mileage allowance (5 cents per mile) to either 7 cents per mile, or
a rate per mile equal to that which may be established in the
Executive Branch of the government. It authorized and directed
the Director to proceed in this respect in whatever manner may
appear to him to be the most advisable.
                THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM

  Chief Judge John J. Parker, Chairman of the Committee on the
Court Reporting System, presented the report of the Committee.
  General Increase in Salaries of Reporters.-The Committee ad­
vised that, since its last report to the Conference (September 1947),
hearings had been held with representatives of several court re­
porter organizations. With respect to the present salary and tran­
script-rate structures, the Committee stated it had made a full and
complete review of the basis upon which these structures were orig­
inally established. The Conference was reminded that when these
salaries and transcript rates were originally fixed, the following
factors were taken into consideration:
        1. The position is not a full-time job, but reporters were to
     be allowed to do outside work.
        2. The salaries fixed should have reasonable relation to the
     salaries paid state reporters in the same territory.
        3. The salaries should have reasonable relation to the time
     spent in court.
       4. Account should be taken of the importance of having a
     competent reporter available when needed and the salary
     should be sufficient to attract such service.
        5. Account should be taken of the fact that the reporter was
     given a regular income and a monopoly of the reporting of the
     court;
and the salaries of the reporters were fixed within the limits of the
Congressional authorization at the following figures:
        $3,000 per year, for rural districts where the reporter would
     be required to spend less than half his time in court.
        $3,600 per year, for rural districts where the reporter would
     be req uired to spend half his time or more in court.
        $4,000 per year, for urban districts where the reporter, while
                                     25 


-        spending half his time or more in court, is able to do substan­
         tial outside work.
            $4,500 per year, for reporters ill cities of medium size where
         the position is practically a full-time job and the reporter can
         do little outside work.
            $5,000 per year, for reporters ill large metropolitan cities,
         where the cost of living is high and where the reporters can do
         practically no outside work.
       The Committee concluded that the foregoing classification was
    fair and reasonable and that the salaries for the classification were
    liberal when fixed, and were made so in view of the low transcript
    rates established. It was of the opinion that present conditions
    do not warrant a general increase in salaries when regard is had
    for the time actually spent in court, corresponding state salaries,
    earnings from charges for transcript, and other matters which
    should be given weight in any proper consideration of the problem.
       Salary Increases in Specific Districts.-The Committee's analysis
    of the job content, the working conditions and the earnings of all
    of the reporters, and its study of all of the requests for salary
    increases brought before it, demonstrated that the following
    changes in classification and salary were warranted:
            District of Puerto Rico.-Increase in the salary of the re­
          porter from $4,000 to $4,300.
            District of the Virgin Islands.-Increase in the salary of the
          th~ reporter who also serves as secretary to the judge from
          $3,600 to $4,000.
             Northern District of Alabama.-Increase in the salaries of
          the two authorized reporters from $3,600 to $4,000.
             Northern District of Texas.-Increase in the salaries of the
          three authorized reporters from $3,600 to $4,000.
             Western District of Wisconsin.-Increase in the salary of
          the reporter from $3,000 to $3,600.
             District of Kansas.-Increase in the salary of the reporter
          from $3,600 to $4,000.
             Eastern District of Oklahoma.-Increase in the salary of
          the authorized reporter from $3,600 to $4,000.
             Northern, Eastern and Western Districts of Oklahoma.­
          Increase in the salary of the reporter who serves the judge
          for all three districts from $3,600 to $4,000.
       The Conference agreed with the Committee's conclusions and
     authorized the foregoing salary increases effective as soon as the
     state of the appropriations for the court reporting system will
     permit. The Director was instructed to seek the necessary appro­
     priations from the Congress at the first favorable opportunity.
                                   26 


   Transcript Rates.-The Committee recommended that because~             "',' ',.
of the increase in typing costs, the cost of supplies, and the general
high level of prices, the district judges should give' consideration
to the justification of an increase in transcript rates in their several
districts; that the Conference give approval, if the district judge
so determines, to an increase in transcript rates, to be made with
due consideration of the rate prevailing in state courts, provided.
that the rate shall in no case exceed 55 cents per page for original,
and 25 cents per page for copy, of ordinary transcript; and, 90
cents per page for original and 30 cents per page for copy of daily
transcript, and further provided, that the charge for daily or other
expedited transcript shall be fixed by agreement of the parties
subject to the approval of the judges, and, in lengthy cases, it
should be fixed after the conclusion of the case with progress pay­
ments to the reporter, or deposits ordered by the court. Such
transcript rate increases would become effective upon action by
the district court and certification of the new rates to the Director
without further submission to the Conference.
   Statistical data, prepared by the Administrative Office, concern­
ing the earnings of the reporters, their attendance in court, and the
transcripts they prepared, were submitted for the consideration of ~
the Conference.
   The Conference concurred in the Committee's view that a gen­
eral increase in the prevailing salary levels of the reporters was
not justified at this time. It adopted the recommendations of the
Committee in respect of an increase in transcript rates, and ap­
proved such increases being made, within the limits prescribed,
upon compliance with the procedure outlined.
  Changes in Court Reporting Arrangements.-Because of changes
in the circumstances and conditions upon which the previous
recommendations of the Committee, and action by the Conference,
were predicated, the Committee recommended the following re­
vision of the presently authorized official court reporting service
for the:
        Middle District of Georgia.-A new alternative position of
     reporter to act in that capacity alone at $3,600, if the judge
     of the district should find that preferable to the position pres­
     ently authorized for a reporter who acts also as secretary to the
     judge at $5,000.                                                       ­
        Southern District of Mississippi.-A new alternative posi­
     tion of reporter to act in that capacity alone at $3,600, if the
     judge of the district should find that this will serve the re­
                                     27 

        porting needs of his district better than the position presently
        authorized for a reporter who acts also as secretary to the
        judge at $5,000.
           Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri.-The position
        of secretary-reporter at $3,500 to be abolished, and a new posi­
        tion of reporter acting in that capacity alone at $4,500 to be
        authorized to serve the judgeship now held under Presidential
        interim appointment by Judge Harper, and to become effective
        as soon as appointment to that judgeship has been confirmed
        by the Senate; in the meantime, the reporting needs of the
        judgeship to be provided by appointment of temporary
        reporters at the rate of $4,500 per annum.
            District of I daho.-A new alternative position of reporter
        to act in that capacity alone at $3,600, if the judge of the dis­
         trict should find that preferable to the position presently
        authorized for a reporter who acts also as law clerk and secre­
         tary to the judge at 35,000.
            District of Hawaii.-Two reporters each to receive a salary
         of $4,500.
            Western District of Oklalwma.-A new position of reporter
         at $3,600 to serve Judge Chandler, in addition to the single
         position presently authorized for the district.      .
       The Conference adopted the Committee's recommendations.

        Outside Reporting Work.-The Conference was in accord with
     the opinion of the Committee that the question as to the extent
     to which official reporters should be permitted to engage in outside
     reporting work was ordinarily one to be determined by the partic­
     ular courts concerned.
        Reports to the Administrative O!fice.-Upon the Committee's
     recommendation, the Conference instructed the Director to inform
     the reporters that all earnings from reporting work of every kind
     should be included in their quarterly reports to the Administrative
     Office, and that, in reporting private earnings, income received from
     reporting arrangements through private partnerships or corpora­
     tions, or from the employment by them of other reporters for out­
     side reporting assignments, should be included; further, that CDn­
     solidated reports of earnings in districts where there are more than
     one reporter should be used only when there is an actual pooling of
     earnings, in which case the percentage of earnings allocated to each
     reporter should be indicated.
\        The quarterly reports are of importance to the Conference and
"i   its Committee, and it is essential that they be filed with the Admin­
      istrative Office promptly in accordance with the instructions for
      their use, and that they be carefully and accurately compiled.

                  BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

   Chief Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Conference Com­
mittee on Bankruptcy Administration, submitted the report of the
Committee.
   General.-A resume of the first year of operation under the
Referees' Salary System showed that there were 48 full-time, 112
part-time referee positions, and 133 full-time and 82 part-time
clerical positions, authorized and filled during the year. The por­
tion of monies received from the assessment of fees and charges
during the year ear-marked for deposit in the referees' salary and
expense funds, exceeded the amount expended from these funds
in the amount of $36,313, denoting a healthful financial condition,
and a self-sustaining basis, for the system. Case filings during
the year totaled 18,510 cases as compared with 13,170 cases in
1947, and 10,196 in 1946. Estimates submitted by the Administra­
tive Office indicated a continuation of the increase trend in filings,
and for the year 1949 26,000 cases were expected to be filed, with
32,000 filings in 1950. Reports concerning the dispatch of the
Referees' business were most satisfactory, and reflected a high level
of efficiency in its management.
   Changes in the number of referees, territories, salaries, places of
holding court, regular place of office.-Pursuant to § 37b (1) of
the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, and directions of the Judicial
Conference of the United States, the Director, during the past year,
conducted resurveys in districts wherein such action was deemed
expedient.
   The original surveys which covered the 1O-and-5-year periods
ending June 30,1946, were extended to the date of the resurvey and
took into account the number, size and type of pending cases re­
referred to the referees upon the inauguration of the salary system;
the number, size and character of new cases referred to the referees
since July 1, 1947; the deposits in each district in the referees'
salary and expense funds; the time necessarily spent by the referees
in handling the cases referred to them; the time necessarily re­
quired in traveling to and from designated places of holding hear­
ings; the proportion and character of cases arising away from the
headquarters of the referees, and the number of large asset and
arrangement cases handled by them. Each district in which
changes were recommended was visited by the Chief of the Bank­
ruptcy Division whoeonferred with the referees, the district judges
                                                                         -.
and others interested in bankruptcy matters. Consideration was
                                  29 


also given to the salaries presently provided in other districts to
the end that the increases recommended would not create dispar­
ities in comparable districts.
   The information thus assembled was sent to the district judges
and the circuit councils concerned. It was also considered by the
Committee on Bankruptcy Administration, and the Conference
had before it all of this data, together with such recommendations
of the district judges and the circuit councils as had been received
at the time of the Conference meeting. The recommendations of
the Director and the Committee were considered separately in the
light of the foregoing information along with any special factors
affecting each case. Also, the Conference had before it additional
data compiled as of the close of the fiscal year ending June 30,1948,
and in some instances through July and August, 1948.
   The Conference thereupon took the following action:
      District:

    full-time referees at Los Angeles.
   Dismissed cases-Refund of filing fee-Opinions of Administra­
tive Office concerning collection of additional and special charges.­
The Committee recommended, and the Conference adopted, the
                                                                        ­
following resolution:
                                 31
                              RESOLUTION

        Resolved, It is the sense of the Conference that no part of
     the filing fee of $45.00 paid upon the filing of a bankruptcy
    proceeding is refundable upon the subsequent dismissal of the
     proceedings, and that opinions rendered by the Administra­
     tive Office relating to the collection of additional and special
     charges for the referees' salary and expense funds in dismissed
     cases should be distributed to all referees and clerks of courts
     for their information.
  Charges in straight Bankruptcy and arrangement cases under
Chapter XI administered without reference to Referees.-The
Committee recommended the adoption of the following regulation:
        Additional charges for the referees' salary and expense funds
     promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States
     pursuant to Section 40c(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, as
     amended, shall be collected for such funds in all straight bank­
     ruptcy and arrangement cases under Chapter XI administered
     before a district court without reference to a referee in
     bankruptcy.
  It was pointed out that such charges should be made in order
that the costs of administration may be uniform and to provide the
funds necessary to maintain the referees' salary and expense funds.
  The Conference concurred in the Committee's views and recom­
mendation, and directed that the foregoing regulation be promul­
gated immediately.
  Charges for Special Services relating to or in connection with pro­
ceedings before Referees.-The Conference adopted the following
resolution:
                              RESOLUTION

      Be it resolved, That Paragraph No.1 of the Charges for
    Special Services relating to or in connection with proceedings
    before referees, promulgated pursuant to Section 40c(3) of
    the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, be amended to read as
    follows:
       "1. For the preparation and mailing of each set of notices
    in asset cases and in cases filed under the relief chapters of
    the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, in excess of 30 notices per
    set, 10 cents for each additional notice on the first 10,000,
    5 cents per notice on the next 10,000 and 3 cents per notice
    on the balance, provided, That in no proceeding adminis­
    tered in straight bankruptcy shall the total charge for the
    referees' expense fund for special services exceed 25 percent
    of the net proceeds realized."
                                32
                        Legislative Proposals
    The Conference renewed its recommendation that Sec. 57j of
the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, be amended so as to stop the
running of interest and penalties on tax claims at the time of the
filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and directed that efforts be
made to secure the necessary legislative action to so provide.

  The Conference renewed its recommendation that Sec. 58d of
the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, be amended so that the publi­
cation of the notice of the first meeting of creditors shall be dis­
cretionary, the same as provided for the publication of other
notices.
   The Committee proposed that Sec. 62b (1) of the Bankruptcy
Act, as amended, be amended so that the referees will either re­
ceive a reasonable per diem allowance in lieu of subsistence while
traveling in the performance of their official duties, or they be
allowed their actual expenses, not exceeding $8.00 per day, payable
upon their certificate. In this connection, it was pointed out that
under existing regulations of the Comptroller General, all items
of expense in excess of $1.00 must be supported by a signed receipt,
                                                                       0.'
and that this requirement has proved to be extremely burdensome
to the referees, and, in many instances, because of the absence of
these receipts, has resulted in a disallowance of their expenses. It
was stated also that due to present-day costs the established maxi­
mum allowance of $7.00 per day is inadequate and a reasonable
increase in the allowance is justified.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee's proposal, and di­
rected that efforts be made to secure the legislative action neces­
sary to bring about the changes desired.
              Miscellaneous Administrative Matters
  The Committee recommended that, in the interest of economy,
hereafter only Bankruptcy Statistical Tables Nos. F-la, F-2, F-4,
F-5, and F-12 be incorporated in the annual report of the
Director.
  The Conference approved the Committee's recommendation.

  It was the sense of the Conference that, upon the expiration of
the terms of referees, the approval of the Conference required by
                                                                       -

Sec. 43b of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, for the making of
new appointments could be sought by mail.
                                 33 

  Pursuant to the provisions of Section 37b (1) of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, as amended, the Director was authorized to conduct
any resurveys which, in his opinion, were warranted during the
ensuing year.

WAYS AND MEANS OF ECONOMY IN THE OPERATION OF THE FEDERAL
                              CoURTS

   The report of the Committee on Ways and Means of Economy
in the Operation of the Federal Courts was submitted by its Chair­
man, Chief Judge John J. Parker.
   In February of this year, the Committee met and formulated a
report of its progress concerning the activities and objectives of
the Committee for the information of the various circuit councils
and conferences, and to provide a suggested program of specific
problems for the consideration of the committees appointed to
undertake the study of possible operating economies in the several
circuits.
   Following the circulation of this report, committees on economy
were appointed in all the circuits; reports covering the results of
their efforts were submitted to, and made a matter of discussion
by, their respective circuit conferences. Reports received from
the circuit conferences indicated that an exhaustive and intensive
study had been made and, as a result thereof, considerable im­
provemen t had already been achieved.
   In order to coordinate and digest the views of the circuit con­
ferences, a second meeting of the Committee was held in August.
At this time the Committee, based upon analyses of the informa­
tion, suggestions and recommendations received, determined, with
respect to the following subject matters, that:
   Elimination of Places of Holding Court.-It was clear that court
is now required to be held in many places where such a service is
entirely unnecessary. Although, in many instances, the situation
has been recognized by the judges and remedial action recom­
mended, the complete solution can be obtained only through leg­
islative measures. In this connection, it is preferable to secure the
enactment of general legislation, under which the district judges
will be enabled to deal with these situations by rule of court, rather
 than to endeavor to secure independent legislation as individual
cases arise.
   It was the view of some of the district judges that the whole of
 this subject matter was one that should be left to their sole dis­
 cretion. However, the Committee felt that the circuit judges com­



                                                                         1
                                   34 

posing the judicial councils have responsibility as well as the dis­
trict judges for the proper administration of justice within the
district and should logically have a voice in the matter; and, that
the requirement necessitating approval of the judicial council, be­
fore any change is made by rule of court (in what is now required
by statute) would afford a broader point of view in the considera­
tion of these problems.
   The Committee recommended that Section 138 of the Revised
,Judicial Code (Title 28 U. S. Code 138) be amended to read as
follows:
         § 138. Times, places and divisions for holding court subject
      to rule.
         (a) The times for holding regular terms of court at the
      places fixed by this chapter shall be determined by rule of the
      district court.
         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 81 to 131,
     both inclusive, of this title, divisions of districts and places for
     holding regular terms of district court may be changed or abol­
      ished by rule of the district court upon a finding that the pub­
      Hc interest so requires and approval by the judicial council of
     the circuit.
   The Committee also recommended that, pending the enactment
of this legislation, consideration be given by the district judges and
the judicial councils to the exercise of the powers and discretion
                                                                            o
vested in them under §§ 138, 140 (a), and § 141 of the Revised
Judicial Code. It was the opinion of the Committee, that these
provisions provide a framework for substantial reductions in ex­
penses, and that their use to accomplish such economies, consistent
with the proper and efficient dispatch of the court business, is
warranted.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee's suggestions and
recommendations, and directed that efforts be made as promptly
as possible to secure the enactment of the proposed amendment to
 § 138 of Title 28 of the United States Code.
    Discontinuance of Unnecessary Clerks' Offices.-There are nu­
merous branch offices of the clerks of the courts that are superflu­
 ous, and considerable savings could be obtained immediately
through the diseontinuance of those offices falling within this cate­
gory.
    The Committee urged that the district judges make a careful
 survey of existing conditions in their respective districts, and where
 such situation is found to prevail necessary corrective measures be
 promptly instituted. It was pointed out that ample power for such
                                  35 

action is vested in the district judges under § 751 of the Revised
Judicial Code.
   Consolidation of Districts within States.-A general discussion
was had with respect of the Committee's views concerning the pos­
sible economies in operation and increase in management efficiency
that may eventually be obtained through the consolidation of dis­
tricts lying within a single st.ate. It was agreed that there were
some multiple-district states in which such consolidations would
not be desirable. Whereupon, the Conference adopted the follow­
ing resolution:
                               RESOLUTION

       Be it resolved, That, henceforth, the Judicial Conference of
    the United States will definitely oppose the creation of any
    additional judicial district; and, where it. is found that. addi­
    tional judicial service is necessary, it will recommend that such
    service be provided by the creation of additional judgeships
    within the t.hen existing judicial districts.
   Number of Sessions of Court Where Judge is not Resident.­
There was general approval of the suggestion that, since the holding
of court in divisions where no judge has his official residence entails
many items of expense, each judge serving one of such outlying
divisions should appraise carefully the docket for the division and
endeavor to administer the business of the court with the least
possible number of sessions.
   Economies in Jury Administration.-Jury pools should be used
in cities where two or more judges are sitting simultaneously, and
in multiple-judge courts efforts should be made to synchronize the
t.imes when jury trials are held by t.he various judges so that. as
efficient. use as possible can be made of jury pools.
   Through the elimination of unnecessary sessions of court in out­
lying divisions, and restricting the size of jury panels so that they
are no larger than the business of the session requires, a substan­
tial saving could be made in the cost of jurors.
   A more widespread employment of the practice of requiring each
prospective juror to answer a questionnaire for the purpose of de­
termining, before he is summoned to court, whether he possesses
the required qualifications, would result in considerable savings in
time and money for both the individual and the government..
   The Committ.ee urged that. t.he district judges consider the adop­
tion of a policy of selecting as jurors only those otherwise qualified
persons who reside within a reasonable distance of the place where
                                  36 

the court sits in conformity with the provisions of Title 28 U. S.
Code § 1865 (a).
   The Committee recommended that the Chief Judge of each
circuit appoint a committee to investigate the use of jurors in the
various district courts within the circuit, and to make recommenda­
tions to increase the efficiency of that use and for the improve­
ment of the administration of the jury system.
   The Committee proposed that a survey be undertaken by the
Administrative Office with respect to the use of jurors in courts
of the metropolitan areas for the purpose of furnishing information
to the Conference with regard to particular ways and means of pro­
moting efficiency and economy in jury administration in those
courts.
   Pretrial Procedure.-The Committee urged the continued con­
sideration and study of the use of pretrial methods by those judges
who have not already adopted such a program, and the broadening
of their use by those judges who have. It emphasized the fact that
10 years of experience in the federal courts has demonstrated be­
yond peradventure that pretrial procedures result not only in great­
er efficiency in the judicial processes, but in great economies in time
and money for the courts, the litigants, and the public.
   In this connection, attention was called to the value of the re­
lated provisions of Rules 26-36 of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro­
                                                                          o
cedure dealing with depositions and discovery, and of Rule 56 pro­
viding for summary judgments, and the promotion of their use by
the district judges was urged.
   Economies in the Clerks' Offices.-The expense incident to the
maintenance and operation of these offices represents a substantial
portion of the over-all costs of operating the courts. These of­
fices are the most important business office of the courts-the nuclei
of their record-keeping and service functions-and, because of
these duties, the prompt and orderly dispatch of the court's busi­
ness is, to a considerable extent, contingent upon the degree of
efficiency maintained in the management of such offices. Due to
 these factors alone, it is highly desirable that the most efficient
 office methods be adopted and advantage taken of all feasible means
 of saving labor.
    The Committee reviewed the improvements in methods and
procedures which resulted through studies and surveys conducted
by the Administrative Office since it was organized in 1939. While
these results have been most gratifying, the Committee was of the
opinion that there was room for much further improvement, but
                                     37 

    it could be fully realized only through the adoption of a program
    providing for constant supervision and study of operating proce­
    dures and methods. It was the sense of the Committee that the
    field was a highly specialized one and, because of everchanging
    conditions, the continuous effort to improve office techniques and
    equipment, and the magnitude of the volume of detail and work
    incident to studies of this nature, such a program demanded the
    full time and attention of experts in the field.
       The Committee recommended the appointment of an additional
    member to the staff of the Administrative Office to be charged with
    the duty of conducting a continuous study of the processes used
    in handling the business matters of the courts, and bringing about
    their improvement.
       The Committee also recommended that the Administrative Of­
    fice conduct a survey of some representative clerks' offices, with
    the approval of the judges of the courts concerned, and with such
    assistance from the Bureau of the Budget, or elsewhere, as may
    seem advisable, and report back to the Conference any recommen­
    dations which in its opinion may be generally applicable.
       Sending up Original Papers on Appeals.-The Committee urged
    that those courts of appeals which have not already done so, give
    serious consideration to the adoption of a local rule that will make
     operative subdivision (0) of Rule 75 of the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure, as added by recent amendments to the rules, to provide
     for the transmission to the courts of appeals of original papers for
    hearing of the appeals. In addition, the Committee also urged
    consideration of the adoption of the "appendix" rule. It was stated
     that the experiences of those circuits in which these practices were
    followed, clearly demonstrated that substantial savings in labor,
     time, and expense to the courts and the parties resulted from their
     use.
        The Conference thereupon approved those suggestions and rec­
     ommendations of the Committee hereinabove set forth which it
     had not already specifically adopted. It directed that the report of
     the committee, as amended, be adopted and approved; and, as
     amended, be sent to all judges with the request that they give their
     earnest and serious consideration to the matters contained therein.
        Service of Process-Costs.-The attention of the Conference was

-    directed to the statement of the Attorney General in respect of the
     excessive costs that were being incurred in many instances inci­
     dental to the service of process in civil cases on parties located at
     a considerable distance from the United States MarshaL It was
                                 38 

the consensus of the Conference that, in situations of this type, im­
portant savings in both time and costs could be realized through
a more regular and widespread use of the "special appointment"
provisions under Rule 4 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce­
dure. The Conference urged that district judges give this matter
their immediate attention. It directed the Director to cooperate
with the Department of Justice in working out a suitable procedure
for bringing this to the attention of those charged with the admin­
istrative responsibility for such services.
   Supreme Court Digests.-The Director advised that additional
publications of digests of the opinions of the Supreme Court of
the United States were becoming available and, in some few in­
stances, requests therefor had been received. It was the sense of
the Conference that inasmuch as all judges were presently being
furnished with a current and up-to-date digest of these opinions,
the furnishing of additional digests which covered the same field
was not justified.
                          STATUS REPORT
        LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS PREVIOUSLY RECOMMENDED

   Concerning the Adequacy of Existing Provisions for the Protec­
tion of the Rights of Indigent Litigants in the Federal Courts.-        0
The report of the Conference Committee was presented by Judge
Otto Kerner. The Committee met on ~ay 4, 1948 to consider
the questions in reference to the legislation previously recom­
mended, which were referred to it by the Judicial Conference in
1946; namely, whether provisions should be included to make
available to indigent defendants in criminal cases in the courts
of appeals the services of the public defender or of counsel ap­
pointed in the particular cases in the trial courts, and also to fur­
nish counsel for indigent persons applying for habeas corpus.
   The committee readily agreed that counsel appointed to repre­
sent poor persons in criminal proceedings in trial courts on com­
pensation, should continue to represent them and to receive
compensation on appeal in proper cases. The committee recom­
mended a new section to be inserted in the bill following the present
section 3 as section 4, and the renumbering of the present sections
4 and 5 as 5 and 6 respectively. The new section 4 recommended is
as follows:
        SEc.4. In any criminal cases in which an indigent defendant     .•',"
     is represented in the district court by a public defender or by
                                       39 

          counsel appointed by the court in the particular case, the
          public defender or such counsel as the case may be, shall also
          represent him in the event of appeal in the appeal proceedings
          if either the district court or the court having jurisdiction
          of the appeal shall consider that there is reasonable ground
          for appeal and shall so direct. Services of the nature specified
          in this section if rendered by a public defender shall be part
          of his duties and performed without other compensation than
          his salary. If such services are rendered by counsel appointed
          in the particular case, such counsel may in the discretion of
          the court directing the representation on the appeal, be com­
          pensated in the measure specified in section 3 of this act for
          counsel appointed to represent indigent defendants in crimi­
          nal cases and be reimbursed for their expenses. Any sums so
          paid for compensation and expenses of services on appeal shall
          be included in the maximum limit of $3,000 in any fiscal year
          imposed by section 3 of this act upon the aggregate expendi­
          tures for the defense of indigent defendants in the respective
          districts from which the appeals are taken.
       The Conference adopted the Committee's recommendation.
       The Committee stated that careful thought had been given to
     the proposal that provision should also be made in the bill for the
     payment of compensation to counsel appointed to represent poor
     persons petitioning for habeas corpus, and had concluded that it
     may not be advisable at this time to introduce such provision into
     the present measure which is designed to secure adequate represen­
     tation for indigent defendants.
        The Conference concurred in the conclusions of the Committee.
       The Committee reported that it had considered again the feature
     of the bill that in districts containing cities of over 500,000 inhabi­
     tants, if there is to be any system of compensating counsel for poor
     defendants in criminal cases, it must be by the appointment of
     public defenders, and had concluded that they should adhere to
     their original recommendation as is encompassed in the present
     provisions of the bill.
        After a general discussion of the Committee's position, the
     Conference concluded that, in those districts having cities of over
     500,000 population, the representation of poor persons in criminal
     proceedings might be by counsel appointed and compensated in
     the individual cases where the district court so recommends and
     the circuit council approves, and directed that the proposed bill be
     so amended.

-
    Sentencing and Parole of Youthful Offenders-The Federal
     Youth Authority.-Chief Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the
                                 40 

Committee on Punishment for Crime, advi3ed that a bill to provide
for a Federal Youth Authority, in accordance with the recom­            ~
                                                                        '~,
mendations of the Judicial Conference in 1946, was introduced
in both Houses of the present Congress early in the session in
slightly different forms. The bill in the House (ll. R. 1680) left
blank the provision for the appointment of two members of the
Authority other than the Director of the Bureau of Prisons. The
bill as introduced in the Senate (S. 857) provided that the two
members mentioned should be appointed-one by the Supreme
Court of the United States, and one by the President with the
advice and consent of the Senate. Salaries of each of the members
were fixed at $9,000 per annum under both bills.
   The Conference reaffirmed its interest in the prompt enactment
of legislation establishing a correctional system for youthful of­
fenders convicted in the courts of the United States along the lines
previously recommended. It was of the view that the method of
appointment of the members of the Authority, other than the
Director of the Bureau of Prisons, should be by the President with
the advice and consent of the Senate; and that, in order to provide
salaries at levels equal to those prevalent in other similar agencies
of the government, the salaries of the members should be at the
rate of $10,000 per annum.
   The Conference directed that the Congress be again informed
                                                                        o

of its deep interest and feeling in this proposal in the hope that
favorable action thereon may be had in the immediate future.
  Review of Orders of Certain Administrative Agencies.-The re­
port of the Committee on Review of Orders of the Interstate Com­
merce Commission and certain other Administrative agencies sub­
mitted by its Chairman, Chief Judge Ode L. Phillips, was ordered
received and filed.
  Interstate Commerce Commission and the United States ~~lari­
time Commission.-It was the opinion of the Conference that Sec­
tion 8, as amended by the report of the Judiciary Committee of the
House of Representatives (Report No. 1619) of H. R. 1468, 80th
Congress, 2d Session, and Section 10 thereof fully protect the
rights of the Commissions. The Conference, thereupon, recom­
mended that the bill be passed, as amended and reported by the
Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.
  Federal Communications Commission and certain orders of the
Secretary of Agriculture made under the Packers and Stockyards
Act, and the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act.-It was the
opinion of the Conference that Sec. 8, as amended by the report of
                                     41 


-   the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives (Report
    No. 1620) of H. R. 1470, 80th Congress, 2d Session, and Sec. 10
    thereof fully protect the rights of the Commission and the Secre­
    tary. The Conference, thereupon, recommended that the bill be
    passed, as amended and reported by the Committee on the Judi­
    ciary of the House of Representatives.
      The Federal Jury SY8tem.-District Judge Harry E. Watkins, of
    West Virginia, a member of the Committee appointed to make a
    study of the federal jury system, reported to the Conference con­
    cerning the status of legislation relating to certain changes in the
    federal jury system which had been proposed pursuant to recom­
    mendations of the Conference. It was stated that the recommen­
    dations pertaining to increases in compensation and allowances for
    jurors had been enacted into law, and the Committee was favorably
    impressed with the prospects for obtaining necessary action cover­
    ing the remainder of the program within the immediate future.
      The Conference thereupon reaffirmed its approval and recom­
    mendations heretofore given to that portion of the legislative meas­
    ures previously proposed which remain un enacted, as well as the
    repeal of subsection (4), § 1861 of Title 28, United States Code, if
    such action was deemed necessary.
      Treatment of In8ane Per80n8 Charged with Crime in the FederaZ
    Court8.-The Conference reaffirmed its interest in legislation pro­
    viding for a method of treatment, care, and custody of insane per­
    sons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States,
    and approved the bill which passed the Senate (S. 850) on June 10,
    1948.
                        OTHER COMMITTEE REPORTS

       Codification and Revi8ion of the Judicial Code.-Judge Maris,
    Chairman of the Committee on Codification and Revision of the
    Judicial Code, submitted the final report of the Committee. The
    report stated that, under Public Law 773 of the 80th Congress,
    2nd Session (approved by the President June 25, 1948), Title 28
    of the United States Code, entitled "Judicial Code and Judiciary,"
    is revised, codified, and enacted into positive law, thus completing
    the task for which the Committee was originally created.
       The Conference extended a vote of appreciation to the Commit­
    tee for its untiring efforts and its accomplishments.
       The Conference ordered the Committee continued for the pur­
    poseof considering matters of clarification, the correction of errors,
    and such other matters which may be specifically referred to it by
    the Conference.
