          ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS

   Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts.I-The Director submitted his tenth annual report
reviewing the activities of his office for the fiscal year ended June
                                                                                              c
30,1949, including the report of the Division of Procedural Studies
and Statistics. The Conference ordered the report received, and
authorized its immediate release for publication. The Director
was authorized to incorporate statistical data not now available,
and to correct errors of a nonsubstantive nature in the printed edi­
tion of the report to be issued later.
   State of the dockets of the Federal courts-Courts of appeals.­
The number of cases commenced in the courts of appeals in the
fiscal year 1949 increased 8 percent from 1948 in a continuation of
an upward trend which began last year following an almost unin­
terrupted decline since 1940. The rise in appeals was greatest in
the District of Columbia where the number of new cases rose from
348 to 463. The Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Cir­
cuits each had over 10 percent more cases commenced in 1949 than


                                                                                              -
  1 For convenience, the Director of the Administrative Olllee of the United States Courts,
and the AdministratiVe Olllee of the United States Courts, are hereinafter referred to as
the Director, nnd the Administrative Olllee, respeetively.

    in 1948. The number of cases filed in all circuits was 2,989.
    About one-sixth of those were appeals from administrative agen­
    cies. . Administrative appeals increased because 172 cases were
    appealed from the National Labor Relations Board in 1949 as
    compared with 63 in 1948. There were 233 appeals from The Tax
    Court of the United States and 86 other administrative appeals,
    approximately the same total as last year.
       Cases terminated were 2,753, or 236 less than the number filed
    with a resulting rise in cases pending at the end of the year to
    1,909, the heaviest pending caseload since the creation of the cir­
    cuit courts of appeals.
       Petitions to the Supreme Court for review on certiorari to the
    United States courts of appeals were 630 compared with 597 in
    1948. Seventeen percent of petitions acted upon were granted
    compared with 13 percent last year. Forty-two percent of the
    petitions for review of administrative appeals were granted (16
    out of 38); 22 percent of the petitions in civil cases in which the
    United States was a party (41 out of 190); 14 percent of the peti­
    tions in criminal cases (13 out of 93) and 12 percent in private
    civil cases (34 out of 292).
       The median time from the filing of the complete record in the
    courts of appeals to final disposition of contested appeals was 7.1
    months compared with 6.3 months during the previous year, but
    12 percent more cases were decided. This increased time was the
    result of a longer period from docketing to the date of argument.
    The median from hearing to decision was 1.6 months, the same
    interval as last year.
       District courts.-An increase in civil cases filed in the district
    courts from 46,725 in the fiscal year 1948 to 53,421 in 1949 was
    principally the result of the increase in govetnment rent cases
    commenced by the Office of the Housing Expediter. Private civil
    cases, which are more time consuming for the courts than govern­
    ment cases, rose about 3.4 percent. Civil cases disposed of were
    less than the number commenced with the result that at the end
    of the year there were 5,025 more cases pending than at the begin­
    ning. The 54,240 civil cases remaining on the dockets on June
    30,1949, constituted the largest pending caseload since 1933. For
    the past 10 years the number of civil cases commenced and termi­
     nated annually and the number pending at the end of each fiscal
                                        4
year with separate figures for all civil cases and private civil cases
were as follows:

   The peak of OPA price control and rationing cases was reached
in 1946 and dropped sharply in the two succeeding years. Private
civil cases have shown a tremendous increase since the war and
the number commenced in 1949 was almost half again as large as
the number in 1940. The increase in cases pending at the end
of the year is a result of docket congestion in a few places and a
heavier civil case load than last year in 9 out of 10 district courts.
Private cases based on the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction of
the Federal courts have shown a steady increase since the war.
                                                                                                c
Both contract and tort actions in this group are much greater
in number than before the war. Diversity cases in 1949 amounted
to almost one-fourth of the total civil cases filed. About one-
third of these diversity cases were commenced in the state courts
and removed to the Federal courts.
   A great increase since the wa·r has also taken place in private
admiralty suits, while admiralty suits brought against the govern­
ment have decreased sharply during the same period. Tax suits
continued to increase in 1949 but were still not so numerous as in
1941. The Federal Tort Claims Act which went into effect 3
years ago has produced a substantial amount of litigation but the
number of actions commenced against the United States under
this statute in 1949 was somewhat less than in the previous year,
 declining from 1,503 to 1,249. Employers' Liability Act cases,
 involving injuries to railroad employees, after increasing steadily
 from 100 cases in 1941 to 1,038 in 1948, decreased to 944 in 1949.
Three-quarters of the cases filed in the year just passed were com­                             ~
menced in 10 districts.
                                      5

       Civil cases were not disposed of so promptly as last year by the
    district courts. The median time interval from filing to disposi­
    tion of civil actions terminated after trial in 86 districts having
    purely Federal jurisdiction was 10.4 months in 1949 compared
    with 9.9 months in 1948 while the median time from issue to trial
    was 5.9 months compared with 5.8 months.
       The number of criminal cases commenced in all districts was
    34,432 or 2,335 more than last year. The principal factor in the
    increase was violation of the immigration laws. These cases, in­
    volving illegal entry into the United States, now amount to almost
    30 percent of total criminal proceedings. Almost all of them are
    brought in the districts adjacent to the Mexican border. There
    were also increases in cases involving fraud and theft, and for vio­
    lations of the liquor tax laws while juvenile delinquency cases were
    fewer and charges of violation of OPA laws almost disappeared.
    Cases terminated exceeded the number begun and on June 30,
    1949, there were less than 6,000 criminal cases pending which were
     available for disposition. In some 2,000 other cases fugitive de­
    fendants were involved. The criminal dockets are in excellent
    shape and prompt disposition of these cases is the rule.
       The number of bankruptcies continues to grow. The lowest
    point during recent years in bankruptcy cases commenced was in
    1946 when only 10,196 cases were filed. A steady increase since
    then has multiplied the 1946 figures 2¥2 times to the 26,021 cases
    filed in 1949. A large rise in pending cases has also occurred by
    reason of terminations falling below the number commenced, and
    as of June 30, 1949, the pending figure had reached 30,539.
                           ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

      General.-The Conference reviewed the state of the dockets, and
    the work of each of the district courts and courts of appeals compris­
    ing the Federal judiciary. Conditions relating to the courts within
    each particular circuit were discussed by the Chief Judge of that cir­
    cuit, and the Conference informed of matters peculiar to such courts.
    Statistical data relating to the current and prospective business of
    the courts were presented by the Director. The attention of the
    Conference was also directed to factors which, because of their
    character, were impossible to weigh in these data, but which had a
-   material and substantial effect upon the dispatch of the courts'
    business. The prospects as to the availability of judges for assign­
         860592-49-2
                                6

ments outside their own districts during the coming year were
considered.
  It was the sense of the Conference that the following action with
respect to judgeships throughout the judiciary should be
recommended:
                             DISTRICT
       Delaware.-The existing temporary judgeship in this dis­
    trict be made permanent.                        .
       Western Pennsylvania.-The existing temporary judgeship
    in this district be made permanent.
         Eastern, middle, and western Pennsylvania.-That the Act
    (approved July 24, 1946, 60 Stat. 654) creating a district
    judgeship for these districts be amended so as to provide that
    the present incumbent shall succeed to the first vacancy oc­
    curring in the position of district judgeship for the Middle
    District of Pennsylvania, and that, thereafter, the judgeship
    created by that Act for the Eastern, Middle, and Western
    Districts of Pennsylvania shall not be filled.
        Eastern Texas.-The creation of one additional district
    judgeship.
        Northern Ohio.-The creation of one additional district
     judgeship.
        Northern and southern Indiana.-The creation of one dis­
     trict judgeship for service in both districts.
        Northern Illinois.-The creation of two additional district
     judgeships.
        Eastern and western Missouri.-The existing temporary
     judgeship in this district be made permanent.
        Territory of Alaska-Third Division.-The creation of one
     additional judgeship.
  The Director was instructed to present these recommendations
to the Congress and to urge the prompt enactment of legislation
necessary to carry them out.
              SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS

   Chief Judge Biggs, Chairman of the Committee on Supporting
 Personnel of the United States Courts, presented the report of the
 Committee:
   Salaries-National Park Commissioners.-The report of the
 Committee, made pursuant to the directions of the Conference,
                                                                      ­
                                  7

covering a study of the problems involved in fixing the salaries of
National Park Commissioners was ordered received as information
and filed. The Director was instructed to communicate with the
various district judges having employees of this type within their
jurisdiction and bring to their attention the provisions of § 634 of
Title 28 of the U. S. Code, with the request that they promptly
submit recommendations with respect to the salaries that should
be paid such employees.
   Law clerks and secretaries-Annual and sick leave.-The Con­
ference was advised that under the rulings of the Comptroller Gen­
eral of the United States it is necessary, in order for these employees
to be eligible to receive lump sum payments for their accumulated
annual leave, that proper records showing the number of hours
worked, the amount of leave earned, the amount of leave taken,
etc., be maintained on a current basis. It was the view of the
Committee that because of the variant and peculiar circumstances
incident to employment of this type, it was not desirable to in­
augurate a system whereby rigid hours must be adhered to, but, if
these employees are to receive such benefits, compliance with the
rulings of the Comptroller General is a prime requisite, and, there­
fore, proper leave records, kept on a current basis, must be
maintained.
   Pursuant to the recommendations of the Committee, which were
adopted by the Conference, the Director was instructed not to
approve claims for accumulated leave benefits unless the claims
are supported by proper records, kept in the regular course of busi­
ness, and such records are produced from time to time for inspection
by the examiners of the offices of the courts.
   The Conference further directed that the Director inform the
various judges concerned that claims for lump sum payments
for future accumulations of leave will not be approved by him
where the required records are not maintained.
   Law clerks and secretaries-Civil-service Status.-The Confer­
ence reaffirmed its approval of legislation which will permit the
secretary, secretary-law clerk, or law clerk of any Federal justice
or judge who has served for 4 years and who has been separated
from the service involuntarily and without prejudice, to acquire a
classified civil-service status for transfer purposes upon passing a
noncompetitive civil-service examination.
   Additional deputy marshals for service during trials in the
District CO'!frts.-The Committee reported that in the 1950 Ap­
                                 8


propriation Act the sum allowed the Department of Justice
for the employment of temporary deputy marshals to act as bailiffs
in the district courts when needed to supplement the work of the
regular criers for the district courts was reduced from $100,000 in
1949 to $50,000 and that this amount has proven inadequate to
provide the necessary service to the courts in the conduct of their
business particularly in the busier districts.
   The Conference was of the opinion that the amount of $100,000
which has heretofore been authorized and which experience has
shown to be required if adequate service of this type is to be pro­
vided for the courts, should be restored in the proper appropriations,
and it directed that efforts be made to so provide in the appropria­
tions for the Department of Justice for the fiscal year 1951.
   General-Probable reclassifications and salary adjustments.­
The Director called the attention of the Conference to legislation
pending in the Congress under which certain reclassifications and
salary adjustments would be provided for employees under the
classified civil service, and requested that he be authorized, in the
event such legislation is enacted, to make the required readjust­
ments in classifications and salaries necessary to place the em­
ployees in the judiciary on a parallel classification and salary basis
with those in similar positions in the Executive Branch. It was
                                                                         c
stated that such action would accord with the established practice
of the Administrative Office, as well as the policy of the Conference.
  Thereupon, the Conference adopted the following resolution: 

        Resolved, That the Director of the Administrative Office of 

     the United States Courts be authorized to make changes in 

     grade classifications and necessary salary adjustments cover­

     ing personnel of the courts that may be required to place such 

     classifications and salaries on a comparable basis with those 

     established in the Executive Branch by the enactment of any 

     reclassification legislation by the Congress; such reclassifica­

     tions to be approved by the Committee on Supporting Per­ 

     sonnel of the Courts a.cting for the Conference. 

             TRAVEL AND SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCES

   Expense allowance-Judges traveling on official business.-The
Conference reaffirmed its previously stated views concerning the
necessity for increasing from $10 to $15 per day the maximum lim­
itation upon subsistence expenses incurred by judges while in an
                                                                         -
                                 9

official travel status, and urged that legislation so providing be
enacted promptly.
   Expense allowance-Personnel of the courts, other than judges,
excepting the Supreme Court.-The Director advised that subse­
quent to the last meeting of the Conference, the Congress had en­
acted the Travel Expense Act of 1949 under which provision is
made for a "per diem allowance to be prescribed by the department
or establishment concerned, not to exceed the rate of $9 per day,
within the limits of continental United States." Acting under this
authority, and pursuant to the directive of § 604 (a) (7) [and see
§ 610J of Title 28, of the United States Code which requires the
Director to "regulate and pay necessary travel and subsistence ex­
penses incurred by judges, court officers and employees of the Ad­
ministrative Office while absent from their official headquarters,"
and based upon data and information concerning travel expenses
throughout the country obtained from various sources, the Director
fixed initial rates for subsistence of personnel of the courts, other
than judges, excepting the Supreme Court, as follows:
         (1) For travel not involving overnight absence from head­
      quarters and so avoiding expense for lodging, $6 a day.
         (2) For travel involving overnight absence and lodging ex­
      pense except in specified locations, mainly large cities, where
      the cost of transient accommodations was considered to be at
      the maximum of $9 allowed by the statute, $8 a day.
         (3) For travel involving lodging in the excepted locations,
      $9 a day.
    The Director stated that some question had been raised con­
 cerning his authority to regulate the expense allowances for the
employees of the Court of Claims. It was his view that the
 statutes were clear in this respect and that under their provisions
 he was not only authorized, but required to "regulate and pay
 necessary travel and subsistence expenses * * *" of these
 employees.
    The Conference was of the opinion that the employees of the
 Court of Claims fall within the purview of the statute, and that
 the Director's interpretation thereof was correct. It thereupon
a.pproved the Director's action in fixing the initial rates for sub­
 sistence of the personnel of the courts concerned.
    Mileage allowance-For use of privately owned automobiles
 while traveling on official business.-The Director advised that
 under the Travel Expense Act of 1949 the mileage allowance for
                                            10 


the authorized use of privately owned automobiles on official busi·                            ~
ness had been increased to seven cents per mile, which was in ac-                              """"
cord with the recommendations of the Conference.
                      THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM

   The Director submitted a report together with recommendations
concerning the Court Reporter System.
   In view of the recently created judgeships, and in line with its
policy standards, the Conference authorized the immediate estab­
lishment of the following new court reporter positions at salaries
indicated:

                                                                 Number of          Salary

  Salary increases in specific districts.-A review of the job con­
tent, working conditions, and the earnings in those districts in
which salary increases had been requested was had. The Confer­
ence authorized the following increases in salary of the reporters
concerned, effective as soon as the state of the appropriations for
the Court Reporting System will permit:
                                        DISTRICT

       Maine.--Salary of the reporter, who also serves as secre­
     tary to the judge, from $4,000 to $5,000 per annum.
       Vermont.--Salary of the reporter, who also serves as clerk
     in the probation office, from $4,000 to $4,500 per annum.
  Changes in court reporting arrangements.-In view of the
changes in circumstapces and conditions upon which previous rec­
ommendations of the Committee on the court reporting system,
and action by the Conference, were predicated, the following re-                               ­
visions in the presently authorized official court reporting services
were ordered:

              Nebraska.-A new alternative position of court reporter­
              secretary at a salary of $5,000 per annum, if the judge of the
              district should find this arrangement preferable to the present
              position authorized for a court reporter serving solely in such
              capacity at Omaha at $4,000 per annum.
                Texas (western) .-A new position of court reporter to serve
              solely in this capacity at a salary of $4,000 per annum, in lieu
              of the previously authorized court-reporter-Iaw clerk position
              at a salary of $5,000 per annum. This action to constitute
              formal ratification of the informal approval previously given
              by the Conference for the creation of this position.

                            BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

             The Chief Justice advised that, pursuant to the authority vested
          in him by the Conference he had, under date of September 16,
          1949, reconstituted the Conference Committee on Bankruptcy Ad­
          ministration, in order that the Conference may have the benefit
          and views of a Committee of the Conference on the recommenda­
-..       tions of the Administrative Office in reference to arrangements for
.~        referees. The Committee on Bankruptcy Administration, as recon­
          stituted, is composed of the following members:
                   Chief Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman. 

                   Circuit judges: John B. Sanborn and F. Ryan Duffy. 

                   District judges: H. Church Ford, Seybourn H. Lynne, Claude 

                 McColloch, Alfred C. Coxe, and Albert V. Bryan.
              Chief Judge Phillips, chairman of the reconstituted Committee
          on Bankruptcy Administration, stated that, pursuant to the request
          of the Chief Justice, a special meeting of the Committee was re­
          cently held for the purpose of considering the report prepared by
           the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office, and sub­
           mitted by the Director with his approval for Conference considera­
           tion. The report recommended certain changes in the number and
          salaries of referees, and other changes in referee arrangements, based
           upon conclusions drawn from studies and surveys conducted by
           the Administrative Office throughout the year. The recommenda­
           tions, except in some few instances, had not been submitted to the
 -         various district judges concerned, nor to the respective circuit coun­
.......    cils, for their consideration and recommendations. It was the view
           of the Committee that, before any action upon the proposals could
                                                        12 

be taken by it, or by the Conference, the provisions of the statutes
required that the whole subject matter be passed upon by the vari·
ous judges and councils of the circuits concerned.
   The Conference agreed with the views of the Committee, and
directed that the report of the Bankruptcy Division of the Admin­
istrative Office be submitted to the judges of the various districts
involved with the request that they make known their recommenda·
tions to their respective circuit councils promptly; and, that the
circuit councils be requested to act expeditiously upon such recom·
mendations in order that the Committee and the Conference may
have the benefit of their views so that action upon the proposals
may be taken at an adjourned meeting of the Conference to be held
in November.
   The district judges, the respective circuit councils, and the Direc­
tor having submitted recommendations, the Committee, upon con­
sideration of the data submitted with respect to the case load, the
kind and size of cases filed, the material and substantial changes in
business conditions, and other relevant factors, recommended that
the following new referee positions, at the salaries indicated, be
authorized immediately:

   The Conference adopted the Committee's recommendations, and
directed that these referee positions be established, effective im·
mediately, at the salaries indicated above.
   Pursuant to the Committee's Recommendations, the Conference
authorized the following changes in operating arrangements, effec­
tive immediately:

                                    13 

      Legislative proposals.-The Conference renewed its previous rec,­

-   ommendations that § 58d of the Bankruptcy .Act, as amended, be
    amended to provide that the publicati<m of the notice of the ~rst
    meeting of creditors shall bediscretionary,.the same as provided for
    the publication of other notices.
                MISCELLANEOUS ADMINISTRATIVE MATI'ERS

       Court records-Maintenance and keeping of.-The Director ad­
    vised that the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District
    of N ew York has requested authorization for the installation of the
    system of microfilming records similar t.o the system which was
    recently authorized and installed in the District Court for the
    District of Columbia, and where it has proven so satisfactory. The
    Chief Judge of the District Court concerned, as well as the Chief
    Judge of the Circuit, have approved of the request, and are anxious
    far the change to be made at the first opportunity.
       The Director submitted a form of directive which he prop.osed
    to issue authorizing the change, and pointed out that action by
    the Conference in the way of its approval was required under rule
    79 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Rule 55 of the
    Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
       The Conference approved of the directive proposed to be issued
    by the Director, and authorized the prompt installation of the
    microfilming method of preserving certain records in the United
    States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
        Quarters for the courts-Available space in existing Federal
     structures, and future building programs.-The Commissioner of
     Public Buildings, Public Buildings Administration, Hon. W. E.
     Reynolds, presented a report relating to the space situation in
     existing government structures throughout the country that are
     under his supervision and control. It was indicated that the build­
     ing programs had been materially curtailed because of the war
     and subsequent reconstruction programs,and, as a result of this
     B,nd the magnitude with which the activities of the government in
    general have expanded, space is not only at a premium,but pre­
     sents· an almost insolvable problem. He stated that the. Federal
     courts rated the highest.of priorities in their space allocation pro­
     gram, and that iheirneeds wottld continue to be of the utmost
     interest to tl).e Public Buildings-Administration., . . .       ' ..

Federal court quarters in Federal buildings hereafter to be con­
structed" which had been prepared in connection with a "study of
the needs and requirements of the Courts" made in conjunction
with the Committee of the Conference on Postwar Building Plans
for the Quarters of the United States Courts, which was submitted
to the Conference at its Annual Meeting in October 1946. In all
of their contemplated programs, the question of proper and ade­
quate space and facilities for the courts was being given their
earnest consideration. And, inasmuch as there had been no major
Federal building program authorized since 1938, it was hoped, be­
cause of the extreme need for new and enlarged facilities, that
proper authority for such a program would be forthcoming in the
not too far distant future.
   Commissioner Reynolds expressed his appreciation for the gra­
cious and courteous manner in which he had always been received
by the members of the Federal judiciary and of the Administrative
Office, and for the sympathetic interest shown in the consideration
of his problems.
   The Assistant Postmaster General, Hon. Walter Myers, pre­
sented a report concerning existing space available in the Federal
buildings under the supervision and control of the Post Office De­
partment. He stated that conditions similar to those confronting      c
the Public Buildings Administration prevailed in that Depart­
ment. The space situation was tight generally-not only in the
government, but outside as well. Because of the expansions ne­
cessitated by the greatly increased volume of their own business,
the substantial broadening of the services which the Department
has been called upon to render, and the required housing of activ­
ities other than those originally contemplated, the Department is
"hard-put" to solve its own space problems. Mr. Myers assured
the Conference of the Department's continued cooperation and
effort to render the judiciary every possible assistance. He ex­
pressed his thanks and that of the Department's representatives
for the considerate and understanding manner with which they,
and their space problems, had always been received by the
judiciary.
   The Conference expressed its appreciation of the efforts of the
Public Buildings Administration and the Post Office Department
to render efficient and courteous service, and to provide adequate
and proper quarters, and recorded its thanks to Commissioner          -

      Budget and dejiciencyappropriationestimates.-.The estimates
    of expenditures and appropriations n~cessary for the maintenance
    and operation of the United States Courts, and the Administrative
    Office of the United States Courts, for the fiscal year 1950 were
    considered by the Conference. Certain revisions in the estimates
    covering the operation of the referees' salary and expense funds
    were ordered made by the' Conference. The estimates as so
    amended were then approved by the Conference. .                .
       After consideration, the Conference approved the estimates for
    deficiency appropriations for the fiscal year 1950..

                       OTHER. COMMITT&E REPORTS

       Three-judge district (expediting) court.-The report of the
    Committee appointed to "make study concerning the proposal to
    eliminate or modifythe provisions for/itthree-judge district (ex­
    pediting) court iIi antitrust cases as presently provided for under
    Title 15 U. S. Code § 28," was sUbmitted by Chief Judge Calvert
    Magruder, Chairman of the Coffimittee.
       Pursuant to its policy, the Conference directed that the report
    be circulated throughout the judiciary in order that the views and
    suggestions of the various judges may. be ascertained, and that a
    further report covering the subject matter be submitted to the
    Conference by the Committee.'                                .


      Pretrial procedure.-The report ofthe Committee on pretrial
    procedure was presented and discussed by Circuit Judge Alfred P.
    Murrah, Chairman of the Committee. A resume of the work of
    the Committee was had and indicated considerable headway had
    been made in bringing about a broadening of the use of pretrial
    procedural methods. Judge Murrah stated that the Committee
    was much encouraged and felt that with the program contemplated
    for the immediate future substantial improvements could be
    anticipated.
      The Conference ordered the report of the Committee received
    and filed, and that the work of the Committee, as well as its pro­

-   posed program and recommendations, be approved. TheConfer­
    ence directed that copies of the report be sent to all judges as infor­
    mation with the request that they continue their cooperation with
                                 16 

the Committee in its work, and that the suggestions and recom­
mendations of the Committee, which are those of the Conference
by adoption, be given their earnest consideration.


   Judicialstatistics.-The report of the Committee on Judicial
Statistics was presented and discussed by Circuit Judge Charles
E. Clark, Chairman of the Committee. Judge Clark stated that
considerable progress had been made in the various Committee
projects, and that the Committee was favorably impressed and
quite pleased with the interest and cooperation evidenced by the
whole of the judiciary in the Committee's undertakings. The
Conference ordered the report of the Committee received and ap­
proved, and directed that copies of the report be sent to all judges
for their information and consideration.
   Statutory definition of felony.-The Committee of the Confer­
ence appointed to consider the proposal, approved by the Judicial
Conference of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, that lltitle 18 U. S. Code
541 (Old Code) be amended so as to make the definition of (felony'
depend upon the punishment actually inflicted, rather than the
punishment which could lawfully be imposed" submitted a written
report to the Conference.
   The Committee expressed the view that, because of the limited
interest expressed with respect to the subject matter under consid­
eration, no further useful service is to be rendered by it in the
premIses.
   The Conference ordered the Committee discharged, and the
subject matter stricken from the Conference agenda.
   Revision of criminal and judicial codes.-Circuit Judge Albert
 B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on the Revision of the
 Criminal and Judicial Codes presented the report of the
 Committee.
    During the past year, a bill to correct all errors and ambiguities
 which had come to the attention of the Committee was enacted
into law (Pub. Law 72, 81st Cong. app'd May 24, 1949). The
 Committee renewed its recommendations concerning the desira­
 bility of changing the procedures involved under present statutory
 requirements in respect of the promulgation of rules of civil and
 criminal procedure adopted by the Supreme Court of the United
 States.
    It appeared to the Committee that further amendments to
                                                                         -
 § 1446 (b), title 28 of the U. S. Code, which relates to the time for
                                    17 



-
    filing a petition for removal of a case from a State court to the
    Federal District Court, as amended by § 83 (a) of the Act of May
    24, 1949, may be necessary in order to better meet the procedural
    provisions of some States. It was the view of the Committee that,
    in order to determine whether such an amendment is actually
    needed, further studies of the procedures of several states covering
    the commencement of civil actions, and the manner in which
    amended § 1446 (b) of Title 28 operates in practice should be had.
       The Committee recommended that an appropriate committee
    of the Conference be authorized to make such studies and submit
    its recommendations for changes, if any, found to be needed in
    § 1446 (b) of Title 28, as well as any other amendments of that
    title, or Title 18, which may be needed to correct errors or am­
    biguities which may hereafter be discovered.
       The Conference ordered that the report of the Committee be re­
    ceived and approved; it reaffirmed its previous recommendations
    with respect to suggested changes in existing statutory provisions
    concerning procedures covering the reporting and promulgation of
    rules of Civil and Criminal procedure adopted by the Supreme
    Court of the United States. The Conference directed that the
    present Committee of the Conference on the Revision of the Crimi­
    naland Judicial Codes be continued for the purposes recommended
    by the Committee.

      Treatment of imane persons charged with crime in the F ederaZ
    courts.-Chief Judge Magruder, Chairman of the Conference Com­
    mittee on the treatment of insane persons charged with crime in
    the Federal courts, advised that legislation had recently been en­
    acted covering the subject matter, and, therefore, the Committee
    should be discharged.
      The Conference extended its thanks to the members of the Com­
    mittee for their efforts in this instance, and ordered the Committee
    discharged.
                 LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE JUDICIARY
                     LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS APPROVED

      Picketing of the courts.-The report of the Committee appointed
    to make a study of the practice of picketing the courts and to make
    recommendations to the Conference with respect to action to be
    taken thereon was submitted by its Chairman, Circuit Judge
    F. Ryan Duffy,
       It was stated that Senate bill 1681, as amended, and reported
                                 18 

favorably in the Senate (Report No. 732, 81st Cong., 1st sess~) on
July 20, is the result of joint House and Senate JUdiciary Commit­
tee hearings on two companion bills S. 1681 and H. R. 3766; there is
also now pending in the Senate H. R. 5647, which was reported
favorably by the House Judiciary Committee, and passed the JIouse
under unanimous consent by voice vote on August 26,1949. Each
of these measures deal with the subject matter.
   As a result of the Committee's consideration, it is clear that the
sentiment of the bar associations and individual lawyers has been
and is practically unanimous in favor of some legislation in regard
to the subject matter. On February 1, 1949, the House of Dele­
gates of the American Bar Association by resolution condemned
picketing of courts as an interference with the orderly administra­
tion of justice; and, many local and State bar associations have
taken similar action. Several of the circuit judicial conferences
have either specifically endorsed the pending measures, or have
endorsed them in principle. The few judges expressing opposition
to the proposals were either of the opinion that proceedings in
contempt were adequate to cope with such situations, or they were
resentful of the idea that a judge could be influenced by picketing
demonstrations. In connection with the latter viewpoint, the com­
mittee unanimously agreed with the statement made by its Chair­
man when he appeared before the Joint Congressional committee
in expressing his individual, personal viewpoint: "I have no doubt
that a judge's decision or action could not be so influenced. But
the judge is not the entire court. I am apprehensive that jurors
and witnesses might well be influenced by such intimidating out­
side pressure. I think the Ellender bill (Senate bill 1681) will
provide the proper insulation."
   In conclusion, the committee expressed the opinion, substan­
tiated by a great preponderance of the sentiment of judges who
have expressed their views and of the bar of this country, that the
enactment into law of either H. R. 5647 or S. 1681 is desirable.
   The Conference entered upon consideration of the provisions of
H. R. 5647 and S. 1681, after which, upon motion made and
adopted, the Conference approved S. 1681, as amended, and re­
ported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and recom­
mended its prompt enactment.

  Circuit judicial conferences-Attendance of district judges.­
The recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Judi­
                                    19 

    cial Circuit that the present provisions of § 333 of title 28, U. S.
    Code, be amended so that the judges of the United States District
    Ctmrt of Hawaii and the District Court of the Territory of Alaska
    would be authorized and directed to attend the annual meetings of
    that Conference, was discussed by Chief Judge Denman. It was
    stated that, insofar as the judges of the United States District
    Court of Hawaii were concerned, a bill (H. R. 4579) had been intro­
    duced covering the subject matter.
       The Conference was of the opinion that it was highly desirable
    to have.in attendance at the respective Circuit Judicial Conference
    concerned not only the judges of the United States District Courts
    located outside the continental United States in Hawaii and Puerto
    Rico, but also the judges of the District Courts for the Territory
    of Alaska and the Virgin Islands, and the United States District
    Court for· the Canal Zone. It thereupon directed that the neces­
    sary amendments to § 333 of title 28, U. S. Code to so provide be
    submitted to the Congress .vith the request that they be promptly
    enacted.
       United States Court of Claims-Legu,lation affecting.-Hon.

-   Marvin Jones, Chief Judge, and Hon. Joseph W. Madden, Judge,
    of the United States Court of Claims appeared before the Con­
    ference for the purpose of discussing the provisions of legislation
     (R. R. 5301) which has been introduced in the House of Repre-,
    sentatives by Congressman Celler providing for the reconstitution
    of the Court of Claims, and redefining its jurisdiction. Subsequent
    to the presentations by Judge Jones and Judge Madden, the con­
    ference entered upon a general discussion of the proposal and
    adopted certain amendments to the bill as submitted. The Con­
    ference thereuPQnapproved the bill CH. R. 5301) as amended by
    the Conference.
       Courts-Du,trict of Columbia-Conflict of Jurisdiction, District
    Court of the United States and the Municipal Court.-Circuit
    Judge E. Barrett Prettyman, and Chief Judge Laws of the United
    States District Court for the District of Columbia, discussed
    the proposal, recommended by the Judicial Conference of the Dis­
    trict of Columbia Circuit, to amend Section 4 of the Act of Con­
    gressapproved April 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 192 (Sec. 11-755, Supp. VI,
    D. C. Code 1940 Ed.) by adding the following addItional proviso:
            Provid(3d, further, That upon a showing in the Municipal
         Court forthe District of Columbia that a claim there pending
         arises out of a transaction or occurrence that is the subject

     matter of an action pending in the United States District              ~
                                                                            . '...'
     Court for the District of Columbia and is one which would              ~
     constitute a compulsory counterclaim therein except for its
     pendency in the Municipal Court, the Municipal Court for the
     District of Columbia shall certify the same to said United
     States District Court, together with a copy of the docket en­
     tries and any orders theretofore entered and the deposit for
     costs, for interposition as a counterclaim in the action pending
     therein.
   It was stated that under the provisions of Rule 13 (a), as
amended, of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is ex­
cepted as a compulsory counterclaim in the District Court a claim
which is already the subject of a pending action in the Municipal
Court; and the Municipal Court of Appeals has ruled that the
Municipal Court has no jurisdiction to entertain as a counterclaim
an action over which the District Court has jurisdiction. Thus,
it would appear, that adverse claims growing out of the same oc­
currence are required to be adjudicated in separate actions in sep­
arate tribunals, and the decision in the case tried first is res jUdicata
of the other, if the matter in defense in the former is the same as
the claim in the latter. In view of the fact that under the provi­          ~
sions of the Act of April 1, 1942 (56 Stat. 192), the District Court
has jurisdiction concurrent with the Municipal Court over counter­
claims in actions over which the District Court has jurisdiction,
the existing defect will be removed by the enactment of the pro­
posed amendment.
   The Conference approved of the proposed amendment to Section
4 of the Act of Congress approved April 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 192 (Sec.
 11-755, Supp. VI, D. C. Code 1940 edition) as submitted, and rec­
 ommended its prompt enactment by the Congress.
                 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS DISAPPROVED

  Administrative Court of the United States.-Chief Judge Hutch­
eson, Chairman of the Committee designated to make study and
recommendations relating to the bill (Sen. 684) introduced in the
Congress "to improve the administration of justice by the creation
of an Administrative Court of the United States" presented the
report of the Committee.                                                      ..... 

  The Committee stated that all of the eleven circuit conferences,
excepting the Sixth and Ninth Circuits, upon full discussion and
consideration of the proposals, had adopted resolutions disapprov­
    ing not merely the terms of the bilI but the general theory and
    policy of the proposal for an administrative court, and recommend­
    ing against its creation. It was pointed out that. while the form
    of the resolutions adopted varied, in substance each conference
    took the same action, and that the following minute adopted by
    the Circuit Conference for the First Judicial Circuit adequately
    su:mma.rizes the views not only of that circuit, but also of the other
    circuits:
            The judicial conference of the judges of the First Circuit
         recommends that Senate bill 684, providing for the creation
         of an Administrative Court of the United States, be
         disapproved.
            The functions which the regular courts now exercise in
         judicial review of agency action are appropriate functions for
         courts of general jurisdiction; that is, determination of the
         constitutionality of the statutes under which the administra­
         tive agencies act, interpretation of the statutes to determine
         whether the agencies have acted within their statutory au­
         thority, determination of whether the agencies have accorded

-        due process of law, determination of whether there is sub­
         stantial evidence to support the administrative findings of
         fact and whether the ultimate conclusions reached by the
         agencies are rationally derived from such findings. In ap­
         parent recognition that the foregoing functions are appro­
         priate for courts of general jurisdiction, it is noted that S.
         684 does not withdraw the existing jurisdiction of Federal
         district courts and courts of appeal, but merely adds another
          court with optional, overlapping jurisdiction which may be
         invoked at the instance of a party other than an agency. In
         addition, the bill provides that on request of the Administra­
         tive Court, any active or retired judge of the United States
         may, with his consent, be assigned by the Chief Judge of his
         court or the Chief Justice of the United States, to duty as a.
          judge of the Administrative Court for a temporary period. It
         is further noted that appellate jurisdiction over the proposed
         Administrative Court is conferred upon the Supreme Court
         on certiorari, so that, as at present, the ultimate power of de­
          termination in this· class of cases is conferred upon a court of
          general jurisdiction.
             We believe that the bill, in setting up another specialized
          judicial tribunal, takes an undesirable and unnecessary step
                                 22
    in the direction of further disintegration of the Federal judi. .
    ~~a                                                                 ,

  The Committee also stated that,although no formal conference
action was taken by the Sixth and Ninth Circuits, the Judges of
those circuits have, with substantial unanimity, expressed similar
views.
   It was emphasized that the official statistics as to the number
of appeals annually from administrative orders in all the circuits
conclusively demonstrates the utter lack of neceSsity for such a
court.
   On the basis of the views and opinions gathered from the judges,
members of the bar, and other pertinent sources, the Committee
concluded that the passage of Senate bill 684, as originally pro­
posed or as amended, is not only unnecessary but in its implications
and consequences would be positively harmful.
   In accordance with the recommendations of the Committee,
which were adopted and approved, the Conference ordered that its
disapproval of the proposals of Senate bill No. 684 to create an Ad­
ministrative Court be recorded and the Congress advised of this
action.

   Sound recording of court proceedings.-The report of the Com­
mittee appointed to make a study of legislation that had been
proposed (H. R. 3475) "to provide'ior the recording of proceedings
in one of the courtrooms of the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia by sound-recording equipment; and for
the reproduction of the sounds of such proceedings in whole or in
part in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia * * *" was presented by its Chairman, Chief Judge
Bolitha J. Laws. The Committee was unanimous in its opposi­
tion to the provisions of the bill as drawn. However, it did not
oppose such tests and experiments being conducted on a volun­
tary basis by the courts mentioned, provided it was accomplished
administratively, and not by legislation. The committee indi­
catedthat as a result of its explorations, it was probable that the
necessary tests .could be obtained on an administrative hasis within
the courts concerned, and without cost to the government.
   The Conference thereupon ordered that its disapproval of the
legislation proposed by H. R. 3475 be recorded; but, that it ap­         .­
 proves the installation of a sound-recording device in the United
                                      23 

     States District Court for the District of Columbia for experimental
     and test purposes only.
        Transfer of proceedings-Disqualification of judges.-The Con­
     ference considered the provisions of H. R. 2722, introduced in the
     House of Representatives on February 15, 1949, by Congressman
     Emanuel Celler "to amend section 144, of title 28, United States
     Code, with respect to the procedure for transfer of proceedings
     before United States district court judges by reason of bias or
     prejudice."
        The Conference ordered that its disapproval of the bill, H. R.
     2722, be recorded.
             LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS PREVIOUSLY RECOMMENDED

        Punishment for crime-youthful offenders-The Federal Youth
     Authority.-Chief Judge Orie L. Phillips, Ohairman, Subeom­
     mittee on Youth Offenders of the Committee on Punishment for
     Crime, advised that legislation to establish a Youth Correction
     Authority in conformity with the recommendations of the Con­
     ference was introduced in the Eighty-first Congress in both the
-    House of Representatives (H. R. 1780) and the Senate (S. 1114).
wi      In the course of the Senate study of the bill, certain difficulties
     were pointed out which it was feared would develop in the adminis­
     tration of the system if the legislation should be enacted in the
     form presented. Accordingly, representatives of the committee
     met with the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, the American Law
     Institute's Special Advisor on its Youth Authority program, Mr.
     John Ellingston, and a member of the staff of the Judiciary Com­
     mittee of the Senate, for the purpose of considering these difficul­
     ties and endeavoring to devise ways and means of overcoming them.
        After considerable thought and consideration, the conferees ten­
     tatively agreed that the present bill should be amended to embody
     the following ideas:
              (1) The administrative functions; that is the classification,
           allocation, treatment and correctional functions, should be
           vested in the Bureau of Prisons, and the functions of the Youth
           Correction Agency should relate primarily to orders of dis­
           charge, both conditional and unconditional, and the revoca­
           tion or modification of conditional releases; but that the
           agency should be empowered to consider problems of treat­
           ment and correction and to counsel with and make recom­
           mendations to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons with
           respect thereto.
                                    .24 


           (2) The' Youth Correction Board should become, a p&rt
      of the regular Parole Board, which should be reorganized by
      enlarging it from five to eight members, all of whom are to be
      appointed by the President with Senatorial confirmation, and
       whose chairman is to be designated by the Attorney Gener~l.
      The Attorney General shoul,d be empowered to assign mem­
      bersof this enlarged Parole Board, as· they are needed, to a
      separately established "Youth Correction Division," within
      the Parole Board which will devote its, full attention to the
       administration of the Youth Correction Act.
           (3) The district judges should be given the additional
      power to request that youthful offenders to whom the system
       could be applied be sent, for study and analysis, to one of the
       classification centers to be established under the Act, and then
       returned to the court for sentencing in the light of this study.
           (4) The district judges should be empowered in their dis­
       cretion to specify a term of treatment under the Act in excess
       of the term which the Act fixes for youth offenders otherwise
       committed to the Youth Correction Division. In such in­
       stances, the term so specified must be for a term not greater
       than the maximum specified by the statute for the offense of
       which the offender was committed.
           (5) The members of the Youth Correction Division should
       be required, as soon as practicable after commitment to it,
       to interview each defendant personally in order that the Divi­
       sion may have first-hand information concerning him and be
       thusenahled to give thorough individual treatment to each
       offender under its supervision.
            (6) There should be established an unpaid Advisory Cor;..
       rection Council composed of representatives of the judiciary
       and of the various correctional agencies to advise in the CQ­
       ordination and improvement of the administration of criminal
       justice for all classes of offenders after conviction.
    It was the view of the Committee that the suggested changes
would overcome the administrative difficulties presented and c1ar':'
ify the areas of responsibility for the administration of the system;
that it would give to the system a greater elasticity, to be used in
the discretion of the judges, and, at the same time, retain the fun':'
damentalpurposes and objectives of the Conference .

            of Justice and the Congressional Committees in perfecting
            details of the legislation ultimately to be enacted.
          The Conference approved and adopted the recommendations of
       the Committee.
          The Federal jury 8ystem.-District Judge Harry E. Watkins,
       of West Virginia, a member of the Committee appointed to make
       a study of the Federal jury system, reported to the Conference
       concerning the status of legislation relating to certain changes in
       the Federal jury system which had been proposed pursuant to
       recommendations of the Conference.
          Allowances for jurors.-A bill further increasing the compensa­
       tion for jurors was recently enacted into law. Under the provi­
       sions thereof, jurors will now receive a per diem of $7 per day,
       and a subsistence allowance of $5 per day in those cases where it
       is necessary for them to remain away from home over night. In
       addition, they will receive a travel allowance of 7 cents per mile­
       this covers all travel without limitation.
          The bills relating to uniform qualifications of jurors in the Fed­


-
       eral courts (H. R. 2051) and the bill (H. R. 2050) to provide for
       a jury commission remain pending in the Congress. In this con­
       nection, it was stated that another bill (H. R. 3207) had been in­
       troduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Ram­
       say which related to the subject matter covered by both H. R. 2051
       and H. R. 2050. The provisions of this bill differed very materially
       and substantially from those, and was not in accord with the views
       and recommendations of the Conference.
          The Committee recommended that H. R. 2050 as presently
       drawn be amended with respect to the compensation of the jury
       commissioner so that it will provide that each jury commissioner
       shall receive $5 per day for each day necessarily employed in the
       performance of his duties. It was stated that such an amendment
       would be in conformity with the existing compensation allowances
       under § 1864 of title 28, U. S. Code, and that the fixed daily rate,
        without limitation, was preferable to the allowances set forth in
       H. R. 2050.
          The Conference recommended that H. R. 2050 as presently
       drawn be amended to accord with the Committee's recommenda­
       tions. It reaffirmed its previous approval of the legislation pro­
       posed by H. R. 2050, as amended, and H. R. 2051, and ordered
...­   that its disapproval of the legislation proposed in H. R. 3207 be
       recorded.
                                  26 


   Legislative proposals reaffirmed.-The Conference reaffirmed its
previous recommendations regarding proposed legislation relating
to the following:
                                                                           ,
         (1) The removal of civil disabilities of probationers ful­
     filling the terms of their probation.
         (2) Providing for proper representation in Federal Courts
     for the protection of the rights of indigent litigants.
                            COMMITTEES

   Committees continued and discharged.-All present Committees
of the Conference were ordered continued with the exception of
the following which were ordered to be discharged:
          Committee on the treatment of insane persons charged with
      crime in the Federal courts.
          Committee on the statutory definition of felony,
   New committees.-The Conference was of the opinion that ex­
perience has indicated the desirability of examining the present
procedure governing controversies arising under the antitrust laws
and the various statutes establishing regulatory agencies with a
view to advancing their effective, expeditious and economic dispo­
sition, and authorized the designation of a Committee ofthe Con­
ference to consider:
          (1) means whereby the proceedings of regUlatory agencies
       may be shaped both to satisfy the needs of the parties and to
       facilitate the reviewing function of the courts;
          (2) means whereby at nisi prius particular evidence may be
       explicitly related to defined issues and all of the evidence on a
       particular issue presented together;
          (3) means whereby (a) the materials in the record are con­
       fined to the issues under review by preparation of the record
       after points for argument have been exchanged between the
       parties and by any other means devised for delimiting such,
       and (b) such materials are marshalled in a form most helpful
       for their consideration;
          (4) and all other modes by which the general ends herein
       indicated may be achieved.
The Committee to report to the Conference the results of its con­
 sideration and recommendations promptly upon completion of
 its study.
    Pursuant to such authorization, the Chief Justice designated the
 following as a Committee of the Conference for the purposes
 indicated:
                                                                           ­

    N. Hand and Walter C. Lindley, and District Judges W. Calvin
    Chestnut, Frank L. Kloeb, Paul C. Leahy, Simon H. Rifkind and
    Leon R. Yankwich.
    Committees General.-The Conference authorized the Chief
    Justice to take whatever action he deemed desirable with respect
    to increasing the membership of existing committees, the reconsti­
    tuting of discharged committees, the filling of any existing com­
    mittee vacancies, the appointing of new committees, and the
    designation of membership in such instances.
     Advisory Committe e.-The Conference continued the committee
     consisting of the Chief Justice, and Chief Judges Stephens, Biggs,
     Parker and Phillips, to advise and assist the Director in the per­
     formance of his duties.
       The Conference declared a recess, subject to the call of the Chief
     Justice.

                                  APPENDIX
    REPORT OF THE ATl'ORNEY GENERAL, HON.             J.   HOWARD MCGRATH

          .Mr. 	 Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference of the
                 United States, Honored Guests:
              Last year in his report to this Conference, Attorney General
          Clark stated that he considered the work of the Judicial Confer­
          ence of the United States one of the most important single elements
          in the administration of justice in the Federal courts. I agree
          wholeheartedly with the view expressed by Attorney General Clark.
          During my tenure of office as Solicitor General of the United States,
          I came to realize and appreciate the truly great contribution which
          this Conference· makes toward the improvement of the Federal
           judicial system. The detailed and tedious work done by your com­
          mittees, your willingness to examine and reexamine your own rules
          and procedures, and your ever-present spirit of cooperation with
           the executive and legislative branches of the Government have re­
           sulted in steady progress toward achieving a speedy, efficient, sim­
           ple, inexpensive, and fair system of Federal justice. It is most
          gratifying to me that one of my first functions as Attorney General
          is the privilege of appearing here, in a similar spirit of mutual co­
          operation, and playing a part in your work for the constant and
          steady improvement of the judicial system of the United States.
          The responsibility for the efficient and just operation of our Federal
          judicial system is a responsibility which the Department of Justice
          shares with this Conference-and we consider our share of that
          responsibility as one of our most important functions.
              A judicial system is not to be judged by court decisions alone.
           Ahnost equally as important as the ultimate decision in a case are
           the methods and procedures required in order to obtain that de­
           cision. Oftentimes the expenses and delays of litigation deprive
           the prevailing party of the fruits of his victory. A good judicial
          system must enable a litigant to enforce his rights as quickly and
          as economically as possible. In order to achieve this goal two
          things are essential-an adequate number of qualified judges to
          cope with the ever expanding work of the courts, and an increased
....... 
 use   of improved procedures designed to simplify and shorten liti­
           gation and thereby make it less expensive.
                                        (20J
                                 30 


   A great step forward was accomplished last month when the Con­
gress enacted and the President approved Public Law 205 which ,
authorized increases in the number of circuit and district judges,
substantially as recommended by this Conference. The enactment
of this legislation constitutes recognition on the part of the execu­
tive and legislative branches of the Government of the importance
of the work of the Federal judiciary during this great and important
period of history, and, indeed, is tangible evidence of the sincere
appreciation of the other two branches of the Government for the
great effort made by the Federal judges under the strain of an
almost impossible work load and under the most trying circum­
stances. I am sure that the President will continue, as he has done
in the past, to endeavor to fill the new vacancies, as well as others
as they occur, as rapidly as possible, consistent with his established
policy of appointing only the most qualified to judicial office. I
hope that never again shall we have the unpleasant experience of
reading in a report of the Director of the Administrative Office of
the high incidence throughout the country of disability of Federal
judges because of illnesses largely attributable to overstrain in work.
   With respect to procedures designed to make the judicial process
simpler, less complicated and more economical, the Department of     O.


Justice strongly advocates the increased use of the pretrial proce­
dure permitted by Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Our experience has demonstrated that satisfactory and effective
results have been achieved by the use of this procedure. In some
districts, however, the courts have been reluctant to recognize the
most effective methods for administering their authority under
Rule 16, and in some districts the pretrial conference is very per­
functory. A more effective use of this pretrial procedure would
assist in expediting the disposition of cases and effecting a speedier
clearance of court dockets, and would result in economies to the
courts, the litigants, and the public. I was glad to note that your
Committee on Ways and Means of Economy in the Operation of
the Federal Courts urged upon the district judges the increased use
of the pretrial procedure as well as of the provisions of the Federal
Rules dealing with depositions and discovery and summary
judgment.
   Last year Attorney General Clark called the attention of the
Conference to the great increase in litigation under the Federal
Tort Claims Act. I am glad to say that the processing of these
cases is being handled more expeditiously than it was 2 years ago.
                                                                      -

-   Weare now usually able to obtain the investigative reports from
    the agencies involved and have them in the hands of the United
    States Attorneys in time to enable the Government to answer or
    move within the 60-day period. Also, systematic procedures
    within the Government have been worked out for making available
    without delay Army, Navy, and Coast Guard personnel, as well as
    civilian employees of the Government, when they are needed as
    ",itnesses. The Department will continue in every way possible to
    process these cases so as not to clutter up the court dockets. In
    this connection, I might point out that recently there has been a
    tremendous increase in litigation involving veterans and their de­
    pendents. We foresee an even greater increase in this type of
    litigation as a result of the various governmental programs relating
    to veterans. Here, too, the Department will make every effort to
    expedite and avoid delay.
       A problem with which the Department of Justice has become
    concerned has to do with the time to answer in admiralty cases.
    Rule 44 of the General Admiralty Rules authorizes the district
    courts to regulate their practice in such manner, not inconsistent
    with the Rules, as they deem most expedient for the due adminis­
    tration of justice. Pursuant to this authorization, the district
    courts have established varying local rules concerning the time to
    answer, and in some districts the time limit has been set at 15 days.
    These varying time limitations are applicable to the United States
    and its agencies. This Conference is well aware that these time
    limits are entirely too short to enable the Department of Justice
    to obtain from the agencies involved the necessary data and reports
    on the basis of which it must decide what action is to be taken. In
    most cases, the Department is required to move for an extension of
    time, and in many cases answers have to be drawn without sufficient
    study. This problem has become more acute in recent years be­
    cause of the great increase in admiralty litigation conducted by the
    Department. In cases under the Federal Rules of Civil Proce­
    dure, the Government is specifically permitted 60 days in which
    to move or answer, and it would appear that the practice in ad­
    miralty should provide a similar uniform rule for the Government.
    Perhaps a suggestion by this Conference to the district courts will
    achieve the purpose. It may be, however, that an amendment to
    the General Admiralty Rules is required. The Department of
    Justice will sincerely appreciate the assistance of this Conference
    in this regard.
                              32 

    This Conference is, of course, well aware of the approval on ... 

May 24, 1949, of Public Law 72 which brought Titles 18 and 28 """ 

of the United States Code up to date and corrected many errors
 appearing therein and removed certain ambiguities which had
been discovered. Indeed, Public Law 72 is largely the work of
your Conference Committee, and the report of the House Judiciary
Committee (H. Rep. 352, 81st Cong., p. 2) expressed the gratitude
 of the Judiciary Committee lito the members of the Judicial Con­
ference Committee for their generous devotion to this work and
 for their important contributions and assistance to the House
 Committee and its revision staff." I am sure that the members
of the bar will sHently express their gratitude to the members of
 your Committee as they have occasion from day to day to deal
 with the various sections of Titles 18 and 28. The only changes
in existing law effectuated by Public Law 72 that I wish to refer
to are those contained in sections 59, 103, and 104, which provide
that amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and
 to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be reported to the
 Congress by the Chief Justice instead of by the Attorney General.
 This change was recommended by this Conference, and its adop­
                                                                0

tion, it seems to me, was entirely proper, inasmuch as the Attorney
 General no longer acts as the administrative officer of Federal
courts.
    The Department of Justice greatly appreciates the efforts of this
 Conference toward the development of better procedures for the
representation of indigent defendants in criminal cases in the Fed­
 eral district courts. S. 2206, which was introduced in the Congress
 on July 7 by Senator Kefauver, follows the suggestions made by
 this Conference and appears to me to represent a practical way
 of making counsel available to impoverished defendants without
 undue expense upon the Government and without imposing upon
 the time and services of members of the bar. The Department
 of Justice wholeheartedly approves this salutary legislation and
will be glad to support and endorse it. One point might be men­
 tioned, however, in connection with S. 2206. I note that in dis­
 tricts where no public defender is appointed and where counsel
 is appointed for particular cases, the counsel so appointed may
 be compensated at a rate not to exceed $35 a day for time neces­
 sarily expended in preparation and trial, in addition to reimburse­ _
 ment for expenses reasonably incurred and approved by the court.
 However, the aggregate amount expended for compensation and
                                 33 

reimbursement of counsel is not to exceed $5,000 for anyone fiscal
year in anyone district. In the event of an appeal, the assigned
counsel is to continue to represent the indigent defendant during
the appellate stages of the case and he may continue to be com­
pensated and reimbursed as set forth above, these expenditures
to be included within the $5,000 limitation.
   It seems to me that if several extended and lengthy trials occur
in a district during the same fiscal year and there are appeals in
those cases, the $5,000 limitation may well be exceeded. The
cost of printing records and briefs in the appellate courts after a
lengthy trial and in a complex case runs very high. I am not sug­
gesting that the $5,000 limitation be raised, but I am suggesting
that consideration be given to adding a provision in this bill to the
effect that the assignment of counsel pursuant to the bill shall
in no way affect the otherwise existing right to proceed in forma
lXI/U/penS.   The elimination of the necessity of printing briefs
and records in appellate courts in many cases will, of course, result
in an economy to the Government itself. It is true that there is
nothing in the bill as now drafted which expressly excludes the
right to proceed in forma pauperis in appropriate cases, but I be.;.
lieve the suggestion I have made is desirable in order to assure
against any construction to that effect.
   Recently, certain criminal trials which have been conducted by
the Department, and which have gained prominence in the press,
have brought about several suggestions for various changes in
Federal criminal practice and procedure. These suggestions have
been directed to the Department as well as to the President, and in
some cases have come from congressional sources. It might be
fitting if I were to call your attention to several of them.
   It has been suggested to the President that in criminal trials of
great importance and anticipated great length, the chief judge of
the district court be authorized to appoint an additional judge to
sit during the trial. At the present time, neither the statutes nor
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permit the designation of
an alternate or substitute judge except after a verdict or finding
of guilty. The sole function of this second judge would be to
assume the duties of the regular presiding judge in the event that
the latter died or became incapacitated, just as in the case of alter­
nate jurors. The obvious argument in support of this suggestion
is that the designation of an alternate judge would in many cases
prevent unnecessary mistrials, would relieve the parties from the
                                 34 

burden and expense of retrying the case, and would also remove the
unfair advantage that might accrue to a defendant, in a new trial,
brought about by the prior disclosure of the Government's case
during the course of the first triaL On the other hand, the con­
tingency is fairly remote that the services of the second judge would
ultimately be required, and it may be inadvisable to tie up a sec­
ond judge in any district on that remote contingency. Even with
with the additions to district courts authorized by Public Law
205, a procedure which would completely tie up two judges for an
extended period of time should probably not be authorized unless
a great deal of careful study is given to the matter and proper lim­
itations and restrictions are placed upon the discretion of the chief
judge, both for his own protection against pressure and for the
efficient and economical operation of the district courts.
   This Conference is authorized by statute to "prepare plans for
assignment of judges to or from circuits or districts where neces­
sary" and to make {(recommendations for legislation" (28 U. S. C.
331) and it seems appropriate to call the above suggestion to the
attention of the Conference for such consideration as you may wish
to give to it. The Department of Justice has advised the President
that this matter would be called to your attention.
   Another suggestion brought about as a result of recent criminal
                                                                        o
trials has to do with protecting against the disclosure of informa­
tion, during espionage trials or other trials involving the national
security, which in the interest of national security should be kept
secret. It has been suggested that a study be made concerning the
possibility of formulating changes in the rules of evidence or in
criminal procedure which would protect the national interest and
security and at the same time would offer a defendant the proper
scope of his constitutional rights.
   It is the view of the Department of Justice that the problem
of protecting against the disclosure of national security documents
or information during the course of criminal trials is not as serious
Of all-embracing as it is thought to be in many quarters. The
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held, and I believe
properly, that if a defendant desires the introduction in evidence
of a confidential Government document, he must first prove to the
satisfaction of the court that the paper is directly material to his
defense. Thereafter, the court will permit the introduction of
only such part of the document as it deems material, and will ex­
clude and seal all immaterial and irrelevant portions. United
                                       35 

       States v. Andolschek, 142 F. 2d 503; United States v. Koulewitch,
~      145 F. 2d 76; United States v. Cohen, 145 F. 2d 82; United State.'1
        v. Ebeling, 146 F. 2d 254. It is also the view of the Department
       .of Justice that, consistently with the constitutional requirements
       of a public trial, even those parts of confidential documents which
       the judge has ruled material and admissible may be protected from
       disclosure to the public by limiting their examination and inspec­
       tion to the judge, the attorneys and the jury. On appeal, the
        material may be kept under seal and viewed only by the members
       of the appellate courts. I t seems to me that this procedure would
       adequately take care of a very substantial segment of the problem.
       Perhaps specific legislation is necessary in order to insure uni­
       formity of practice in all the Federal courts.
           The real difficulty lies in certain cases where the information is
       such that it cannot be disclosed even to the court, the attorneys
       or the jury.. In many cases .of this type the Department has been
       compelled to refrain from prosecuting, and known violators of the
       law remain at large. Very careful consideration, it seems to me,
       should be given to this aspect of the pr.oblem. Within the execu­
~ tive branch of the Government, the problem is important not
.....I only to the Department of Justice, but also to the Department of
       State, the Department of Defense, and the Atomic Energy Com­
       mission, among others. Because of this Government-wide inter­
       est, the problem has been brought to the attention of the Inter­
       Departmental Committee on Internal Security (ICIS) operating
       under the National Security Council. It may be that this C.on­
       ference also will wish to give independent consideration to the
       problem, and it is for that reason that I have called this matter
       to your attention. The Department of Justice's representative
       on the Inter-Departmental Committee will be available at any
       time to cooperate with any committee that might be established
       by this Conference to deal with this matter.
           In reading the report of the proceedings of the special meeting
       of this Conference on March 24 and 25, 1949, I noticed that a
       committee was appointed to study and report, together with rec­
       ommendations, on legislation proposed to prohibit the picketing
       of courts. The Department of Justice has also concerned itself
       with this problem. In recent months reports have been trans­
-. mitted to the House Committee on the Judiciary concerning H. R.
___ 3766 and H. R. 5647 and to the Senate Corhmittee on the Judi­
       ciary on S. 1681. In these reports the Department of Justice
                                   36
pointed out that the question whether legislation of this type
should be enacted was primarily a matter of legislative policy
upon which the Department preferred not to comment. The De­
                                                                           J
partment did, however, suggest for the consideration of the Com­
mittees the possibility that existing provisions of the Criminal
Code might be adequate to protect against interference with the
administration of justice in most cases. And, on the assumption
that the proposed legislation would be given active consideration,
the Department suggested certain changes in the bills which were
thought desirable and necessary in order to remove possible consti­
tutional objections. Drafts embodying these changes were trans­
mitted to the Committees, and I might point out that the Senate
Committee which reported favorably on S. 1681, after joint hear­
ings with the House Committee, adopted the changes suggested
by the Department (S. Rep. No. 732, 81st Cong.).
   I might add here that I am not entirely satisfied in my own mind
as to the necessity or desirability of legislation of this type, despite
what was said on this point in the report of the Senate Judiciary
Committee. As appears from the Committee report, the practice
of picketing courts is of recent origin and has been employed solely
in connection with proceedings involving alleged Communist Party
members or communist sympathizers. It may well be that
                                                                           0
this practice is only a passing phase, and, in any event, ad hoc
legislation in this field may, in the long run, not be the proper way
to handle the problem. I will be very much interested to learn
the views of the committee of this Conference concerning this
subject.
   Since the last meeting of this Conference, Attorney General
Clark exchanged some correspondence with Chief Judge Magruder
in an effort to arrive at a mutually satisfactory modification of
the so-called Expediting Act in antitrust cases. It is my under­
standing that some members of the Conference Committee feel
that the requirement of existing law which makes it mandatory
upon the chief judge of the circuit to convene a three-judge court
upon the filing of an expediting certificate by the Attorney Gen­
eral in many instances causes extreme inconvenience and prej­
udices other business on the court docket. It was suggested that
the mandatory feature be eliminated and that the chief judge be
required to convene a three-judge court only "if in his judgment
the case is of sufficient general public importance to warrant the
constitution of a court of three judges, and if in his judgment
                                     37 

    the constitution of such a court would not, in the circumstances,
~	 unduly prejudice the dispatch of other judicial business in the
   circuit." Attorney General Clark advised Chief Judge Magruder
    that the Department of Justice is willing to endorse an amend­
    ment to the Expediting Act which would eliminate the manda­
    tory feature from existing law and which would permit the chief
    judge to convene or not to convene a three-judge court, depending
    upon whether, in his discretion, the assignment of three judges
   would disrupt other judicial business in the circuit. He stated,
    however, that the discretion of the chief judge of the circuit should
    be limited to the question of the effect of the convening of a three­
    judge court upon the judicial business in the circuit, and that the
    question whether the particular case was of sufficient general im­
    portance should remain for the Attorney General's determina­
    tion. As Attorney General Clark pointed out, an antitrust case
   is instituted by the Department of Justice only after a great deal
    of study and investigation by the Department's staff. At the
    time the case is instituted, the Department has full knowledge of
    all the facts and is in a position to understand completely the re­
    lationship of that particular case to current antitrust policy. It
:;)is extremely difficult for the chief judge to evaluate the general
    importance of any particular case upon a mere reading of the com­
    plaint and without full knowledge of all the facts and of the re­
    lationship of the particular case to other cases in process. I wish
    to state here that I wholeheartedly endorse the position of Attor­
    ney General Clark and that the Department will continue to c0­
    operate with your Conference Committee in an effort to work out
   a satisfactory compromise along these lines.
       I would like at this time to say a few words concerning a bill now
    pending in the Congress which I believe to be of great interest to
    this Conference. I refer to H. R. 2722 which would amend section
    144 of Title 28 of the United States Code dealing with the proced­
    ure for disqualifying Federal district judges because of bias or
    prejudice. H. R. 2722 would make several changes in existing
    law, but the most fundamental change is one that would com­
    pletelyalter the present procedure.
       As you know, under the law as it now stands, a district judge
    must disqualify himself if he finds the affidavit filed against him
 _ to be legally sufficient, and he must accept as true all the facts
"_ stated in the affidvait. Thereafter, another judge is appointed
                                 38

by the chief judge of the circuit to hear the case. If, however, the     ,
district judge refuses to disqualify himself, an appeal will lie from ...,
his ruling, and, in appropriate cases, mandamus or prohibition is
available. The only function of the chief judge of the circuit in
these cases is to designate another judge when the district judge
has actually disqualified himself.
   H. R. 2722 would completely change this procedure. It pro­
vides that when an affidavit of prejudice is filed, the district judge
shall preside no longer but shall send an authenticated copy of the
affidavit of prejudice to the chief judge of the circuit who "shall
then pass upon the legal sufficiency of the affidavit. If he shall
find it legally sufficient, he shall forthwith designate another judge
to hear such matter." Under this change, the district judge no
longer would have the authority to pass upon the legal sufficiency
of the affidavit; his only function would be to pass it along to the
chief judge of the circuit who would then pass upon its legal suffi­
ciency. It is my own view that the present procedure affords
ample protection to litigants in most cases, particularly in view
of the availability of an appeal or the right to mandamus or pro­
hibition in special cases. Quite apart from that, however, the
proposed change would seem to present several difficulties which
merit consideration. Suppose, for example, the chief judge of the"
                                                                     0
circuit found the affidavit not to be legally sufficient. The trial
would undoubtedly proceed with the original judge sitting in the
case but in any subsequent appeal on the whole case in which the
prejudice or bias of the district judge was made an issue, the chief
judge of the court of appeals would undoubtedly be automatically
disqualified because he had previously ruled upon the sufficiency
of the affidavit. Any procedure which would permit such an
automatic disqualification of the chief judge of the circuit would,
indeed, seem to be open to question. Finally, if the chief judge
holds the affidavit insufficient and the case is otherwise appropri­
ate for mandamus or prohibition, the question arises as to where
the litigant could go to get his writ. He certainly could not go
to the district court for a writ directed to the chief judge of the
circuit, and it is questionable whether the court of appeals could
issue a writ of prohibition or mandamus against its own chief
judge. If, as a legal matter, the writ could be obtained from the
Supreme Court of the United States, the question arises whether
it is desirable to burden the Supreme Court with this type of liti- -­
gation, particularly in the early stages of any particular case.

  H. R. 2722 contains several other interesting changes of existing
law, but I shall not burden the Conference with them at this time.
  In closing this report to the Conference, I wish to emphasize
what I stated before. The work of this Conference is of real im­
portance. To be a part of it is indeed a privilege. And it is most
gratifying that my appearance here constitutes one of my first
functions as Attorney General.
