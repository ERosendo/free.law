           ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES CoURTS

  Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts. 1-The Director submitted his eleventh annual report
reviewing the activities of his office for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1950, including the report of the Division of Procedural Studies
and Statistics. The Conference ordered the report received and
authorized its immediate release for publication. The Director
was authorized to incorporate statistical data not now available,
and to correct errors of a nonsubstantive nature in the printed
edition of the report to be issued later.

                           BUSINESS OF THE COURTS

   State of the dockets of the Federal courts-Courts of appeals.­
The number of cases commenced in the courts of appeals was only
slightly less than last year, 2,830 as compared with 2,989. The
reduction occurred in appeals from the district courts. Adminis­
trative appeals were at about the same level. There were 300 more
cases terminated than last year and 234 more were closed than
were filed with the result that the pending caseload was reduced to
1,675 on June 30, 1950. The median time from filing the complete
record to final disposition of cases heard and submitted remained
the same as last year, 7.1 months and from argument to decision
it was 1.5 months, a fraction less than in the fiscal year 1949. The
District of Columbia Circuit with 434 cases had the largest number
of incoming cases, the Fifth Circuit was second with 408 and the
Second and Ninth Circuits were next in order with 318 and 317,
respectively.
  , For convenience, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts,
and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, are hereinafter referred to as
the Director, and the Administrative Office. respectively.

  Over the 10-year period beginning with 1941, there has been some
decrease in the number of cases filed annually but this has been due
principally to a decline in the volume of appeals from the Tax
Court of the United States (462 in 1941 to 239 in 1950) and from
the National Labor Relations Board (248 to 167). Six new circuit
judgeships created in 1949 have been of major assistance in re­
ducing the pending caseload.
   Petitions to the Supreme Court for review on certiorari to the
United States courts of appeals exceeded the number filed during
the previous term. 663 petitions were docketed during the most
recent term, 67 were granted, 560 denied, and 8 dismissed.
  District courts.-A small increase in the number of civil actions
commenced in the United States district courts in the fiscal year
1950 was accompanied by a large increase in the number terminated.
Still, the cases filed exceeded the number closed by 1,363 and the
number pending at the end of the year rose to 55,603, the highest
point since 1933. The fluctuations over the past 10 years are
shown by the following table which gives separate figures for all
civil cases and for those between private litigants:

  Over the lO-year period there has been a definite upward trend,
particularly noticeable in the private cases. In the period from
1945 to 1947 the volume of all civil cases was greatly increased by
the large number of OPA price and rationing cases brought by the
Government. The decline in private cases during the war has
been followed by a steady year by year increase so that the number
commenced in 1950, 32.193, was 47 percent above the 1941 figure.
For all civil cases the increase was 42 percent. During the same
period the number of district judgeships has risen by only 12
percent.
                                  4

   Since on the average civil cases take much more judicial time
than criminal cases and private cases more than civil actions in
which the United States is a party, it is not surprising to find some
<locket congestion. However, this exists principally in metropoli­
tan centers including New York City, Washington, D. C., Newark,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Cleveland. Twenty-two
new district judgeships provided by the Eighty-first Congress in
1949 including positions in almost all of the districts just men­
tioned have been of material assistance. But the condition in the
Southern District of New York is still extremely serious where, on
June 30, 1950, 11,134 civil cases were pending and the estimated
period from issue to trial was reported as 23 months in nonjury
cases, 25 months in jury cases, and 30 months in admiralty cases.
   The median time from filing to disposition of civil cases tried in
86 district courts in 1950 was 11.2 months compared with 10.4
months in 1949. If seven metropolitan districts are excluded, the
median in 1950 was 9.6 months, which was still, however, 1.2
months longer than for the same districts in 1949.
   The number of criminal cases commenced in the district courts
was 36,383 as compared with 34,432 in the fiscal year 1949. Cases
terminated were practically equal to the number begun and of the
8,181 cases pending on June 30, 1950, approximately 2,000 involved
fugitive defendants whose cases could not be tried because they
were not available. Generally speaking, the criminal dockets are
in excellent condition. Statistics in the Director's Report show
 that immigration cases constituted about 30 percent of all criminal
 cases commenced in 1950 and that 97 percent of them, involving
illegal entry into the United States, were filed in the five districts
 bordering on Mexico. If these cases are eliminated, it is apparent
 that the number of other criminal cases commenced in 1941 was
 one-sixth larger than in 1950. In other words, excluding immigra­
 tion, Federal criminal prosecutions have decreased noticeably dur-      ~~
 ing the past decade.
    The number of bankruptcy cases continued to increase in 1950          ,
 but the percentage of growth was less than in 1949. Cases com­
 menced were 33,392 and terminations reached 25,582, leaving
 38,376 cases pending at the end of the year, the highest total in 7
 years. Over the past 10 years, there has been a sharp drop in
 cases filed from 56,335 in 1941 to a low of 10,196 in 1946, since
 which time there has been an increase of about two and one-third
                                 5

times. The referee system is entirely self-supporting and all ad­
vances made by the Government since its establishment have been
repaid.
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

   General.-The Conference reviewed the state of the dockets, and
the work of each of the district courts and courts of appeals com­
prising the Federal judiciary. Conditions relating to the courts
within each particular circuit were discussed by the Chief Judge
of that circuit, and the Conference was informed of matters pecu­
liar to such courts. Statistical data relating to the current and
prospective business of the courts were presented by the Director.
The attention of the Conference was also directed to factors which,.
because of their character, were impossible to weigh in these data,.
but which had a material and substantial effect upon the dispatch
of the courts' business. The prospects as to the availability of
judges for assignments outside their own districts during the com­
ing year were considered.
   It was the sense of the Conference that the following action
with respect to judgeships throughout the judiciary should be
recommended:

            PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS REAFFIRMED

   Eastern, Middle, and Western Pennsylvania Districts.-That the
act of July 24,1946 (60 Stat. 654), creating a district judgeship for
these districts be amended so as to provide that the present incum­
bent shall succeed to the first vacancy occurring in the position
of district judgeship for the Middle District of "Pennsylvania, and
that, thereafter, the judgeship created by that act for the Eastern,
Middle, and Western Districts of Pennsylvania shall not be filled.
   Eastern Texas District.-The creation of one additional district
judgeship.
   Northern Ohio District.-The creation of one additional district
judgeship.
   Northern and Southern Indiana Districts.-The creation of one
district judgeship for service in both districts.
   Eastern and Western .Missouri Districts.-The existing tem­
porary judgeship for these districts to be made permanent.
   Territory of Alaska-Third Division.-The creation of one addi­
tional judgeship.
                                 6


             ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS RECOMMENDED

  Southern District of New Y ork.-The creation of five additional
district judgeships, with the proviso that the first two vacancies
occurring in this district shall not be filled.
  Delawm-e District.-The creation of one additional district
judgeship.
  Middle District of Tenne88ee.-The creation of one additional
district judgeship, with the proviso that the first vacancy occurring
in this district shall not be filled.
  The Director was instructed to present these recommendations
to the Congress and to urge the prompt enactment of legislation
necessary to carry them out.

              ADDI'l'IONAL JUDGESHIPS DISAPPROVED

  Southern District of Florida.-The attention of the Conference
was directed to Senate Bill 4105 and House Bill 9571 presently
pending in the Congress which would provide for the creation of
an additional district judgeship on a temporary basis for this
District.
   Upon consideration of the recent change in conditions in the dis-    ,
trict; the case load and present condition of the docket, it Wail
the sense of the Conference that the proposed additional district
judgeship was not necessary at this time, and that the pending
proposal be disapproved.
   The Director was instructed to advise the Chairmen of the
Judiciary Committees of the House of Representatives and the
Senate of this action.
      BUDGET AND DEFICIENCY ApPROPRIATION ESTIMATES

  The estimates of expenditures and appropriations necessary for
the maintenance and operation of the United States Courts and
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for the fiscal
year 1952 were considered by the Conference. The Director was
authorized to revise the estimates submitted to include the estimate
of costs incident to the reclassification of the position of senior
courtroom deputy or minute clerk authorized by the Conference.
The estimates as so amended were approved by the Conference.
  After consideration, the Conference approved the estimates for
deficiency appropriations for the fiscal years 1950 and 1951.

             SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS

   The report of the. Committee on Supporting Personnel of the
United States Courts was presented and discussed by Chief Judge
John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Committee, and Chief Judge Har­
old M. Stephens, a member of the Committee.
   Upon consideration of the report and recommendations of the
Committee, the Conference authorized and directed that the posi­
tion of Senior Court Room Deputy or Minute Clerk in those Clerks'
Offices of the District Courts which are, for administrative purposes,
known as large offices be classified in grade as 8. The Conference
directed that only those positions in the group specified whose over~
all duties encompass to a substantial degree all of the various du­
ties set forth in the job analysis sheet submitted, should receive
such classification.
   Law clerks and secretaries-Civil-service status.-The Confer­
ence reaffirmed its approval of legislation which will permit the sec­
retary, secretary-law clerk, or law clerk of any Federal justice or
judge who has served for four years and who has been separated
from the service involuntarily and without prejudice, to acquire
for transfer purposes a classified civil-service status upon passing a
noncompetitive civil-service examination.
                  THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM

   The Committee on Supporting Personnel of the Courts, pur­
suant to authority extended to it by the Chief Justice, heard repre­
sentatives of the various Court Reporter organizations, and indi­
vidual Reporters, with respect to a number of problems affecting
the Court Reporting System. The report and recommendations
of the Committee were presented and discussed by Chief Judge
John Biggs, Jr., Chairman, and Chief Judge Stephens and Circuit
Judge Maris, members, of the Committee.
   Upon consideration of the report and recommendations of the
Committee, the Conference directed that the Committee of the
Conference on the Court Reporting System be reactivated for the
purpose of considering the question of compensation, including
transcript rates, and other relevant factors involved in a compre­
hensive study of the subject, and, also, such other problems as may
be presented, and that such Committee submit a report of their con­
clusions and recommendations at the next meeting of the Con­
ference.
                                  8

   The Conference further directed that the Administrative Office
furnish the Committee with such data and render such other serv­
ices as may be required; and, that the Administrative Office sub­
mit recommendations to the Committee with respect to its views
concerning proper levels of compensation for each individual re­
porter.
   Upon recommendation of the Director, the Conference, in view
of the recently created judgeships, and in line with its policy stand­
ards, authorized the immediate establishment of the following new
court reporter positions at the salaries indicated:
        Northern Di8trict of Illinoi8.-Two new court reporter posi­
     tions at a salary of $5,000 per annum, respectively.
        Di8trict Court of Guam.-One new court reporter position
     at a salary of $4,300 per annum.
   Salary increases in specific districts.-A review of the job content~
working conditions, and the earnings in those districts in which
specific salary increases had been requested was had. The Con­
ference authorized the following increases in salary of the reporters
concerned:
        District of Alaska.-The salaries of the various reporters
     serving in the first, second, and fourth divisions, who also serve
     as secretary to the judges, from $4,500 to $5,000 per annum.
   The Conference directed that the increases so authorized shaH
be on a temporary basis, but remain in force and effect until such
time as the Conference considers and acts upon the report and rec­
ommendations of its Committee on the Court Reporting Sv"t.f'ln
with respect to the over-all situation.
                  BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

  The report of the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative
Office dated June 15, 1950, approved and adopted by the Director,
recommending certain changes in the number and salaries of ref­
erees, and other changes in referee arrangements, based upon con­
clusions drawn from studies and resurveys conducted throughout
the year, was submitted for the consideration of the Conference.
   Pursuant to the provisions of section 37b (1) of the Bankruptcy
Act, as amended, the Administrative Office made resurveys of var­
ious territories and referees' offices during the year. These surveys
                                  9

were made usually at the request of the district judges or the
referees. In each instance the original surveys which covered the
10- and 5-year periods ending June 30, 1946, were extended
through March 31, 1950. These surveys took into account the
number, size, and type of pending cases; the number, size, and type
of new cases referred since July 1, 1947; the payments in each
district and by each referee into the salary and expense funds; the
time necessarily spent in traveling; the proportion and character
of cases arising away from headquarters, and the number of large
asset and arrangement cases handled. Consideration was also given
to the amount and character of judicial work required of the
referee.
    As a result of these studies and resurveys, it was evident that
there were three principal factors contributing to the need for
enlarged referee service-( 1) the sustained and continuing increase
in the volume of business; (2) the large increase in the number and
size of asset and arrangements cases, and (3) the great increase in
the amount of litigation of all kinds before the referees. The latter
factor results from the fact that Bankruptcy Courts have now be­
come recognized as the court of general jurisdiction in bankruptcy
matters after a referral has been made.
    Practically every district in which any change was recommended
was visited by representatives of the Bankruptcy Division who
 conferred with the district judges, the referees and others interested
in bankruptcy matters. Consideration was also given to the salaries
 presently provided in other districts to the end that the increases
 recommended would not create disparities in comparable districts.
 The information thus assembled was submitted to the district
 judges and the circuit councils concerned. It was also considered
 by the Committee on Bankruptcy Administration, and the Con­
 ference had before it all of these data, together with recom­
 mendations of the district judges and the circuit councils, which
 had been received at the time of the meeting of the Conference.
 The recommendations of the Director and the Committee were
 considered separately in the light of the foregoing information
 along with any special factors affecting each case. Also the Con­
 ference had before it additional data compiled as of the close of the
 fiscal year ending June 30, 1950, and in some instances through
 July and August, 1950.

   The Conference thereupon took the following action:

   The Conference· authorized these salary increases to be effective
as of October 1, 1950.

                   CHANGES IN REFEREE ARRANGEMENTS

   Southern District of California.-Authorized, effective January
1, 1951, the appointment of a part-time referee at San Bernardino,
at an annual salary of $1,500 per year. The Conference designated
San Bernardino as the regular place of office, and San Bernardino
and Riverside as places of holding court; the territory to be served
by this referee to include San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.
   Western District of Missouri.-Designated Jefferson City as a
place of holding court, instead of Sedalia.
   Northern District of Ohio-Western Division.-Designated Fre­
mont, Lima, and Marion, Ohio, as additional places of holding
court.
   Chief Judge. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on Bank­
ruptcy, informed that there had been presented to the Committee
for its consideration several amendments to the Bankruptcy Act
designed to meet certain practical difficulties under some of the
provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, and that it was the view of a
majority of the Committee that the following amendments to the
Bankruptcy Act should be approved and recommended by the
Conference.
                                       11 

   Referees-Tenure of service.-There should be a provision under
 the statute to the effect that a referee upon the expiration of his
 term of office shall continue to serve until a successor is appointed
 and qualifies. The purpose of this proposal is to prevent a lapse
jn referee service caused by a delay in the appoilHUlcnt of a referee
 upon expiration of his regular term of office. In order to so pro­
'vide, the Committee recommended that Sec. 34a (11 U. S. C. 62a)
:be amended by adding the following sentence at the end of the
 paragraph:
   Upon the expiration of his term, a referee in bankruptcy shall continue to
,perform the duties of his office until his successor is appointed and qualifies.
    The Conference approved of the Committee's recommendation,
 and approved of the proposed ame.qdment to Sec. 34a (11 U. S. C.
.6 2a).
    Referees-Place of holding court.-There is a conflict between
 the provision of Sec. 55a of the Bankruptcy Act (Title 11, U. S. C.
 sec. 91a) and Sec. 37b (1) (Title 11, U. S. C. Sec. 65b (1». Sec.
 55a provides that the first meeting of creditors shall be held "at
 the county seat of the county in which the bankrupt has had his
 principal place of business, resided, or had his domicile" and Sec.
 37b (1) as amended by the Salary Act provides that the Judicial
 Conference shall determine "the places at which courts shall be
 held."
    In order to eliminate this apparent inconsistency, the Committee
 proposed that Sec. 55a (Title 11, U. S. C. Sec. 91a) be amended
 to read as follows:
  The court shall cause the first meeting of the creditors of a bankrupt to be
held not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the adjudication, at the
place or at one Of the places designated by the Conference pursuant to 8ec.
37b (1) as a place at which court shan be held within the Judicial District in
which the bankrupt has had his principal place of business, resided or had his
domicile; or if that place would be manifestly inconvenient as a place of meeting
for the parties in interest, or if the bankrupt is one who does not do business,
reside, or have his domicile within the Lnited States, the court shall fix a
place for the meeting which is the most convenient for parties in interest. If
such meeting should by any mischance not be held within such time, the court
shall fix the date, as soon as may be thereafter, when it shall be held. [New
language in italics.]
 The Conference concurred in the Committee's views, and recom­
 mended the enactment of the proposed amendment to Sec. 55a
 of the Bankruptcy Act.
    Referees-Temporary assignment and designation of.-Judge
 Phillips called the attention of the Conference to the provisions
                                 12 


of Public Law 790, Eighty-first Congress, approved September
19, 1950, under which the temporary assignment of a referee within
a circuit may be made by the chief judge of the circuit upon pre­
sentation of a certificate of necessity by the judge or chief judge
of the district wherein the need arises, whereas, prior to the enact­
ment of this act, action was required by the entire judicial council
of the circuit. The present law also provides ior the temporary
assignment of a referee from one circuit to another to be made by
the Chief Justice of the United States upon presentation of a cer­
tificate of the chief judge of the circuit wherein the need arises,
whereas, prior to the enactment of this act, action by the entire
Judicial Conference of the United States was necessary.
   Referees' salaries and o;rrangements-Resurveys of.-The pro­
cedure prescribed by the Bankruptcy Act to effect changes in the
number and territories of referees, changes in referees' salaries, and
the filling of vacancies by expiration of terms that occur every
2 years in approximately one-third of the offices of referees is
substantially the same. I t involves a recommendation by the
Director to the district judges and the circuit councils concerned,
an expression of their views, and the approval or authorization          .­
of the Judicial Conference of the United States.
   In the past, separate studies have been made and there has
been a considerable duplication of work. The studies upon which
the recommendations for the filling of vacancies are based must be
commenced immediately after the first of the calendar year in
order to provide ample time for the completion of such studies and
the submission of recommendations to the conference. In the
view of the Committee, in the interest of efficiency and economy,
it is highly desirable to make the general surveys at such time.
The district and circuit courts are then in session and can more·
readily consider the recommendations than during the summer
months. In addition, the committee was of the opinion that the·
intent of the act was that a general survey of the system should
be made every 2 years inasmuch as the referees' terms are stag­
gered so that approximately one-third of their terms expire every
2 years. Chief Judge Phillips reported that a majority of the
Committee had approved of the consolidation of the resurveys of
referees' salaries and arrangements with the study and report on
the needs for filling vacancies occurring by expiration of referees"
terms of office every 2 years.                                           ./
                                 13 

   The Conference was in accord with the Committee's views and
directed that general resurveys of referees' salaries and arrange­
ments be made at the same time that the study and surveys are
conducted on the needs for filling vacancies occurring by expiration
of referees' terms every 2 years; that such general surveys be con­
fined to those referees' offices involved in the study.
   The Conference also authorized the conduct of special surveys
in cases where unusual conditions or an emergency develops which
in the opinion of the Director and the Chief of the Bankruptcy
Division of the Administrative Office justify such survey. These
special surveys shall be made in time to secure the views of the
district judges and the circuit councils concerned for submission
to the Bankruptcy Committee of the Conference so that it will
have ample opportunity for consideration and report to the Judi­
eial Conference at its next scheduled meeting.

                   OTHER COMMITTEE REPORTS

   Three-judge district (expediting) courts.-Chief Judge Ma­
gruder, Chairman of the Committee of the Conference appointed
"to make study concerning the proposal to eliminate or modify
the provisions for a three- judge district (expediting) court in anti­
trust cases as presently provided for under Title 15 U. S. Code 28"
reported that a bill (H. R. 6451) had been introduced in the Con­
gress, the provisions of which were in accord with the recommenda­
tions of the Conference. It was stated that the Attorney General
was in agreement with the proposal and would urge the adoption
of the measure.
   The proposed amendment would eliminate the present manda­
tory provisions of the statute under which a special three-judge
tribunal must be created under certain conditions, and would vest
discretion to determine whether the designation of three judges to
hear a case of the nature specified "would unduly prejudice the
dispatch of other judicial business in the circuit" in the Chief Judge
of the particular circuit involved.
   The Conference thereupon recommended that the amendment
to Title 15, U. S. C. 28, as proposed by the present provisions of
H. R. 6451, introduced in the House of Representatives on Octo­
ber 17, 1949, be promptly enacted.
   Wages and effects of deceased or deserting seamen.-District
Judge William C. Coleman, Chairman of the Committee of the
                                 14 


Conference appointed "to consider some more satisfactory method'
of dealing with the wages and effects of deceased or deserting sea­
men than that presently provided under existing law" presented
and discussed the report of the Committee.
   In accord with its policy, the Conference directed that the report
be received and circulated throughout the Judiciary in order that
the views and suggestions of the various judges may be ascertained,
and that, in the light of such additional information, the Commit­
tee submit a further report to the Conference.
   Punishment for crime-Treatment and rehabilitation of youth
offenders.-Chief Judge Orie L. Phillips, chairman of the suooom­
mittee of the Conference Committee on Punif:'hment for Crime oll'
the subject matter of the treatment and rehabilitation of youth,
offenders reported that the "Youth Authority Bill" (which had'
then passed the Congress and was subsequently on September 30,
1950, approved by the President) had adopted in principle the
recommendations of the Conference on the subject matter, and
it was expected that functioning under the provisions of the act
would be commenced in the very near future.
   The Conference thereupon expressed its appreciation for the
efforts and work of its Committee.
   Operation of the jury system.-Judge Harry E. Watkins a mem­
ber of the Conference Committee on the Operation of the Jury
System, presented a progress report covering the work of the com­
mittee during the past year. He stated that very little had been
accomplished toward the enactment of legislation covering the
recommendations of the Conference, and urged that the Confer­
ence reaffirm its previous position with respect to legislation which
had been proposed in the Congress which, if enacted, would be in
accord with the views of the Conference.
   The Conference thereupon reaffirmed its approval of bills H. R.
2050, H. R. 2051, S. 50, and S. 49, as presently drawn, and recom­
mended their prompt enactment; it reiterated its disapproval of
the present provisions of H. R. 3207 and recommended against its
enactment.
   Appellate review of orders of certain administrative agencies.­
Chief Judge Orie L. Phillips, chairman of the consolidated com­
mittee of the Conference on the appellate revie,,, of orders of the
Interstate Commerce Commission and certain other administrative
agencies, presented a report with respect to the status of legielation
                                   15 

(H. R. 5487 and H. R. 5488) introduced in the Congress, the pro­
visions of which were in accord with the views and recommenda­
tions of the Conference.
   The Conference thereupon approved the present provisions of
H. R. 5487 and H. R. 5488, and urged that they be promptly
enacted.
  Indigent litigants-Protection of rights of in Federal Courts.­
The Director, pursuant to authorization by the Chairman of the
Conference Committee covering the subject-matter, reported on
the status of legislation (S. 2206) which had been introduced in the
Congress, the provisions of which were in accord with the views and
recommendations of the Conference.
   Thereupon, the Conference reaffirmed its approval of the present
provisions of S. 2206, and urged its prompt enactment.
   Pretrial procedure.-Circuit Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman
of the Committee of the Conference on Pretrial Procedure, pre­
sented and discussed the report of the Committee.
   The Committee indicated satisfaction over the expanded use of
pretrial procedure and was most appreciative of the cooperation
recived from the judges in their work.
   The Conference directed that the report of the committee be
received and that the proposals outlined in their planning of future
operations be approved. It further directed that the report of the
Committee be circulated throughout the judiciary as information,
and commended it for their consideration.
   Judicial statistics.-Pursuant to request and authorization of
the Chairman of the Conference Committee on Judicial Statisticst
the report of the Committee was presented and discussed by Mr.
Will Shafroth, Chief of the Division of Procedural Studies and
StatIstics. The Committee submitted for consideration and
approval by the Conference the following recommendations:
   1. That information now furnished quarterly to the circuit coun­
cils with reference to cases under advisement by district judges
should in the future also be sent to the district judges in each circuit.
   2. That circuit court clerks be asked to report quarterly to the
Administrative Office for inclusion in quarterly reports of that
office, the number of cases pending at the end of the quarter which
have been submitted more than 3 months previously with any ex­
planation in reference to individual cases as to reasons for delaYt
such as where the decision has been postponed, at the request of
                                     ]6 


the litigants, to await the decision in another case or for other good
reason.
  The Conference approved of these recommendations. It di­
rected that the report of the Committee be received and approved,
and authorized the circulation of the report throughout the judici­
ary as a matter of information.
  Revision of criminal and judicial codes.-Circuit Judge Albert B.
Maris, Chairman of the Conference Committee on the Revision of
the Criminal and Judicial Codes, presented and discussed the report
of the Committee.
  The attention of the Conference was called to the fact that under
the act of May 10, 1950, Public Law 510, amending section 3771 of
Title 18, U. S. C., and sections 2072 and 2073, Title 28, U. S. C.,
Rules of Criminal, Civil, and Admiralty Procedure adopted by the
Supreme Court could now be reported to the Congress during any
regular session up to but not later than May 1, and such rules may
take effect 90 days after the date on which they were so reported.
This amendment is in accord with the views and recommendations
of the Conference.
   The Committee proposed four amendments to existing statutes
in order to correct errors in and omissions from Titles 18 and 28,
U. S. C., respectively, which have been disclosed since the passage
of the Correction Act of May 24, 1949:
   1. Sec. 658, Title 18:
          That this section be amended by striking out the words "any
      production credit corporation or corporation in which a pro­
      duction credit corporation holds stock," and inserting, in lieu
       thereof, the words "any corporation organized under sections
       1131-1134m of Title 12, U. S. C., or in which a Production
       Credit Corporation holds stock,".
   2. 	 Sec. 48, 'Pitle 28:
          That this section be amended by adding a new paragraph,
       reading as follows:
      Any court of appeals may with the consent of the Judicial Conference ot
    the United States pretermit any regular term or session of the court at any
    place for insufficient business or other good cause.
  3. Sec. 411, Title 28:
        Second paragraph of subsection (c) of this section, be
     amended by striking out "Secretary of War" and inserting, in
     lieu thereof, "Secretary of the Army".
                                         17

         4. Sec. 2253, Title 28:
              Second paragraph of this section be amended by inserting
            after the phrase ilpursuant to section 3042 of Title 18" the
            words "or pursuant to any rule of criminal procedure prescribed
            by the Supreme Court of the United States under the authority
            of section 3771 of Title 18."
         Upon consideration of the proposed amendments, the effect
       thereof and the reasons and necessity therefor, the Conference
       approved of the proposed amendments and recommended their
       prompt enactment by the Congress. The Conference directed that
\. 	
       the Committee present these proposals to the respective Judiciary
i'l
•	     Committees of the two Houses of Congress, together with any other
       perfecting amendments designed to bring the language of Titles 18
       and 28 into accord with subsequent legislation and presidential re­
       organization plans which may be found to be necessary.
         Thereupon, the Conference ordered the report of the Committee
       received and approved.
                                  NEW BUSINESS

       RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCES AND COUNCILS
                           OF THE CIRCUITS

          The members of the Conference presented recommendations of
       their respective circuit judicial conferences and councils. Upon
       consideration of the proposals submitted, the Conference took the
       following action:
         Opinions of the courts of appeals-Printing and charge for.­
       The questions relating to the costs and manner of printing, and the
       charge to the public for copies, of the opinions of the courts of
       appeals, presented by the District of Columbia and Second Judi­
       cial Circuits, respectively, were referred to the Advisory Commit­
       tee of the Conference for consideration.
          Territorial Judges-Tenure and retirement, Virgin Islands.­
       Circuit Judge Maris, Chairman of the Committee of the Confer­
       ence of the Third Judicial Circuit appointed "to consider the mat­
       ter of tenure and retirement provisions of law relating to tbe Judge
       of the District Court of the Virgin Islands," submitted and dis­
       cussed the report of the Committee.
          It was pointed out that the Organic Acts of the Territories,
       namely, Puerto Rico, the Canal Zone, and the Virgin Islands origi­
       nally fixed the term of office of the judges of the district courts at 4
                                 18

years; that in 1938, the term of office for the district judges of the
Canal Zone and Puerto Rico was changed from 4 to 8 years; and,
in view of the fact that the individuals accepting appointments
for the district judgeship of the Virgin Islands were in the
same position as those accepting appointment in Puerto Rico and
the Canal Zone, and the same reasons which, apparently, guided
the Congress in extending the term of these particular judges from
4 to 8 years prevailed in so far as the Virgin Islands were concerned,
the Committee felt that the same tenure of service should be appli­
cable to the Virgin Islands. The Committee, therefore, proposed
legislation amending the Organic Act (sec. 26) of the Virgin Islands
of the united States, providing for a tenure of service for 8 years,
rather than 4 years; this would bring the term of service of the dis­
trict judge of the Virgin Islands in line with that presently pre­
scribed by the Organic Acts of Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone, as
amended by the Congress.
   It was the view of the Conference that the tenure of the judgeship
of the District Court of the Virgin Islands should be upon the same
level as those of the other territories involved, namely Puerto Rico
and the Canal Zone, and it approved of the proposed legislation so
providing submitted by the Committee and urged that its prompt
enactment by the Congress be effectuated.
   The Committee's views and recommendations with respect to
present statutory retirement benefits governing judges of the ter­
ritories and island possessions of the united States were considered
by the Conference. It directed that the subject matter be referred
to the Committee of the Conference on Retirement for its consid­
eration and recommendations.
   District courts-Jurisdiction and venue.-Chief Judge Parker
presented a resolution of the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit
with respect to legislation proposing to establish restrictions upon
the existing statutory power of the district courts in the transfer of
dvil cases. It was the opinion of Judge Parker, as well as that of
the judicial council of the fourth circuit, that, because of the num­
erous legislative proposals which had recently been introduced af­
 fecting the venue and jurisdiction of the courts, it was advisable to
have a Committee of the Conference created for the purpose of
considering the entire question of venue and jurisdiction of the
courts.
                                        19 


    The Conference, thereupon, directed that a Committee of the
 'Conference be appointed by the Chief Justice for the purpose of
  considering the question of venue and jurisdiction of the District
'Courts.
    Courts of appeals-Places of holding court.-Chief Judge Gard­
  ner presented a proposal submitted by the judges of the Court of
  App~als for the Eighth Judicial Circuit to amend section 48, Title
  28, U. S. C., specifying St. Louis, Kansas City, Omaha, and St. Paul
  as places for holding terms of that court by eliminating all but St.
  Louis. He advised that a bill (S. 4104) had been introduced in the
  Congress which, if enacted, would carry out this proposal.
    Upon consideration of the representations of Judge Gardner
'with respect to the effect of such proposal upon economies of opera­
 tion, convenience to litigants, and other relevant factors, the Con­
 ference approved of the provisions of S. 4104 as presently drawn,
,and recommended its prompt enactment by the Congress.
    Judges-Circuit and district-Resignation, retirement of.­
'Chief Judge Denman presented the resolution of the Judicial Con­
 ference of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, proposing that paragraph 4,
  section 371, Title 28, U. S. C., be amended to read as follows:
    Whenever any circuit or district judge eligible to resign or retire under this
 section or under section 872 does neither, and the President finds that such judgt'
 is unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of perma­
,nent mental or physical disability and that the appointment of an additional
 judge is necessary for the efficient dispatch of business, the President may make
 such appointment by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
   The Conference entered upon a discussion of the proposal, as well
 as other relevant questions to the subject matter. It was the sense
of the Conference that because of the numerous pertinent factors
 involved, it was desirable to have an over-all study of the problem
 by a Committee of the Conference. Thereupon, the Conference
 directed that a Committee of the Conference be appointed by the
 Chief Justice for the purpose of considering the specific proposal
,of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference and kindred matters; that
the Committee should have broad jurisdiction and encompass in
its consideration problems relating to retirement for age or disabil­
ity; seniority, designation and assignment; retention of personnel
 for retired judges, and other problems which in the direction of the
 committee were relevant to their study of the subject matter.
    United States Commissioners-District of Alaska-Compensa­
 tion.-The resolution of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference with
                                       20

respect to increasing the compensation of the United States Com­
missioners in the District of Alaska was presented by Chief Judge
Denman. The Conference directed that the matter be referred to
the Conference Committee on Supporting Personnel of the Courts
for consideration.
   Probation-Removal of civil disabilities upon fulfillment oj
terms of.-The resolution of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference
proposing an amendment to section 3651, Title 18, U. S. C., was pre­
sented for consideration. The Conference directed that the matter
be referred to the Conference Committee on the Removal of Civil
Disabilities of Probationers fulfilling the terms of their probation.
   Probation-Imposition of jail sentence as a condition of.-The
resolution of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference proposing that
section 3651, Title 18, U. S. Code be amended "to provide that the
court shall have power in granting probation to defendants in crimi­
nal cases to impose as a condition of probation that the defendant
be imprisoned in a jail-type institution for a period not exceeding 6·
months" was referred to the Conference Committee on the Removal
of Civil Disabilities of Probationers fulfilling the terms of their
probation.
   Felony-Definition of.-The resolution of the Ninth Circuit,
Judicial Conference, reading as follows:
  Re8olved: That paragraph (1) of Section 1 of Title 18 of the United States·
Code be amended by the addition thereto of the following:
  "Provided, That when a person is convicted of any felony and the sentence'
imposed by the court does not provide for imprisonment for a term exceeding 1
year, such person shall, for all purposes, after the judgment of conviction shall:
have become tlnal and after the sentence imposed upon him shall have expired,
be deemed to have been charged with and convicted of a misdemeanor, and such
person shall not suffer any disability or disqualification which would otherwise
result from a conviction of a felony."
was directed to be referred to the Conference Committee on Punish­
ment for Crime for its consideration.
   Wages and effects of deceased or deserting seamen.-The recom­
mendations and resolutions of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Con­
ference with respect to the subject matter were referred to the
Committee of the Conference on the method of dealing with the
wages and effects of deceased or deserting seamen, for its
consideration.
   Court reporters--Compensation.-The resolutions of the Ninth
Circuit Judicial Conference with respect to the question of proper
                                 21 


 compensation for Court Reporters in that Circuit were directed
 to be referred to the Conference Committee on the Court Reporting
 System.
     Courts of appeals-Admission fees.-The Conference considered
the problems involved under the subject matter, the focal point
ibeing the recent ruling of the Comptroller General of the United
  States with respect to the liability of the estate of the Clerk
'Df the Court of Appeals of the Third Judicial Circuit to the United
:States for the Clerk's failure to report monies received as payments
-from lawyers upon their admission to the bar of the court as
'receipts or emoluments of his office.
     It was the sense of the Conference, in view of the previous posi­
  tions taken by the Comptroller Generals, when similar issues were
raised, that the matter be referred to the Committee of the Con­
 ference on Library Funds, Court of Appeals, for its consideration
.and disposition.
     Courts-Jurisdiction-Diversity of citizenship-Amount neces­
 .sary to invoke.-The attention of the Conference was directed to
  various legislative proposals which had been introduced in the
 ,Congress under which the amount involved in litigation, in order to
 .come within the purview of the jurisdiction of the district courts,
 ,either as cases based upon Federal law or upon diversity of citizen­
 :ship, would be increased from the existing statutory minimum to
  various amounts, as set forth in the numerous legislative proposals
  which have been introduced.
     The Chief Justice presented a statement from the Hon. Emanuel
  Celler, Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Rep­
  resentatives, concerning the general topic.
     The Conference directed that the matter be referred to the Com­
  mittee of the Conference which had been authorized and directed to
  be created to consider the over-all problem of "venue and jurisdic­
  .tion" of the district courts of the United States.
     Retired judges-Personnel, office space, and equipment.-Chief
  Judge John Biggs, Jr., advised that, apparently because of his
  position as Chairman of the Conference Committee on Supporting
   Personnel of the Courts, numerous inquiries and recommendations
  had been made with respect to providing for secretaries, law clerks,
  .office space, and equipment for retired judges who render material
  .service to the judiciary; and, that while the Committee had not
  Jormally acted upon the question, it appeared that a majority of
                                 22 


them were in favor of such services being made available to those,
retired judges who rendered a substantial service to the judiciary.
He, thereupon, recommended that the Conference authorize the
Director of the Administrative Office to provide such personnel
services and adequate quarters for those retired judges performing
such services. Whereupon, the Conference directed that the Di­
rector permit retired judges to retain their personnel and be fur­
nished with suitable quarters, provided that they continue to per­
form substantial judicial work, that the question as to whether or
not the services performed are substantial will be a matter for de­
termination by the particular circuit judicial councils involved.
   Records-Court-Preservation of, method, etc.-The Director
presented a request of the District Court for the Northern Dis­
trict of Ohio that the installation of the microfilming method of
preservation of current records be authorized. He pointed out that
specific authority of the Conference for such installation was called
for under Rule 79 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and
under Rule 55 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, inas­
much as those rules provide that such records shall be kept in such
manner as the Director, with the approval of the Judicial Con­
ference, may prescribe.
   The Conference authorized the installation of the microfilming
method of preservation of current records in the Northern District
of Ohio. The Conference further directed that wherever, in the
opinion of the Director, the installation of such system of preserva­
tion of the records was warranted, the Director be empowered by
the authority of the Conference to authorize and approve the in­
stallation of such system of record preservation without the spe­
cific approval of the Conference in individual instances.
   Judges-District courts-Assignment of reserve or alter'nate
 judges in causes of unusual importance or protracted duration.­
The provisions of H. R. 6432 as introduced in the House of Repre­
sentatives on October 14, 1949, were considered by the Conference.
Thereupon, the Conference disapproved H. R. 6432 as presently
drawn, and directed .that the Director convey these views to the
 Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.
   Bail-Forfeiture of and remittal ordered-Appropriations
 available for.-The Director apprized the Conference of the fact
 that under existing appropriation acts, in those cases wherein the
court finds, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 46 (f) (4), Federal
                                23 

Rules of Criminal Procedure, "that justice does not require the en­
forcement" (forfeiture of bail), and an order is entered directing
the remission of bail previously forfeited, there is no authority to
pay the monies involved because of their coverage into the general
funds of the Treasury. In order to correct this apparent deficiency
of existing statutory provisions, it was recommended that an act
be passed providing that "Hereafter appropriations available for
refunding moneys erroneously received and covered shall be avail­
able for the refund of forfeited bail covered into the general fund
of the Treasury which has been ordered remitted, in whole or in
part, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
   The Conference was in accord with the views of the Director,
and directed that he advise the Congress of its position, and
recommend that the necessary legislation be enacted promptly.

                                   APPENDIX
        REPORT OF HON.   J. HOWARD MCGRATH, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE
                                   UNITED STATES

        Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference of the United
            States, Honored Guests:
           The annual meeting of the Judicial Conference is one of the
        reassurances that in our country the state is still the servant of its
        people and not a tyrant over them. With its plenary concern for
        the efficient administration of justice under law, the Conference is
        a sober reminder, above the clamor of temporary exigency, that our
        ship of state continues to maintain that course.
           Few responsibilities arising in the administration of justice since
        the recent war have been so urgent and yet so complex as that of
        assuring our national security and at the same time preserving
        individual civil liberties. This is a task of transcendent importance r
"..-<   and tests are arising in many ways.
           I do not feel free to discuss, at this Conference, the many situa­
        tions in which the balancing of these two considerations will be re­
        quired. I am sure you will agree that I should not, since many of
        them arise in cases now pending before the various Federal courts.
        However, I should not like to leave the subject without reference
        to a recent legislative proposal, affecting the judiciary, which seems
        now, happily, to have become moot. This was a resolution pro­
        posed by the Senate Judiciary Committee that it undertake an in­
        vestigation of the competence, fitness, and legal qualifications of
        the entire Federal judiciary. The proposal apparently was
        evoked because of displeasure with the Court of Appeals' decision
        directing the release on bail of Harry Bridges pending his appeal
        from conviction for perjury. On September 1, 1950, I wrote to the
        Senate in opposition to this resolution, pointing out that aside from
        important stated constitutional considerations such a step could
        only be construed by the public as a reprisal for the rendition of an
         honest interpretation of the law, an attempt to intimidate the
         judiciary, and a complete lack of confidence in our own institutions.
         I am happy to report that the Senate Judiciary Committee has re­
         versed itself and is no longer proposing this resolution.
                                          (27)
                                  28 


   A legislative proposal which this Conference might want to look
into, relating to judges, is H. R. 17, which would provide a novel
means for the removal of district judges. Under the bill, the Su­
preme Court would be empowered, upon probable cause, to desig­
nate three circuit judges as a special temporary court for trial upon
the issue of good behavior of any United States judge except those
of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal. In addition to the
three circuit judges, the Supreme Court would designate three
members of the bar to represent the judicial branch of the Govern­
ment in the preparation and trial of the issue of good behavior. The
bill would make the judgment of this special court final and, if it
determined that the behavior of the judge had been other than the
good behavior referred to in the Constitution, its judgment to that
effect would remove him from office without imposing any other
penalty. The bill has been favorably reported by the House Ju­
diciary Committee, but a sharply dissenting minority report hat'!
also been filed. The substantive issue of judicial self-policing, and
the constitutionality of court proceedings which smack of impeach­
ment, invite careful consideration by this Conference. To date the
Department of Justice has not been asked to comment, and has
not commented, on the bill.
   While we are on the subject of the removal of judges, I would
like to urge upon the Conference consideration of a related subject.
This is the desirability of finding ways and means for making
 greater use of existing statutes which deal with the retirement of
 judges for, disability. As you know, under present law, a judge
 desiring to retire for disability may do so upon furnishing a certifi­
 cate of disability to the President, signed by the Chief Justice or a
 chief judge, as the case may be. If he retires, he is entitled to re­
 ceive full salary for the balance of his lifetime, or half salary if he
 has served less than 10 years.
   Unfortunately, there are several situations where judges have
 been incapacitated and unable to serve for long periods of time.
 Of course, no man relishes retirement under such adverse circum­
 stances, and I can understand the reluctance of one so situated to
 seek retirement. Nevertheless, unless suggestions and promptings
 are forthcoming by the chief judges in such situations, I am con­
 cerned that future congressional activity in this field might prove
 embarrassing to the entire judiciary.
    Another legislative proposal, which the Conference might wish
 to examine, is H. R. 4202 proposing to empower the Supreme Court
                                  29 

to promulgate a code of ethics for attorneys practicing before the
Federal courts. I understand that the suggestion was prompted by
the thought of making disbarment proceedings an adjunct to the
existing power of contempt in preventing outrageous performances
by counsel, such as those which plagued recent trials at New York
and San Francisco. It would seem to me that exploration of the
appropriateness of this approach, along with any others for pro­
moting the orderly conduct of criminal and civil trials, is well
within the purview of this Conference. The Department of Justice
has not been requested to comment, and has not commented, on this
proposal.
   In the matter of antitrust litigation, I reported last year at some
length on a satisfactory agreement reached in correspondence be­
tween former Attorney General Clark and Chief Judge Magruder
in the matter of amending the so-called Expediting Act of February
11, 1903, 15 U. S. C. 28. Since that time a bill, H. R. 6451, has been
introduced to amend the Expediting Act by providing that upon
determination by the chief judge, or presiding circuit judge, that
the designation of three judges would unduly prejudice the dispatch
of other judicial business, the case may be assigned instead to a
single district or circuit judge with instructions to expedite its
hearing and determination. I should like to report that the De­
partment of Justice has written the House Judiciary Committee in
support of this legislation.
   I should also like to indicate the continuing interest of the De­
partment of Justice in respect to a recommendation which was sub­
mitted to this Conference by Attorney General Clark in his report
2 years ago. This concerns the designation in each antitrust case
of a single judge to hear all motions and other matters preliminary
to trial, to conduct all pretrial procedure, and to preside at the trial
of the case itself. When an antitrust case is pending in a court
which is composed of many judges and has a large volume of busi­
ness, the various motions necessary from time to time normally
come up for hearing before whatever judge happens to be assigned
to the motions calendar at the time the motion is made. This has
inevitably meant that each judge so involved must familiarize him­
self with comprehensive and highly involved pleadings and issues,
as well as with the prior proceedings in the case. This is, obviously,
time-consuming and needlessly burdensome. The procedure I am
supporting here has been followed, recently, in the United Shoe
                                  30 


M a,chinery case in Boston, and in the cases against the Borden Co.
and the Bowman Dairy Co. in Chicago, as well as in the Morgan
and Imperial Chemical Industries cases in the Southern District of
New York. I submit that consistent use of this procedure would
be desirable.
   One further problem connected with antitrust litigation seems to
me of sufficient importance to merit inclusion in this report. This
pertains to the use of masters in antitrust cases. In response to a
request for views from a Committee of this Conference concerning
the length and expense of trial in such cases, the Committee was
advised that in our opinion the use of masters for the trial of facts
in complex antitrust cases was a practice neither desirable nor
sound. Our experience indicates that such referral results in de­
lay; in unnecessary inflation of the record which must finally, in
spite of all, be read by the trial judge; in constant reference of mat­
ters back to the presiding judge even during the course of the trial;
and lastly, in what is effectively a retrial of the whole matter before
the judge when exceptions are taken to the master's report. It is
a procedure which would seem likely to yield only disorder in the
record and postponement of the time when the trial judge will,
inevitably, himself try the case. In view of the fact, that in June of
this year, the Armour case was assigned to a master for trial over
the protest of the Government, I should like to reiterate these
objections of the Department of Justice to the procedure.
   Turning to matters of criminal procedure, the transfer provisions
of Rule 20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure appear to
merit special mention. After this rule was unexpectedly held
invalid by the Oregon District Court in the Bink case some time ago,
its constitutionality was twice upheld in the last few months.
These favorable decisions were handed down by the Courts of Ap­
peal for the Eighth Circuit (United States v. Levine, 182 F. (2d)
556) and the Third Circuit (United States v. Gallagher, not yet
reported).
   The language of the rule, however, has prevented its application
in cases where the accused is confined in a penal institution, but was
not actually "arrested" in the district where the institution is
located. It fails of application to any such individual until the
prisoner has completed his pending sentence and has thereafter
been taken into custody to answer an indictment or information
pending in another district. As a consequence, we have many out­
                                        31 

standing detainers filed against prisoners because of indictments
in districts other than where they are confined. Although many
defendants in this situation would gladly take advantage of Rule
20 if it were open to them, in the hope, I suppose, that any sentence
imposed would be made to run concurrently "vith those they were
serving, the rule is not available to them. This has an unfortunate
effect. Under the rules of the Board of Parole, the prisoner is
ineligible for consideration for parole release because of the out­
standing indictment and detainer. He becomes a greater custodial
risk. He must be removed to another district at Government ex­
pense. I would therefore like to urge a simple amendment of the
rule to cure the situation. I suggest that Rule 20 be amended by
substituting the words "held" and "is held" in the first sentt'mce of
the rule for the words "arrested" and "was arrested." The change
would be consistent with the present use of the word "held" in the
second sentence of Rule 20. As amended, the first sentence of the
rule would then read:
  A defendant held in a district other than that in which the indictment or infor­
mation is pending against him may state in writing, after receiving a copy of the
indictment-or information, that he wishes to plead guilty or nolo contendere, to
waive trial in the district in which the indictment or information is pending, and
to consent to disposition of the case in the district in which he is held, subject to
the approval of the United States attorney for each district.
   Pending legislation on criminal matters, which is of particular
interest to the Conference, concerns special treatment for youthful
offenders, counsel for indigent defendants, amendment of the im­
munity provisions of certain statutes, and changes in the Federal
jury system.
   For a number of years, as you know, legislation providing special
treatment and care for youthful offenders has been the subject of
serious consideration both by this Conference and by the Depart­
ment of Justice. A bill which would accomplish the purposes was
prepared by you in consultation with representatives of the Depart­
ment and others interested in the subject, and was introduced as
S. 2609. It has passed both Houses of Congress and was sent to
the President for approval on September 18,1950.
   The problem of legal representation of indigent defendants ac­
cused of crime in the Federal courts has been the subject of special
study by the Judicial Conference for several years. The Depart­
ment of Justice, for its part, has long advocated the creation of the
office of public defender in the Federal courts. We have strongly
                                 32 


recommended to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary the enact­
ment of S. 2206, which would achieve that objective. It appears,
however, that no action has been taken by that Committee with
respect to the bill.
   The provisions of certain statutes would be amended by H. R.
5136, so as to compel the testimony of witnesses, but affording im­
munity from prosecution regarding any matter as to which a witness
is compelled to testify after he specifically claimed the privilege
against self-incrimination. The Department of Justice has strongly
urged the enactment of this measure in the interest of law enforce­
ment, but up to the present time no action seems to have been taken
with respect to it.
   Two useful bills have been introduced in Congress relative to the
Federal jury system. H. R. 2050 would amend section 1864 of Title
28, U. S. C., to provide for a jury commission for each United States
district court. The bill has been approved by this Conference, and
the Department of Justice has stated that it would have no objec­
tion to its enactment. H. R. 2051 would amend section 1861 of
Title 28 to remove from the States any control over the qualifica­
tions of Federal jurors. The Conference has approved that pro­
posal also, and the Department of Justice likewise has indicated
that it has no objection to its enactment.
   In the field of admiralty, I would like to direct your attention to
the urgent need for revision of admiralty practice to bring it into
accord with modern Federal practice. Specifically, it is the view
of my Department, as the chief litigant in admiralty cases, that the
time is now ripe for appropriate action by the Supreme Court to
make available to the district courts in their admiralty practice the
modern procedural advantages of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro­
cedure.
   The Federal Civil Rules constitute a carefully detailed prescrip­
tion of Federal practice, the Federal Admiralty Rules do not. The
Admiralty Rules contemplate that they will be largely supple­
mented by reference to another body of law which, historically, has
been the reported decisions of the courts on practice points. But in
many cases those decisions on practice are long outmoded and em­
 body procedures which the Civil Rules were deliberately designed to
 abolish. At present in admiralty proceedings the courts, instead of
 supplementing the Admiralty Rules by resort to the modern Fed­
 eral practice embodied in the Civil Rules, must resort to the obso­
                                         33 

lete practice established by the practice decisions of the last cen­
tury.
   For example, the Civil Rules contain provisions as to the de­
tails of service and filing of pleadings and process (Rules 4 and 5),
the computation of time (Rule 6), and the approved manner of
pleading special matters and defenses (Rule 9). They carefully
detail capacity, joinder, and substitution of parties (Rules 17-25),
and the procedure for the taking of depositions (Rules 26-32).
They regulate in minute detail the procedure respecting orders,
judgments and decrees, their entry, effect and correction of errors
(Rules 54-63). With respect to nearly everyone of these matters
the Admiralty Rules are entirely silent. Thus, theoretically, there
is no conflict between the Rules of Admiralty and of Civil Pro­
cedure. But in supplementing the Admiralty Rules, conflicts
between civil and admiralty practice are engendered because ref­
erence is had, not to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but to
the old admiralty practice decisions.
   I do not believe that consolidation of the Admiralty and Civil
Rules is either necessary or desirable at this time. But the Civil
Rules, rather than old and often outmoded decisions, should be
made to supplement the admiralty practice established by the Fed­
eral Admiralty Rules to the extent that they are not inconsistent
with express provisions of those Rules. The need for action of this
sort has particularly been pointed out by the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit in the recent case of Marcado v. United
States, decided July 13, 1950. The occasion of the court's remarks
in that case was the matter of deposition practice-one of the nu­
merous difficult problems resulting from the repeal in the revision
of the Judicial Code of the statutes relating to various matters be­
lieved by the revisers to be fully covered by the Civil and Criminal
Rules. It was overlooked by the revisers that the Civil Rules do
not apply in admiralty except in certain district courts which have
adopted local rules to that effect. As the court said:
  T.o .our minds this case sh.ows the desirability .of making the civil rules directly
applicable in admiralty (with .of c.ourse such additions .on peculiar subjects, such
as limitati.on .of liability, as may be needed) with.out the c.onfusi.on and questi.on
which may f.oll.ow fr.om a rec.oPying .of parts.
    But aside from difficulties occurring as the result of the repeal of
various statutes by the revision of the Judicial Code, other difficul­
t.ies have also arisen in admiralty practice for which the Civil Rules
                                34 

afford a plain solution. Especially significant is the increasing ac­
cumulation of cases on the admiralty docket resulting from the
unavailability under the Admiralty Rules of a motion for summary
judgment and the efforts of some courts to solve the problem by
the appointment of commissioners. Also important are the
questions of partial appeals in cases involving mUltiple claims.
   Admiralty has no summary judgment procedure such as is pro­
vided by Civil Rule 56, permitting prompt disposition of actions
in which there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Ad­
miralty cases may remain on the docket for years when there is
no substantial controversy regarding the merits so that, if the legal
questions could be disposed of on motion, the parties would quick­
ly agree as to the amount of damages. The congestion of the ad­
miralty dockets has caused some courts to attempt to clear their
dockets by referring cases to commissioners. This in its turn has
raised a further difficulty resulting from the inapplicability in ad­
miralty of the Civil Rules.
   Civil Rule 53 (b) directs that "in actions to be tried without a
jury, save in matters of account, a reference shall be made only
upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it." No
such limitation exists in the corresponding Admiralty Rule 43.
Certain courts therefore assert the right to refer to commissioners
even admiralty suits by seamen for personal injuries, wages, and
claims for salvage. The result is highly undesirable from the
standpoint of proper judicial administration.
   Congress, having provided a number of judges which it deems
sufficient, has made no appropriation for the payment of fees to
commissioners and these must be taxed to the losing party as an
additional part of the costs in the case. The trial of cases before a
commissioner must, therefore, necessarily be far more expensive
and burdensome to litigants than trial before the court. Commis­
sioners are usually remunerated at a rate many times that of a
judge's salary. And not only the commissioner's fee but also the
stenographer's charges must be taxed against the losing party. In
trial before the court it is only occasionally that the stenographer's
notes must be fully transcribed. Considering the difficulties which
arise in the course of proceedings before a commissioner, it is nee­
essary in nearly every case before a commissioner for the entire
transcript to be written up for submission to the court, with
exceptions to the commissioner's report. So far as concerns the
                                 35 

attorneys, much of the work done before the commissioner must
be repeated before the court.
   But in seamen's cases, which form the numerical bulk of all
admiralty litigation, a special difficulty arises. Seamen, by virtue
of 28 U. S. C. 1916, proceed "without prepaying fees or costs or
furnishing security therefor." Thus the commissioner's only
chance for payment of his fee is by a decision in favor of the seaman,
to the end that the costs, including his fee, can be assessed against
the defending ship operator. A decision in favor of the Govern­
ment or any other ship operator would give the commissioners
only an empty right against a seaman without any assets subject
to levy. The resulting pressure on the commissioner cannot be
ignored.
   Yet in the face of these obvious defects in the commissioner pro­
cedure certain district judges, relying on the inapplicability in
admiralty of Civil Rule 53 (b), insist upon referring cases to
commissioners.
   There is every reason to believe that the members of the bar who
may be chosen to sit as commissioners will endeavor not to be
swayed by their financial interest in the matter. But it presents
them with a heavy burden on their time or a financial interest
which morally ought not to be imposed upon any man exercising
a judicial function. Indeed, where judges are concerned, 28 U. S. C.
455 expressly requires that a judge disqualify himself in any case
in which he has an interest. Supplemental resort to Civil Rule
53 (b), if it were permitted under admiralty rules, would obviate
the problem.
   The congestion of the docket also gives rise to a problem of ap­
peals from orders making final disposition of less than all of the
claims involved, where several claims for relief are presented in the
litigation-whether as separate claims of the party originally bring­
ing suit or as counter-claims, cross-claims, or claims against an
impleaded third party. When an order is entered disposing of a
part of the claims, there is at once a difficulty as to whether the
unsuccessful party must appeal or can wait until final disposition of
the entire litigation. Civil Rule 54 (b), as amended December 27,
1946, provides that the court may direct "entry of a final judgment
upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an ex­
press determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon
an express direction for the entry of judgment." Otherwise the
                                        36 

order "shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims" but
remains "subject to revision at any time before the entry of judg­
ment adjudicating an the claims." No such clarifying provision
exists in the Admiralty Rules.
   Out of abundant caution, Civil Rule 54 (b) not being applicable
in admiralty, a large number of partial appeals are taken, a sub­
stantial number of which are dismissed as improperly taken. A
new admiralty rule providing that the Civil Rules should be applied
would dispose of this problem and relieve the courts of appeal of
many partial appeals which would not need to be taken.
  I have gone into these details to point out not only the aggra­
vated background, but also the fairly simple solution it suggests.
This would be the adoption of a single additional admiralty rule
which would make the Rules of Civil Procedure the supplemental
source of decision in admiralty matters. Such a rule would be
similar to Bankruptcy General Orders 37 and 56 which makes the
Civil Rules a supplemental source of decision in matters of bank­
ruptcy practice. Adoption of such an admiralty rule could be
accomplished at once without the delays consequent upon the ap­
pointment of a committee on the general revision of the Admiralty
Rules. The results of the proposed rules' operation would soon
provide decisions on which to base action, as recommended by the
Second Circuit, looking toward a possible repeal of many of the
existing Admiralty Rules, which duplicate in part the Civil Rules,
and the possible eventual consolidation of the Admiralty with the
Civil Rules.
   In order to expedite study and solution of the problem, I am
submitting a proposed text of the suggested new admiralty rule,
which would come at the end of the existing rules, and would read
as follows:
  RULE 58. GeneraZ provisions.-In proceedings in admiralty the Rules of Civil
Procedure for the district courts of the United States shall, so far as they are not
inconsistent with these rules, be followed as nearly as may be. Each district
court, by action of a majority of the judges thereof, may from time to time make
and amend rules gOVerning its practice in admiralty proceedings not inconsistent
with these rules or with the Rules of Civil Procedure. Copies of rules and amend­
ments so made by any district court shall, upon their promulgation, be furnished
to the Supreme Court of the United States. In all cases not provided for by rule,
the district courts may regulate their practice in any manner not inconsistent
with these rules.
   At the same time it would appear necessary to make a slight
alteration of Rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which,
                                 37 

in paragraph (a) (1), now provides, among other things, that said
Civil Rules (Cdo not apply to proceedings in admiralty." I would
like to assure the Conference that the Admiralty specialists of the
Department of Justice will be available to assist, should it be de­
sired, in the further study and solution of the problem.
   Adverting now to some matters directly affecting the members of
the judiciary itself, it will be recalled that at the meeting of this
Conference last year, the creation of a number of additional judge­
ships was recommended. Bills to carry out those recommenda­
tions have been introduced, and considerable progress has been
made toward their enactment. H. R. 3775, to provide an additional
judge in the Third Division of Alaska, has been passed by the
House. Public Law 753 has made permanent the existing judge­
ship in the District of Delaware. Two additional judges have been
provided for the Northern District of Illinois by Public Law 691.
H. R. 6240, providing for one judge to serve in both the Northern
and Southern Districts of Indiana, has passed the House of Repre­
sentatives. H. R. 7009, to make permanent the existing temporary
judgeship in the Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri, has
also passed the House.        R. 7570, on the other hand, which would
have provided an additional judgeship in the Northern District of
Ohio, has failed of passage. The temporary judgeship in the West­
ern District of Pennsylvania has been made permanent by Public
Law 738. A bill eliminating the roving judgeship in the Eastern,
Middle, and Western Districts of Pennsylvania, and providing that
the roving judge should become a judge for the Middle District
when a vacancy occurs there, has passed the House and been
reported on in the Senate. H. R. 5137, providing an additional
judge in the Eastern District of Texas, has passed the House in
amended form, with the proviso that a vacancy occurring in the
office should not be filled.
   The Department of Justice has vigorously supported and taken
the lead in seeking the enactment of legislation to provide annuities
for widows and children of judges and justices. Several bills have
been proposed to accomplish these ends, among which the most
preferable would seem to be S. 3108 and H. R. 7593. The Senate
Judiciary Committee has reported favorably on S. 3108, with
amendments which are designed to give greater protection to sur­
viving minor children than was provided in the bill as originally
introduced J but the House Judiciary Committee has taken no action.
                                  38 

   In my report last year, I commented at some length on H. R.
2722, which would amend section 144 of Title 28 of the Code with
respect to the procedure for disqualifying a district judge for bias
or prejudice. I stated my opinion that the proposed amendment
was unnecessary and undesirable, and would hamper the work of
the Federal courts. This Conference also went on record against
the bilL I mention it now only to apprise you that, up to this time,
a House Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the measure,
but that no action has been taken as a consequence thereof.
   The adoption of uniform rules for all the courts of appeal, par­
ticularly with reference to the preparation and contents of printed
records and briefs on appeal, is a step which has been urged in re­
cent years by both Attorney General Clark and myself. The im­
portance of taking that step is, in my opinion, increasing. Once
again I call the recommendation to the attention of this Conference
and ask for its support.
   These are days, as we all know, when economy in operating the
Government is most important. In searching for possible ways to
reduce expenses, it has occurred to us that it might be permissible to
effect some reduction in the number of terms of court which are
held at outlying points and which are of not more than a few days
duration each. Such terms of court entail travel of the entire staff
of the court and, usually, of several representatives of the United
States attorney's and the United States marshal's offices, at Gov­
ernment expense, of course. It seems to me that, with modern
means of transportation, the number of these brief sessions in
sparsely populated areas could be reduced without unduly increas­
ing the burdens upon individual litigants who might be obliged to
proceed occasionally to the headquarters of the district. I therefore
suggest that this Conference give consideration to reducing the
number of such terms of court.
   Along the same lines of protecting the revenue, I·call your atten­
tion to the matter of taxation of marshal's costs against criminal
defendants under section 1921 of Title 28, U. S. C. While the law
leaves it in the discretion of the judge as to whether or not marshal's
costs shall be so taxed, in many districts it seems to be the invariable
rule not to tax such costs. This practice hardly appears warranted,
and undoubtedly results in an unnecessary financial loss to the Gov­
ernment, however small. It would be of value if the Conference
were to call this situation to the attention of the district judges.

   In concluding my report may I invite the attention of this body
to the fact that your administrative office, so ably presided over by
Mr. Henry P. Chandler, with the assistance of Mr. Elmore White­
hurst, celebrated its tenth birthday shortly after the close of the
last Judicial Conference. We in the Department of Justice have
had occasion to appreciate the high competence and generous as­
sistance of these two gentlemen and oftheir staff. I venture to hope
that they will be with us for a good many more years.
   I am appreciative, as always, of having had the opportunity to
report to you on these matters of serious concern to the adminis­
tration of justice in the Federal courts. Each of the matters, I
know, will receive your thoughtful attention. Working together,
as we have been, I am confident that notable progress will be made
in advancing and securing solutions for the many difficult problems.
