                                       RESOLUTION

  In the retirement of Chief Judge Learned Hand this Conference loses one of its
most distinguished, most useful, and most beloved members.
  For more than 40 years a member of the Federal judiciary, a wise and scholarly
jurist with rare powers of expression, he made mighty contributions to the pro­
gram of the law and strengthened the foundation of the Republic.
  As chief judge of one of the most important and busiest circuits of the Nation,
he kept his court abreast of the docket and furnished to all of us a brilliant
example of how an appellate court should function.
  As a member of this Conference, he gave wise guidance in its deliberations
and took profound interest in problems of administration throughout the
country.
  He is a judge of rare charm of personality and a wise and understanding
heart. We shall miss him at our meetings, but we trust that he may continue
to render judicial service for many years to come and that we may continue
to have his advice and assistance in the work of the Conference.
  The Conference welcomed Chief Judge Thomas W. Swan of the
Second Judicial Circuit as a member of the Conference, succeed­
ing Chief Judge Learned Hand, retired.
                    REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

  The Attorney General of the United States, Hon. J. Howard
McGrath, presented his report to the Conference. The full report
appears in the appendix.
            ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS

   Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts.-The Director submitted his twelfth annual report
reviewing the activities of his office for the fiscal year ended June
30,1951, including the report of the Division of Procedural Studies
and Statistics. The Conference ordered the report received, and
authorized its immediate release for publication. The Director was
authorized to incorporate statistical data not now available, and
to correct errors of a nonsubstantive nature in the printed edition
of the report to be issued later.
  1 For convenience. the Director of the Administrative Oftlce of the United States COllrts,
and the AdmlnistratiYe Office of the United States Courts are hereinafter referred to lIS
the Director, and the AdmlnlMratiYe Office. respectiYely.

                    BUSINESS OF THE COURTS

   State of the dockets of the Federal courts-Courts of appeals.­
Cases filed in the courts of appeals rose from 2,830 in the fiscal
year 1950 to 2,982 in 1951, an increase of 5.4 percent. About one­
fifth of the 1951 total came from administrative agencies, princi­
pally the Tax Court of the United States and the National Labor
Relations Board. Cases terminated were 153 less than the number
conunenced, leaving a pending caseload of 1,828 at the end of the
year. A somewhat more expeditious handling of the cases than
last year is indicated by the decrease of the median time interval
from the filing of the complete record to final disposition from 7.1
months in 1950 to 6.7 months in 1951. Half of the appeals were
decided in 1.5 months or less from the time of hearing or sub­
mission.
   The Fifth, Ninth, District of Columbia and Second Circuits, in
that order, received the greatest number of cases. The first three
named each had more than 300 cases pending on June 30, 1951,
and no other circuit had more than 150.
   Petitions to the Supreme Court for review on certiorari to the
United States courts of appeals were 600 compared with 663 peti­
tions docketed during the previous year. Of the number disposed
of, 76 were granted, a somewhat larger percent than last year, 502
were denied and 9 were dismissed.
   District courts.-The condition of the civil dockets of the dis­
trict courts is somewhat less favorable than last year. Since 1947,
the median time from filing to disposition of cases tried (excepting
as nontypical land condemnation, habeas corpus, and forefeiture
actions) has increased steadily from 9.0 months to the 1951 figure
of 12.2 months. During the same period the time from issue to
trial has gone from 5.1 months to 7.3 months. While actual con­
gestion of the dockets is largely confined to it few metropolitan
districts, other courts have also been under increased pressure,
indicating the need for the additional judgeships recommended by
the Judicial Conference as specified hereafter in this report.
   Civil cases commenced in the district courts in 1951 were about
6 percent less in number than in 1950. The decrease was almost
entirely due to a decline in cases brought by the United States.
Cases terminated were slightly above the number filed but this
was not true of private cases, where the pending caseload continued
to climb and reached a new high for more than a decade. The fol­

   Since 1941 the number of civil cases commenced annually has
increased by 34 percent while the number of district judges has
gone from 197 to 224, a rise of 14 percent. Private cases, which
constitute the heaviest part of the courts' business have risen by
47 percent. The result has been a longer period for disposition of                                        .,
contested cases. The number of total civil cases filed in the years                                       .,
from 1945 to 1947 was affected by the very large number of OPA
price and rationing cases brought by the Government in those
years.
   While the number of criminal cases filed in the fiscal year 1951
increased to 38,670 as compared with 36,383 in 1950, the increase
was entirely due to immigration cases filed in the 5 districts on
 the Mexican border. There were 14,965 of these cases and if they
are excluded from the totals in both years, there was a decrease
 of 8 percent in 1951. Criminal cases terminated exceeded the
 number begun and at the end of the year, the number pending
 was reduced to 7,701 of which over a fifth involved fugitive de­
fendants. Criminal cases are given priority and generally speak­
ing the criminal dockets are in excellent condition.
   Bankruptcy cases continued to increase in 1951, but in a much
smaller proportion than during the previous 4 years. The number
of cases filed was 35,193 compared with 33,392 in the fiscal year
 1950, an increase of 5 percent as compared with 28 percent in 1950
and 40 percent in 1949. Terminations of 32,647 cases although                                             0
below the number commenced, were 7,065 more than in 1950. The
pending caseloan at the end of the year increased to 40,922.
                                      5

       Serious congestion of the civil dockets is reported in the Southern
    District of New York, the District of New Jersey, the Eastern Dis­
    trict of Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, the Northern Dis­
    trict of Ohio and the Northern District of Illinois as well as
    considerable delays in the disposition of judicial business in a few
    other districts. Outside of seven metropolitan districts, the me­
    dian time from filing to disposition of cases tried was 10.1 months
    in 1951 compared with 9.6 months in 1950. The situation in the
    Southern District of New York remains critical. On June 30, 1951,
    there were 11,148 civil cases pending in that district which has 16
    jUdgeships. This is more civil cases than were pending on that
    date in all the district courts of the First, Fourth, Seventh, and
    Eighth Circuits with 58 district judgeships. At the end of the fiscal
    year, the assignment commissioner of the Southern District of New
    York estimated the time for reaching trial after the joinder of issue
    to be 29 months in jury cases, 23 months in nonjury cases and 30
    months in admiralty cases. This compares with a national median
    of 7.8 months in jury cases and 6.9 months in nonjury cases.
       Cases and motions under advisement.-The Conference reviewed
    the report of the Administrative Office with respect to cases and
    motions held under advisement for a period of more than 6 months
    as of June 30, 1951. Mr. Shafroth, chief of the Division of Pro­
    cedural Studies and Statistics informed the Conference that con­
    siderable progress had been made since the date of this report, and
    that the situation throughout was considerably more favorable at
    the present time.
       The Conference directed that whenever a case or motion is held
    under advisement for more than 6 months, the matter be brought
    to the attention of the judicial councils of the respective circuits
    involved with the view of expediting the disposition thereof inso­
    far as possible.
       General.-The Conference reviewed the state of the dockets, and
    the work of each of the district courts and courts of appeals. Con­
    ditions relating to the courts within each particular circuit were
    discussed by the chief judge of that circuit, and the Conference
    was informed of matters peculiar to such courts. Statistical data
    relating to the current and prospective business of the courts were
    presented by the Director. The attention of the Conference was

-   also directed to factors which were impossible to weigh in these
    data, but which had a material and substantial effect upon the
    dispatch of the courts' business. The prospects as to the avail­
                                           6


ability of judges for assignments outside their own districts dur­
ing the coming year were considered.
  It was the sense of the Conference that the following action
                                                                                             ,.!'

                         ApPROPRIATIONS

  Budget estimates and deficiency appropriations.-The estimates
of expenditures and appropriations necessary for the efficient
maintenance and operation of the United States courts, and the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts for the fiscal
year 1953, and appropriations covering estimated deficiencies for
the fiscal year 1952, were considered by the Conference.
  The Conference approved the estimates as submitted, and au­
thorized the Director to make any changes therein that may be
necessitated to provide for any additional expense that may be in­
curred due to the action of the Conference. The Director was
further authorized and directed to include in the regular and sup­
plemental estimates such sums as may be required to make appli­
cable to the personnel of the courts, any salary adjustments that
may be provided under any pay increase legislation that may be
enacted by the Congress.
             SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE CoURTS

   The report of the Committee on Supporting Personnel of the
Courts was submitted by its chairman, Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr.
   General-Salaries.-Chief Judge Biggs advised that the ques­
tion of a general salary increase for Government personnel had
     973984-51-2
                                  8

reached the point where it was now a matter for agreement by the
designated conferees of the two Houses of Congress; that while
there was no definite information, the general consensus of opinion
was that an agreement would be reached before the adjournment
of this session of the Congress, and that legislation providing for
some salary increases would be enacted.
   United States Commissioners-District of Columbia.-The Con­
ference upon consideration of the report of the committee with
respect of the recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the
District of Columbia that the United States Commissioner for the
District of Columbia be placed on a permanent fixed salary basis
and that he be furnished with adequate secretarial services at the
expense of the Government, directed that the Committee on Sup­
porting Personnel of the Courts make a further study of the pres­
ent system of operation of the offices of the various United States
Commissioners, with particular attention being given to the man­
ner and method of payment of the Commissioners and their per­
sonnel, the costs of office operations, and the manner in which
these expenses are being paid, and submit a report together with
such recommendations as the committee may deem desirable at
the next meeting of the Conference.
   United States Commissioners-Territory of Alaska-Deputy
Commissioners.-Chief Judge Denman submitted a resolution of
the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Judicial Circuit approving the
provisions of H. R. 3800, Eighty-second Congress, under which
a United States Commissioner in Alaska would be authorized to
appoint, with the approval of the district judge, a deputy com­
missioner; the compensation of such deputy to be paid from the
receipts of the office, and to be fixed by the district judge for the
division of the territory with the approval of the Director.
   Judge Denman briefly outlined the duties and functions of
United States Commissioners in Alaska. He pointed out that in
a substantial degree the duties falling upon this particular office
were peculiar to such office which in itself would, upon a fair com­
parison, definitely place it upon an entirely different plane from
such offices throughout the country. He recommended that the
Conference approve of the provisions of H. R. 3800 and urge its
prompt enactment by the Congress.
   The Conference thereupon approved of the enactment of legis­
lation that would authorize the appointment of Deputy United
                                                                        o

States Commissioners in Alaska under the terms and conditions
hereinabove recited, and expressed the hope that such legislation
would be enacted during the present session of the Congress. The
Director was instructed to advise the Congress of this action.
   United States Commissioners-Territory of Alaska-Maximum
compensation.-The Conference reaffirmed its previous recom­
mendation that the present statutory limitation with respect to
the amount of compensation that may be retained by these United
States Commissioners, who are paid from fees when earned, be
increased from $5,000 to $7,500 per annum.
   Law clerks and secretaries-Civil-service status.-The Confer­
ence reaffirmed its approval of legislation which will permit the
secretary, secretary-law clerk, or law clerk of any Federal justice or
judge who has served for 4 years and who has been separated from
the service involuntarily and without prejudice, to acquire a clas­
sified civil-service status for transfer purposes upon passing a non­
competitive civil-service examination.
   The Probation Service.-Officers and employees.-A general
discussion was had concerning the Probation Service with particu­
lar attention being given to the existing classification structure
throughout the whole service. Comparisons were presented with
the classification structure existing for comparable positions in
other agencies of the Federal Government, as well as salary ranges
prevalent in certain States. It was urged that in view of these
comparisons, as well as responsibilities upon the personnel of the
Service, an upgrading of certain of the probation officers and clerks
was warranted in order that these particular employees may re­
ceive a fair, as well as comparable, compensation for 'performing
duties similar in nature and with as high if not higher degree of
responsibility as those of employees in other agencies of the
Government.
   The Conference ordered that the question be referred to the Com­
mittee on the Supporting Personnel of the Courts, with a request
that a complete survey of the Probation Service be made with re­
spect to the adequacy and fairness of the existing classification
structure, and to submit a report together with recommendations
at the next meeting of the Conference.
   Court criers.-Reclassification.-Chief Judge Swan submitted
a proposal that the positions of court criers be resurveyed for the
purpose of ascertaining whether an upgrading in the existing classi­
                                 10 


fication thereof was warranted at this time. The Conference di­
rected that the matter be submitted to the Committee on Support-        II
ing Personnel of the Courts with request that necessary surveys
and studies be made covering the situation, and a report, together
with any recommendations, be submitted at the next meeting of
the Conference.
   Court of Appeals, District of Columbia-Clerk's Position-Re­
classification.-Chief Judge Stephens presented for the considera­
tion of the Conference a request for reconsideration of the question
of the reclassification of the position of clerk for the Court of Ap­
peals for the District of Columbia. The Conference, upon motion
made and carried, agreed to a reconsideration of the question.
Judge Stephens then briefly summarized the basis upon which the
proposal was previously considered, and brought to the attention
of the Conference additional factors that were either omitted from
the previous submission or had developed since the last survey of
the position was made.
   Upon motion made, duly seconded and carried, the Conference
authorized the reclassification of the position of clerk, Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, upgrading it from
its present classification of GS 13 to a classification of GS 14.       f'l
   District Court, District of Columbia.-Chief Judge Laws pre­
sented a proposal covering a general reorganization of the personnel
of the various offices of the District Court, District of Columbia.
He pointed out that such a reorganization had been contemplated,
and needed for a long period of time, but that submission thereof
for Conference consideration had been withheld due to the serious
space problems confronting the court. In view of the fact that
the court would soon be housed in the new court building and
adequate space would be available, it was felt that presentation of
the proposal at this time was timely. The proposal, as submitted,
covers reclassification, the establishing of new and additional posi­
tions and other personnel problems incident to a general reorgani­
zation program.
   The Conference directed that the proposal be submitted to the
Committee on Supporting Personnel of the Courts; that a survey
of the situation be made and that a report and recommendations
thereon be submitted at the next meeting of the Conference. The
Conference instructed the Director to assist the committee in any
way that the committee desired.                                         C
                                  11 

   Health service programs.-The Director called the attention of
the Conference to questions raised by the Public Building Service
of the General Services Administration with respect to whether
or not the Judiciary will participate for the personnel of the Dis­
trict Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, which will soon be
housed in the new Federal building at Nashville, Tenn., in a health
service program for employees in the building under the Statute,
5 U. S. C. 150.
   The Conference directed that the matter be referred to the Com­
mittee on Supporting Personnel of the Courts for consideration, and
a report and recommendations concerning the subject matter be
submitted at the next meeting of the Conference.
                          COURT REPORTERS

  Chief Judge John J. Parker, chairman of the committee on the
court reporting system presented the report of that committee,
which had been reactivated by order of the Conference in Septem­
ber 1950.
                              SALARIES

   Judge Parker informed the Conference that in accordance with
its direction, the Administrative Office had submitted to the com­
mittee for each court reporting position its recommendation of
the appropriate salary for the position, together with a compre­
hensive analysis, covering the 6 years since the system was estab­
lished and showing for each reporter the present salary and trans­
cript rates, changes and requests for changes made since the posi­
tion was established, the earnings of the reporter from salaries and
official transcript and nonofficial reporting work, the time he has
spent in court, the amount of transcript he prepares without fee,
comparisons of his present salary with those currently paid for simi­
lar work in the State courts, data regarding his office space, and the
extent of increase in the local costs of living since the present salary
was established. He also informed the committee that representa­
tives of the Conference of United States Court Reporters had
been heard by the committee and had presented requests for in­
creased compensation and for other changes in the administration
of the court reporting system at a meeting of the committee and
that the committee had ('onsidered these requests as well as the
 data and recommendations of the Administrative Office in arriv­
ing at its conclusions.
                                 12 

   He informed the Conference that the recommendations of the
Administrative Office and the report of his committee have been
distributed to the chief judges of the various districts, with a re­
                                                                         .1
                                                                         •
                                                                             1


quest that they report to the chief judges of their respective cir­
cuits any views regarding the compensation of reporters in their
courts that they might wish the Conference to consider.
   The report of the committee reviewed in general the origin of
the present system of compensation, observing that the salary scale
had been established originally in 1944 shortly after the enactment
of the statute authorizing the employment of the reporters, and
that the Conference at that time had no foundation of experience
upon which to base its action. Judge Parker pointed out that
the present study by the Administrative Office had provided
for the first time an opportunity for a thorough reexamination of
the salaries of every position based upon an exhaustive analysis of
the relevant facts in the light of a substantial period of experience.
The committee had considered that in fixing the salaries of court
reporters the Conference must preserve a reasonable relationship
between their compensation and that of the other highly respon­
sible and skilled supporting personnel of the courts, and it found
that although the rate of compensation for similar positions in the      _
State court systems is a pertinent factor for consideration in fix­
ing the salaries, yet, since the state salaries often depend upon
factors not found in the federal system and present on the whole a
more or less haphazard pattern, they cannot be followed absolutely
in the national service. But even from the local viewpoint, the
report indicated that in very few instances is the compensation of
the reporters below what it would have been if the reporters were
paid at the rate of $25 a day of actual reporting, which is, with
few exceptions, the highest rate paid throughout the country for
the services of per diem reporters.
   Accordingly the committee recommended to the Conference a
schedule of revised salaries for the Federal reporters which, with
certain exceptions, provided for increases of the salaries of the
$3,000 positions to $3,600 a year; of the $3,600 positions to $4,000
a year; of the $4,500 positions to $5,000 a year; and of the $5,000
positions to $5,500 a year. The exceptions to this were in positions
which the committee believed to be under classified on the basis of
the facts shown by the Administrative Office and so recommended
for larger increases than those shown by the scale given above, or,
                                                                         C.

r      in some few instances, in positions where the committee found no
4/1!   present basis for a salary increase.
          The Conference reviewed with care the salary schedule thus
       submitted, and the members of the Conference presented for the
       consideration and action of the Conference views transmitted to
       them by the district judges in reference to the positions in their
       respective courts. The Conference then approved in general the
       revised salary schedule as proposed by the committee in its report
       and, after making changes in the recommended salaries for posi­
       tions in some particular districts, it fixed the salary of each position
       as follows:

            The Conference instructed the Director to include in the regular
         budget for 1953 the amounts necessary to accomplish the salary in­
         creases thus approved and to seek a deficiency appropriation for
         the fiscal year 1952 sufficient to permit the new s~laries to be made
         effective after the appropriation is obtained, as of October 1, 1951.
            In his report, Judge Parker informed the Conference of the re­
         quests made by the representatives of the court reporters in refer­
         ence to their compensation when they appeared before the com­
         mittee.
""...,      Their request for an over-all increase of 20 percent in salary was
...,     considered by the Conference and disapproved.

                                 16 


   The reporters had also requested that the Conference endorse
the petition of the reporters to the Congress for legislation to pro­
vide that the cost-of-living increases allowed to other Government
                                                                        t
employees since 1944 be made applicable to the salaries of the court
reporters. Judge Parker's report pointed out in reference to this
that the salaries established in 1944 were established without ex­
perience to show what the total earnings from salaries and tran­
script would be, or how much of the reporters' time would be re­
quired for their official duties, and that the increases recommended
by the report appeared to bring the earnings from official tran­
scripts and salary to a rate which under present standards is com­
mensurate with the service actually furnished by the reporters.
The report also reminded the Conference that the salaries as they
are now increased are comparable to those paid in the executive
agencies to shorthand reporters employed under the civil-service
laws, who are required to work a 40-hour week and receive no
transcript fees. And it called the attention of the Conference to
the steady increases in earnings of the Federal court reporters from
official transcript that have occurred since 1944. In this connec­
tion it was observed that the Federal court reporters' compensation
is not limited to salaries, and ~hat under the law the positions do
                                                                        t:
not require a full-time 40-hour week, but that the reporters may
augment their salary income by the sale of official transcript and
the performance of private reporting work when they are not
needed for their official duties. In this respect they differ from
the other Government employees for whom the general pay acts
were designed.
   The Conference agreed that, taking these factors into considera­
tion for the positions involved, the higher living costs since 1944,
recognized for full-time Government employees by the various pay
acts of 1945, 1946, and 1948, are given sufficient weight in the
increases now approved by the Conference, and that this is also true
of the increased living costs involved in pending legislation. How­
ever, the Conference approved the recommendation of the com­
mittee that any changes in the salaries of Federal employees
authorized by Congress in future years to meet changes in the cost
of living should be made applicable to the salaries of the reporters
as they are now increased and fixed by the Conference.

                         TRANSCRIPT RATES

   Judge Parker reported that the court reporters who attended
the meeting of his committee had asked that the maximum allow­
able rate for original transcript at ordinary delivery be increased
from 55 cents to 65 cents. The committee recommended that
this request be not approved. Judge Parker again pointed out
that transcript earnings under the maximum limits approved by
the Conference in 1948 had increased on the average about 20
percent since that time. He reminded the Conference that one
of the primary purposes of the Congress in enacting the court
reporter law, and of the Judicial Conference in its administration,
has been to reduce and hold at the lowest possible level the costs
of litigation of which the transcript rates are a substantial part.
The Conference approved of the recommendation.
   The committee also reported that for the reasons stated above,
it recommended disapproval of the request of the reporters for the
removal of the present maximum of 90 cents for the original and
30 cents for copies for daily delivery transcript. The Conference
approved of the recommendation.
   In this connection, the committee observed that in multiple
judge courts some fortuitous inequalities of income from this source
to reporters serving in the same court arose from the differing work
assignments of the reporters. The committee found that a means
to avoid this situation was accomplished in several districts by
a voluntary system of pooling the transcript income and each of the
reporters in the district sharing therein upon a predetermined per­
centage basis. The committee suggested that this practice be com­
mended to the consideration of judges and reporters in other dis­
tricts where such conditions exist. The Conference approved of
this suggestion.
   Judge Parker also reported that representatives of the court
reporters had informed his committee that the use by attorneys
of the copies of transcript filed by them in the offices of the clerks
of court in compliance with the requirements of the statute
 (U. S. C., Title 28, sec. 753 (b)) had been the cause of unfair loss
of revenue to them because of its use without charge in situations
where otherwise copies would have been purchased from the re­
porters. They referred particularly to the use of this file copy for
purposes of appeal under Rule 75 (b) and (g) of the Federal Rules
                                  18 


of Civil Procedure. The committee had concluded that although
the file copy must be filed promptly with the clerk and made freely       0' 

available by him for reasonable public reference in his office, like
other papers in the case, yet if it is used for purposes of appeal the
reporters are justly entitled to a reasonable fee for that use.
   Accordingly, the Conference approved the recommendation of
the committee that provision may be made by the district courts
if they see fit that when the certified copy filed in the office of the
clerk pursuant to the act is used by the parties or their attorneys
in the preparation or perfection of appeals, they shall pay the re~
porter for that use a fee of 25 cents a page.
    REPORTS OF EARNING8--INCOME FROM PRIVATE REPORTING

  Judge Parker reported to the Conference the renewed objection
of the reporters, reiterated by them at the meeting of his com­
mittee, to the present requirement of the Conference that they
report to the Administrative Office their earnings from private
reporting work not connected with their official positions. He
said that the committee on the court reporting system had again
considered this objection and had concluded once more that for
the present the requirement should be continued. He pointed out
                                                                          O

                                                                           ·1




that in view of the part-time nature of the positions it is essential
for the Conference to know, in establishing salaries and official
transcript rates, the extent of the opportunities given each reporter
to engage in outside work, and that the reports of private earn­
ings, like the reports of time spent in court are important indices
of this factor. He observed also that these reports are not without
benefit to the reporters themselves, since they serve to correct any
impression that the outside earnings of reporters are generally
excessive.
   The Conference agreed with the view of the committee and in­
structed the Director to continue to require from the reporters
the usual quarterly reports of their earnings from private reporting.

                   BANKRUPTcY ADMINISTRATION

  The report of the Committee 'On Bankruptcy Administration
was submitted by Chief Judge Phillips, chairman. He informed
the Conference that pursuant to its direction the Director on
                                 19 

May 7, 1951, circulated among the circuit and district judges
(1) a copy of a bill introduced by Congressman Byrne (R. R. 1651,
82d Cong.) which if enacted would raise the maximum limit on
the salaries of full-time referees from $10,000 to $13,000 per annum
and on those of part-time referees from $5,000 to $6,500 per
annum; (2) a report of a special committee of the National Asso­
ciation of Referees in Bankruptcy recommending that all full-time
referees receive a fixed salary of $12,500 per annum and that part­
time referees receive salaries to be fixed by the Judicial Conference
at rates not exceeding $6,500 per annum; (3) a bill introduced by
Congressman Bolling (R. R. 3337, 82d Cong.) embodying the rec­
ommendations contained in the latter report; and (4) an estimate
prepared by Mr. Covey of the Bankruptcy Division of the increase
in the annual cost for salaries of referees which might be entailed
by the various proposals according to the action taken under them
by the Judicial Conference, and the relation of the increases to
the salary fund. The Director requested the circuit and district
judges, the judicial conferences and the judicial councils to express
their views upon the bills as well as upon the general question of
compensation of referees in bankruptcy.
   The chairman reported that the committee had before it the
letters expressing the views of the district judges and the circuit
conferences so far as they had acted upon the question. The
committee was of the opinion that in view of the steady increase
in the cost of living since the establishment of the salary system for
referees in 1947, especially in the metropolitan areas where many
of the full-time referees are located, the maximum limit upon sal­
aries of referees should be raised. The committee considered, how­
ever, that there were many districts in which it was desirable to
have full-time referees as at present but in which conditions would
not warrant the maximum salary. Consequently it did not favor
a fixed salary for all full-time referees.
   The chairman reported that the committee preferred the Byrne
bill and recommended its approval with an amendment fixing the
maximum limit on salaries of full-time referees at $12,500 per
annum and on those of part-time referees at $6,000 per annum,
both to be fixed by the Judicial Conference as at present. The
Conference approved the recommendation.

 CHANGES IN SALARY AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

  The committee recommended and the Conference approved the
following changes in referees' salaries, to be effective as of October
1,1951:
                                                                                         ...   ­

                         DISTRICT OF OREGON

   The committee recommended and the Conference approved the
following changes in the designation of places for the holding of
bankruptcy hearings in the District of Oregon: (a) Hillsboro to
be discontinued as a place of holding court for the referee at Port­
land; (b) Astoria, Tillamook, and The Dalles to be designated as
additional places of holding court for the referee at Portland; and
t c) Bend to be designated as an additional place of holding court
for the referee at Corvallis.
   The chairman reported that there had been brought to the
attention of the Committee a suggestion made by District Judge
J. Waties Waring of the Eastern District of South Carolina that
the procedure for the filling of vacancies in the office of referee
in bankruptcy be simplified so as to permit the appointment of
referees to fill vacancies in case of emergency. After considera­
tion the Committee recommended that no change he made in the
present procedure. The Conference concurred in the recom­
mendation.
   The committee recommended that the chairman of the com­
mittee be authorized in his discretion to appoint a subcommittee
from the membership of the committee to consider matters re­
ferred from time to time to the committee by the Judicial Con­
ference of the United States or by the Administrative Office. This
recommendation was approved.
                  OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM

  The report of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury
System was presented to the Conference by the chairman of the
                                  21 

committee, District Judge Harry E. Watkins, of West Virginia.
Upon the recommendation of the committee, the Conference re­
affirmed its endorsement of the proposed legislation recommended
by the Conference at previous sessions, to establish uniform quali­
fications for jurors (S. 19 and H. R. 3959, 82d Cong., 1st sess.) , and
to provide for a jury commission for each United States District
Court, to regulate its compensation, to prescribe its duties, and
for other purposes (S. 1684 and H. R. 4514, 82d Cong., 1st sess.).
   Judge Watkins also called to the attention of the Conference the
bill, H. R. 5254, of the Eighty-second Congress, dealing with jury
commissions in the district courts, and he reported that because
it eliminates the clerk of the court from participation in the work
of the commission, his committee recommended that the bill be
disapproved. The Conference recorded its disapproval of H. R.
5254, and instructed the committee so to inform the Congress.
   The committee also reported that as a result of its considera­
tion of H. R. 5254, it had concluded that in its opinion there is no
objection to those of its provisions which prescribe a form of oath
for jury commissioners, and which increase from 300 to 500 the
number of names of jurors required to be in the jury box when
a jury panel is drawn. The Conference agreed in this view and
authorized the committee to propose to the Congress appropriate
drafts of legislation in the premises.
   The committee also reported that it had under consideration
a proposal made by District Judge Alfred D. Barkdale of Virginia
that the number of persons necessary to constitute a grand jury
be reduced to not less than ten nor more than fourteen, with eight
votes required for an indictment. The Conference authorized the
committee to continue its study of this subject and to report its
conclusions to the Conference.
   Federal grand juries-Investigatory power.-The Chief Justice
brought to the attention of the Conference a letter directed to him
by the Hon. Franck R. Havenner, Member of Congress, House of
Representatives, from the Fourth Congressional District of Cali­
fornia, concerning a communication and resolution which he had
received from the Association of Grand Jurors of the city and
county of San Francisco, Calif., with respect to the investigatory
power and authority of Federal grand juries. The attention of
the Conference was also directed to a bill [So 2086] relating to
the subject matter which had been introduced in the Senate on
August 31, 1951.
                                       22 


  The Conference directed that the matter be referred to the Com­
mittee on the Operation of the Jury System for study and recom­
mendations, and that a report thereon be submitted at the next
meeting of the Conference.
  Jury commissioners-District of Columbiar-Compensation.­
Chief Judge Harold M. Stephens presented for the consideration
of the Conference a proposal to amend existing law which limits
the maximum amount of compensation which a jury commissioner
in the District of Columbia may receive in anyone year to $250, so
that such maximum amount would be increased to $600 per year.
  It was pointed out that this amendment had been sought for
many years, and that it has the wholehearted approval of the
District Court. Judge Stephens stated that all of the jury com­
missioners in the District of Columbia were spending a great deal
more time on their duties than they can be compensated for under
existing law, and that this increase in the maximum allowable
compensation per annum would in a very small measure be a
recognition of their valuable services.
   The Conference approved of the proposal and recommended
that section 198 of the act to establish a Code of Law for the
District of Columbia, approved March 3, 1901, and the Acts
amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto, constituting the
Code of Law for the District of Columbia, as amended (D. C. Code
1940 Ed. § 11-1401) be further amended by striking therefrom the
following words: "(nor two hundred and fifty dollars per annum)".
   The Director was instructed to advise the Congress of this action
and to request that the proposed amendment be enacted promptly.
                             CoURTS-GENERAL

   Controversie8 arising under the antitrust law8, and actions of
regulatory agencies-Procedure.-Circuit Judge E. Barrett Pretty­
man, chairman, presented the report of the Committee of the Con­
ference designated to consider:
   (1) Means whereby the proceedings of regulatory agencies may be sbaped
both to satisfy the needs of the parties and to facilitate the reviewing function
of the courts;
   (2) Means whereby at nisi prius particular evidence may be explicitly related
to defined issues and all of the evidence on a particular issue presented together;
   (3) Means whereby (n) the materials in the record are confined to the issues
under review by preparation of the record after points for arguments have been
exchanged between the parties and bY any other means devised for delimiting
such, and (b) such materials are marshalled in a form most helpful for their
consideration;
  (4) And all other modt's by which the general ends berein indicated may be
achieved.
    Judge Prettyman reviewed the manner followed in organizing
the work of the committee, and the developments incident to evolv­
ing a program for carrying out the purposes for which the commit­
tee was designated. It was stated that after completion of its pre­
liminary organizational work. the committee was of the unanimous
opinion that, because of the importance of its task, the breadth and
scope of its assignment, and the complexities of the many problems
incident to such an undertaking, it would be an advisable step to
segregate its work into two phases-one dealing primarily with
prevalent procedures and methods of improvement therein before
judicial tribunals, and one dealing with existing procedures and
methods of improvement therein before administrative tribunals.
    In view of this determination, the chairman sought, and received,
authority from the Chief Justice of the United States and chairman
of the Judicial Conference of the United States, to designate a sub­
committee on administrative procedures as an advisory committee
to the Committee of the Conference. And, pursuant to this authori­
ty, he had established, by designation, such an adYisory committee
 composed of representatives of the administrative agencies of the
Federal Government, t,he general counsels of such agencies and
members of the legal profession.
    A detailed and comprehensive presentation of the reports and
work of the two committees was submitted by Judge Prettyman.
He stated that the report and recommendations of the Advisory
Committee because of their consistency with the over-all objectives
sought had been approved and adopted by the Committee of the
Conference. He advised that such reports and recommendations
had been distributed to aU of the judges of the Federal judiciary
and that the comments which had been received were all favorable
to the views expressed with reference to procedures before judicial
 tribunals. Due to the fact that the work of the committee had
been divided into two phases, Judge Prettyman proceeded to sub­
mit the conclusions and recommendations of the comrnitt€e sepa­
rately:
               PROCEDURE BEFORE JUDICIAL TRIBUNALS

                              CONCLUSIONS

  1. That unnecessary delay, volume of record, and expense in
judicial proceedings constitute an obstruction to the administra­
     973984-51--4
                                 24 


tion of justice; that such delay, volume and expense occur in a suffi­
cient number of cases to constitute a serious problem.
   2. That prevention of these conditions depends upon a fixed
determination on the part of judges to prevent them and a firm
course of action to that end.
   3. That the most effective means of preventing unnecessary de­
lay, volume of record, and expense are:
   (a) conferences between judge and counsel prior to trial, such
conferences to be of a style and scope to meet the peculiar needs of
the particular case;
   (b) the exclusion from the record of all unnecessary, as well as
all irrelevant and incompetent, matter; and
   (c) a course of procedure which will minimize delay in the ac­
curate disposition of the cause after the completion of the trial.
   Specific methods meeting with the approval of the committee for
these purposes are set forth in the report of the committee.

                         RECOMMENDATIONS

  1. That this report be accepted and approved by the Judicial
Conference as a committee report.
   2. That the report be printed, in form and style usable for ready
reference by judges and trial counsel; for example, in the style and
form customary in briefs in appellate courts.
   3. That copies of the report, together with copies of the approv­
ing resolution of the Conference, be supplied to the judges of the
district courts and circuit courts of appeals.
   4. That copies of the report and the resolution of approval of the
Conference be forwarded to the chairmen of the Judiciary Commit­
tees of the Senate and House of Representatives.
   5. That the Administrative Office be instructed to make avail­
able copies of the report to practicing lawyers, and to organiza­
tions thereof, upon appropriate terms.
   6. That the Administrative Office be instructed to give publicity
to the report in such manner as the Director may deem appropriate,
to the end that its existence and terms come to the attention of
practicing lawyers generally; for example, through the media of
 bar journals and law school publications.
,.               PROCEDURE BEFORE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

       The chairman, Judge Prettyman, read from the report of the
     Advisory Committee on Procedure before Administrative Agencies
     the following excerpts:
       On June 30, 1950, your Advisory Committee initiated a first-hand investigation
     of the causes of excessive delay and expense and unduly voluminous records
     in the procedures of Federal regulatory agencies, and possible remedies therefor.
     Each member of the Committee conducted such an inquiry among the members
     and staff of one such agency, and among the attorneys practicing administrative
     law before it. Consideration was given to the views expressed by members of
     the American, the District of Columbia and Federal Bar Associations. On
     the basis of these investigations, findings have been made and recommendations
     formulated.
                                             I

        Importance of the problem.-The Advisory Committee finds that for some time
     a number of Federal regulatory agencies have been making earnest efforts to
     eradicate from their administrative practice the causes hindering the expedi­
     tious adjudication of their proceedings. It has been found further, however,
     that although the problems here under consideration have been partially solved
     in some agencies, they still remain as continuIng major difficulties in the over­
     all administrative procedures of the Federal Government. In fact, unduly volu­
     minous records and unreasonable delay constitute a hindranc-e to the
J"   success of the administrative process and to the effective administration of jus-
Jy   tice by regulatory agencies. It is with respect to this type of lengthy hearing
     and unduly bulky record that the observations and recommendations of the
     Advisory Committee are made.
       The contributing causes of these difficulties vary from proceeding to proceed­
     ing, and from agency to agency. In fact, the responsibility for these causes
     must be shared to some degree by the courts, the administrative agencies, the
     hearing examiners, and by counsel for all parties, public and private. Neces­
     sarily, the remedies for the causes must also vary, Accordingly. no attempt
     has been made to specify any cause as the principal one, nor any remedy as uni­
     versally applicable, or as a complete and final solution for all the problems here
     considered.
                                            II

       Administrative Agenc'y Oonference.-The procedure of the administrative
     ngencies, pursuant to acts of Congress, is primarily a matter for the executive
     branch of the government. In the final analysis, it would be inappropriate and
     impractical for the Judicial Conference [of the United States] to attempt to
     formulate and promulgate uulform rules for the guidance of the Federal regu­
     latory agencies. The regulatory agencies themselves must solve this problem.
     The solution may best be accomplished by the cooperation of all agencies in­
     volved; in fact, a cooperative approach, with mutual exchange of experience
     and suggestions, seems imperative for the most efficient functioning of the ad­
     ministrative agencies. With such an approach to this problem iu mind, your
     committee's primary recommendation is that the Judicial Conference suggest
     to the President that he call, or cause to be called, a Conference of Representa­
                                      26 

Uves of the Administrative Agencies having adjudicatory and substantial rule­
making functions, for the purpose of devising ways and means for achieving the
objectives with which this committee is concerned: that Is, of preventing un­
necessary delay, expense, and volume of records in administrative proceedings
and of improving generally the efficiency and economy of the administrative
process, and that particular attention be given to each factor of the problems
llerein outlined. It is further suggested that such Conference might establish
a procedure for a continuous exchange of views and a review of progress relating
to these objectives at regular intervals.
   A brief resume of the Advisory Committee's conclusions and sug­
gestions by Judge Prettyman followed. It was emphasized that
although the committee had reached some rather definite conclu­
sions with respect to the manner in which improvements could be
obtained in the saving of time, reduction of costs, and the acceler­
ation of disposition through the establishment of certain proce­
dures, it was the consensus of opinion of both the Advisory Com­
mittee and the Committee of the Conference that the problem in­
volved is primarily one for the departments and agencies of the
Government to consider, and that a cooperative approach to the
situation would afford the most feasible medium through which a
practicable solution may evolve.
   Upon consideration, the Conference ordered that the committees'
suggestions and recommendations with respect to the call of a
Conference of Representatives of the Administrative Agencies hav­
ing adjudicatory and substantial rule-making fUllctions, be ap­
proved with this additional recommendation:
That representatives from the Federal Judiciary and the Bar as may be desired
be designated to attend said Conference and to serre in such capacity as the
PresIdent may determine.
   Thereupon, the Conference approved the reports and recom­
mendations of the committee as amended. It directed that the
full reports of the committees be incorporated in the report of this
Conference meeting by reference. It further directed that the
Director should make arrangements for a special printing of the
report and for its distribution to all members of the Federal judi­
ciary, with special attention being called to the favorable attitude
of the Conference with respect to the recommendations submitted.
The Director was instructed to make available copies of the reports
for distribution to those that may desire them; that such distri­
bution shall be made upon request directed to the Director and
upon such terms as he may deem necessary.

          DISTRICT COURTS--VENUE AND JURISDICTION

   Chief Judge Parker, chairman of the committee appointed to
study the venue and jurisdiction of the district courts of the United
States reported to the Conference the conclusions and legislative
recommendations of his committee. He informed the Conference
that the comprehensive report presented to it by his committee in
March 1951 had been circulated throughout the judiciary in ac­
cordance with the directions of the Conference and had been con­
sidered by the circuit conferences of the First, Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits. Following
receipt of the reactions of the judges and of the conferences, the
committee had met again to consider its previous report in the light
of these comments. The committee had then reviewed the recom­
mendations of its previous report and concluded to adhere to all of
them except the one which would foreclose to corporations the
Federal jurisdiction in cases based upon diversity of citizenship in
States where they are doing business and from which they receive
more than half their gross income. As to this recommendation,
the committee had concluded to follow a recommendation of the
Tenth Circuit, which would substitute for the formula based upon
net income, the standard specified in the jurisdictional sections of
the Bankruptcy Act (U. S. C., Title 11, § 11) which rests the matter
upon the principal place of business of the corporation, and it pre­
sented to the Conference a draft of legislation to accomplish this
purpose by amendment of United States Code, Title 28, section
1332. Accordingly the committee recommended that the Con­
ference approve its four recommendations as follows:
   (1) That the historic jurisdiction based upon diversity of cit­
izenship be retained in the Federal courts.
   (2) That section 1332 of the Revised Judicial Code be amended
to provide that in cases based upon diversity of citizenship a cor­
poration shall be deemed a citizen both of the State of its creation
and the State in which it has its principal place of business, and
that its recommended draft of a bill to accomplish this purpose
be approved.
   (3) That the jurisdictional amounts prescribed by sections 1337
and 1332 of the Revised Judicial Code as requisite for Federal
jurisdiction in cases based upon diversity of citizenship or a Federal
question be raised from $3,000 to $7,500.
                                      28 

   (4) That no change in the law dealing with the transfer of cases
for trial of the nature proposed by legislation now before the                     1,'
Congress be made in section 1404 of the Judicial Code and that
bills to accomplish such a change be disapproved.
   After considerable discussion the Conference approved of the
reports and recommendations of the committee and authorized
the committee to be of any possible service to the Congress in its
consideration of the legislative changes proposed.

 DISTRICT COURTS-CONDEMNATION CASES-METHOD OF TRIAL

   It was reported to the Conference that there was pending in the
House of Representatives a bill (S. 1958, 82d Cong.), already
passed by the Senate, which would require the district courts in
condemnation cases to provide a trial by jury of the issue of just
compensation upon the demand of any party, notwithstanding the
provisions of subdivision (h) of Rule 71A of the Rules of Civil
Procedure, which was recently promulgated by the Supreme Court
and became effective on August 1, 1951, and which permits the dis­
trict court in its discretion to order this issue to be tried by three
commissioners when the character, location, or quantity of prop­
erty to be condemned or other reasons in the interest of justice
make preferable that method of trial. It was the view of the Con­
ference that the new Supreme Court rule should not be thus modi­
fied by legislation until the courts have an opportunity to study
the proposal, formulate their views, and express them to Congress.
   Accordingly the Conference adopted the following resolution:
  Whereas rule 71A of the Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the exercise of
the power of eminent domain under a law of the United States was recom­
mended by the Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Rules of CivU Procedure,
of which former Attorney General, the Hon. William D. Mitchell, is chairman,
and was adopted by the Supreme Court after the most careful study and con­
sideration; and whereas there has been introduced into the Senate of the United
States a bill, S. 1958, which will modify subdivision (h) of this rule so as to
take away the discretion reposed in district judges with respect to the manner
of determiuing the issue of just compensation and to require jury trials in all
cases where demanded by either of the parties, notwithstanding that the judge
may be of opinion that such method of trial is not in the interest of justice
because of the character, location, or quantity of the property to be condemned
or for other reasons; and whereas said bill has been passed by the Senate with­
out giving the courts an opportunity to be heard with regard thereto but has
not been passed by the House; and whereas legislative modifications of a rule of
procedure adpoted by the Supreme Court should be undertaken only after the
most careful consideration and with opportunity on the part of the courts to be
heard with regard to the matter­
                                             29 

        Now, therefore, be it Re8oZved: That a committee of the Conference be ap­
      pointed to give study to the change in the rule that will be accomplished by S.
      1958, seek the advice of the United States judges and circuit councils, and report
      to the Conference with respect thereto at the meeting in the spring of 1952, so
      that the Conference may express to Congress its considered views as to the
      desirability of the proposed change in the rule; and that in the meantime the
      Conference ask Congress to withhold action on the proposed legislation until
      the study can be made and the Conference can have opportunity to express its
      views.
         The Director was instructed to transmit this resolution to the
      appropriate officers of the Congress.
         Deceased or deserting seamen-Method of disposing of wages
      and effects of-District Judge William C. Coleman, chairman of
      the Conference Committee designated to consider some more satis­
      factory method of dealing with wages and effects of deceased or
      deserting seamen than that presently provided for under existing
      law advised that the committee's report and recommendations had
      been circulated throughout the judiciary in conformity with Con­
      ference policy; that of the judges commenting thereon an over­
      whelming majority favored the proposals. He advised that upon
      further consideration, the committee proposed to amend its recom­
,..   mendation with respect to the maximum value of deceased sea­
j"    men's wages and effects up to which formal administration of the
      deceased seaman's estate is not required before distribution, by
      changing the maximum amount of $500 heretofore proposed to
      $1,000.
         Judge Coleman stated that a special committee of the Maritime
      Law Association had been heard and their views were fully con­
      sidered by the Conference Committee and, further, that such special
      committee was opposed to the recommendations of the Conference
      Committee.
         The Chief Justice called the attention of the Conference to the
      Report of the Committee of the Maritime Law Association of the
      United States on the Disposition of Wages and Effects of De­
      ceased and Deserting Seamen, a copy of which report had been
      furnished to each member of the Conference. He also read a let­
      ter from Mr. Vernon S. Jones, chairman of this committee, voic­
      ing its opposition to the recommendations proposed by the Con­
      ference Committee.
         The Conference thereupon entered upon consideration of the
      committee's recommendations. As stated by the committee, the
      basic proposed amendment to existing law is to effectuate the
                                      30 


transfer of the custody and administration of the wages and effects                 ~.
of deceased or deserting seamen from the district courts to the                     ..J)
Coast Guard through the implementation of the Administrative
Procedure Act, preserving a right of review in the district courts.
   Each of the procedural steps proposed, and each of the amend­
ments to existing law were reviewed and discussed by the Con­
ference.
   Whereupon, the Conference approved of the report and recom­
mendations of the committee, as amended, and instructed the
Director to advise the Congress of this action and to request that
the proposed legislation be enacted as promptly as possible.
   Judges-Retirement of.-Circuit Judge F. Ryan Duffy, chair­
man of the Conference Committee appointed to study and
report with recommendations with respect to problems relating to
the retirement of judges for age or disability, seniority status,
designation and assignment and personnel assistance for retired
judges, and other problems which in the discretion of the committee
were relevant to its study of the subject matter, submitted the re­
port and recommendations of the committee.
   It was pointed out that the committee had not submitted recom­
mendations concerning matters relating to the retirement of judges                  ~'i 

in the Territorial courts inasmuch as it had not had an opportunity
to consider expressions which had been received only a short time
before the date of the Conference. He advised that the committee
would deal with this in the near future and a report and recom­
mendations thereon would be presented promptly.
   The Conference directed that the report be received and cir­
culated throughout the judiciary in order that the views and ex­
pressions of the district and circuit judges with respect thereto
could be ascertained, and that a further report from the committee
be submitted at the next meeting of the Conference.
   Felony-Statutory definition oj.-Chief Judge Parker, chair­
man of the Committee on Punishment for Crime which had been
directed to consider and make recommendations with respect to the
following resolution of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Judi­
cial Circuit:
  Re8olved: That paragraph (1) of section 1 of Title 18 of the United States
Code be amended by the addition thereto of the following:
  "Provided, That when a person is convicted of any felony and the sentence
imposed by the court does not provide for imprisonment for a term exceeding 1
year, such person shall, for all purposes, after the judgment of conviction shall
                                      31 

have become final and after the sentence imposed upon him shall have expired,
be deemed to have been charged with and convicted of a misdemeanor, and such
person shall not suffer any disability or disqualification which would otherwise
result from a conviction of a felony."
presented a report of the committee. He informed that the report
and recommendations of the committee which had been submitted
at the spring meeting of the Conference had been circulated
throughout the judiciary in conformity with the policy of the Con­
ference. He stated that the reaction was very favorable in a ma­
jority of instances, and that, upon consideration of those objec­
tions which had been received, the committee had determined
that they were not of sufficient consequence to alter the committee's
position.
   Upon consideration, the Conference approved the recommenda­
tions of the committee to the effect that paragraph (1) of sec­
tion 1 of Title 18, be amended in accordance with the proposals
submitted by the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Judicial Cir­
cuit. The Director was instructed to advise the Congress of this
action, and to request that the necessary legislative action be taken
as promptly as possible to enact into law the suggested statutory
amendment.
   Probation-Imposition of jail sentence as a condition of.-Chief
Judge Phillips stated that pursuant to directions of the Conference
the committee had considered the resolution of the Ninth Circuit
Judicial Conference proposing that section 3651, Title 18, United
States Code, be amended "to provide that the court shall have
power in granting probation to defendants in criminal cases to
impose as a condition of probation that the defendant be impris­
oned in a jail-type institution for a period not exceeding 6 months"
and had unanimously concluded that such amendment was not
desirable, and therefore recommended against its being proposed
for legislative action. Upon consideration, the Conference con­
curred in and adopted the views of the committee.
   Courts-Clerks' offices-Closing of certain.-The Director called
the attention of the Conference to a statement of the Appropria­
tions Committee of the House of Representatives, which is set
forth in its report to the House on the annual appropriations for
the fiscal year 1952 CH. Rept. 685, 82d Cong., p. 21), and which
reads as follows:
  Examination of the hearings will disclose that United States District Court
clerks' offices are maintained at several locations at which a total of less than
                                        32 

50 cases (civil and criminal combined, but excluding bankruptcy and naturali­
zation) were commenced during the fiscal year 1950. It is felt that the locations    ~
of these offices should be carefully examined and that all unnecessary offices       ,...J)
should be eliminated.
In the consideration of the subject matter, it was pointed out that
this question had heretofore been urged for consideration by the
judges of the districts wherein there are offices at outlying places
with a very small volume of business, and that it was a matter of
especial comment by the Conference Committee on Ways and
Means of Economy in the Operation of the Federal Courts.3 How­
ever, because of the pointed reference to the situation as herein­
above recited, the Conference instructed the Director to have the
matter brought to the special attention of the district judges in
whose districts clerks' offices falling within the classification de­
scribed are located, with the request that they give earnest consid­
eration to the necessity for the continued operation of such offices.
   Courts-Discretionary allowance of appeals from interlocutory
orders, judgments and decrees in certain instances.-Chief Judge
Swan brought to the attention of the Conference a suggestion sub­
mitted by Circuit Judge Frank that a committee be appointed to
consider a proposed new statute, to be known as section 1292A,
of Title 28, United States Code, which would authorize the courts                    ~) 

of appeals to permit, in their discretion appeals from interlocutory
orders, judgments or decrees in certain instances. As a basis for
such committee's study, Judge Frank suggested the following:
   In addition to appeals from interlocutory orders, judgments and decrees per­
mitted as of right under section 1292, a court of appeals, on the application of a
party, may In its discretion authorize an appeal from an interlocutory order,
judgment or decree if such court determines that such authorization is necessary
or desirable to avoid substantial Injustice. Any such application must be made
within 30 days after the entry of the order, judgment or decree. No appeal will
lie from any interlocutory order, judgment or decree in bankruptcy except as
provided In this section or section 1292. Failure to take or apply for an appeal
under t11ls section or section 1292 shall not bar an appeal from any order, judg­
ment or decree when it becomes final.
A statement with respect to Judge Frank's proposal by Judge
Charles E. Clark was also presented.
  The Conference directed. that the matter be referred to the
committee authorized to be designated by the Chief Justice to
study legislation which has been proposed in the Congress with
reference to procedures in condemnation cases. The committee
  • Rpt. Jud. Conf., Sept. 1948, pp. 34-85.
                                           33 

     was requested to make a study of the proposal, and to submit its
     report and recommendations as promptly as possible.
       Pretrial procedure.-Chief Judge Phillips, at the request of
     Circuit Judge Alfred P. Murrah, presented the report of the Com­
     mittee on Pretrial Procedure.
       The Conference expressed its approval and satisfaction with the
     progress that is being made in the task of making more widespread
     the use of pretrial procedural methods throughout the Federal
     judiciary. It noted with interest the fact that such methods have
     been adopted in many of the various State courts.
       The Conference directed that the report of the committee be
     received and approved, and that it be brought to the attention
     of the various district and circuit judges.
        District judges-Representation on Judicial Conference.-Pur­
     suant to request of Chief Judge Denman, the Conference heard
     Chief District Judge James Alger Fee of the District of Oregon,
     who presented the views of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
     Judicial Circuit concerning personal representation of district
     judges on the Judicial Conference of the United States. After
     consideration, Chief Judge Denman, at the request of Judge Fee,
     presented the following motion:
       That a committee be appointed by the Chief Justice to consider the question
     of representation of District Judges on the Judicial Conference of the United
     States, with special attention being given to the proposal approved by the
     Judicial Conference of the Ninth JUdicial Circuit whereby it suggests that
     existing law with respect to membership of the Conference be amended so that
     the District Judge senior in commission in each circuit will be included therein.
       The motion was rejected.
       Thereupon, the following motion was presented and considered:
       That a committee be appointed by the Chief Justice to consider the relations
     of the District Judges with the Judicial Conference of the United States and
     the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, with special attention
     being given to the views expressed in the recommendation of the Ninth Judleial
     Circuit Conference.
       The motion was disapproved.
       Judges-Territorial courts-Tenure.-Judge Denman presented
     the suggestion of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Judicial
     Circuit that section 134 (a) of Title 28 of the United States Code
     dealing with the district judges in Hawaii and Puerto Rico be
     amended to eliminate the present limitation of terms to six and
     eight years respectively and instead to provide for tenure during
..   good behavior.
                                         34

   Upon consideration, the Conference directed that the question
of tenure of service for judges of all the Territorial courts be re­
ferred to the Committee on Retirement, Tenure, etc., for study,
and to submit a report and recommendations thereon at the next
meeting of the Conference.
  Courts-Expert witnesses called by the court--Compensa­
tion.-Chief Judge Magruder presented the following resolution
adopted by the Judicial Conference of the First Judicial Circuit:
  Resolved: That it was the consensus of the conference held on June 19, that
the Judicial Conference of the United States be requested to appoint a commit·
tee to consider whether statutory authority should be given to federal judges
to compensate, at rates appropriate for expert witnesses, experts called by the
Court itself in civil litigation to testify with respect to economic, professional,
or other technical matters upon which the court desired disinterested expert
testimony.
   The Conference approved of the resolution, and directed that
a committee of the Conference be designated by the Chief Justice
for such purpose, and that report and recommendations be sub­
mitted by such committee as promptly as possible.
   Revision of criminal and judicial codes.-Circuit Judge Albert
B. Maris, chairman of the committee, submitted its report. Judge
Maris gave an interesting resume of his work in connection with                        ~
the formulation of legislation to be enacted by the Guam Legisla-                      ~'
ture to reorganize the judicial system, and, as an incident thereto,
to investigate the existing judicial system and to make recom­
mendations for its improvements. In this connection, Judge Maris
urged the Conference to approve an amendment t{) section 1291
of Title 28, United States Code, which was pending in the Con­
gress whereby all final decisions of the District Court of Guam
shall be appealable to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial
Circuit. The Conference thereupon adopted the following
resolution:
   Resolved: That the Judicial Conference of the United States approves the
amendment of section 1291 of Title 28, United States Code (into which the pro­
visions of sec. 23 (a) of the Organic Act of Guam are being incorporated by
H. R. 3899, sec. 48) so as to provide that all final decisions of the District Court
of Guam shall be appealable to the Court of Appeals.
  The Conference directed that the report of the Committee on the
Revision of Criminal and Judicial Codes be received and approved.
  Judicial statistics.-Mr. Will Shafroth, Chief of the Division of
Procedural Studies and Statistics, Administrative Office, presented                    ....,
the report of the committee. He briefly outlined the work of the
                                 35 

committee since its last report. The Conference directed that the
report be received and approved, and that it be circulated through­
out the judiciary for the information of the judges.

                            COMMITTEES

   Committees continued and discharged.-All present committees
of the Conference were ordered continued with the exception of the
following which were ordered to be discharged:

Rule 71A of the Rules of Civil Procedure that will be accom­
plished under the provisions of S. 1958 of the Eighty-second Con­
gress which has passed the Senate and is pending in the House of
Representatives. This has particular reference to the method of
trial with respect to the question of just compensation in con­
demnation cases.
    Pursuant to such directive, the Chief Justice designated the fol­
lowing as a committee of the Conference for the purposes indi­
cated, which are more fully set forth in the resolution of the Con­
ference appearing on page 28 of this report.

                               APPENDIX
    REPORT OF HON.    J.   HOWARD MCGRATH, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
                            THE UNITED STATES

    Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference of the
         United States, Honored Guests:
       When I was privileged to address this Conference a year ago,
    I expressed the firm conviction that the administration of justice
    is confronted today by few responsibilities that equal, in urgency
    and complexity, the preservation of our fundamental individual
    liberties while at the same time the national security is being
    assured. The perplexities and pressures have not abated.
    Recently decided cases, of which you all are cognizant, have served
    to highlight this outstanding problem of our time. I am confi­
    dent that our efforts in the past have been constructive, and I pray
..- that, despite unreasoning clamor and momentary passions, those
-- responsible for the administration of justice will continue to meet
    with calmness and courage the burdens they must bear.
       The present time is one of stress. It is not the first period of
    tension through which this Nation has passed, nor can we hope on
    any reasonable basis that it will be the last. Yet, it has been
    observed in our history that in such times there is a tendency for
    attacks to be mounted against the law itself and against the pro­
    cedure and personnel of the courts that administer it.
       I referred last year to a legislative proposal, apparently evoked
    by displeasure with a court of appeals decision directing release
    on bail of a well-known individual pending appeal of a conviction
    for perjury, that a cOlmnittee of Congress undertake an investi­
    gation of the competence, fitness, and legal qualifications of the
    entire Federal judiciary, I opposed this resolution, on the ground,
    among others, that it would be construed as an attempt to intimi­
    date the judiciary and would represent a lack of confidence in
    our system of government. I was happy to report to you then
    that the Senate Judiciary Committee had withdrawn the resolu­
    tion. But other proposals of similar character have arisen. Last
    January, in response to a request by the chairman of the Senate
                                    (37)
                                 38 


Judiciary Committee, I set forth my views concerning a proposed
resolution that a subcommittee of that committee make "a thor­
ough investigation of the Federal judiciary, and of actual or
attempted coercion or improper influencing of Federal judges and
the actual or potential sources thereof." I declared that I had no
knowledge of the need for such an investigation, and that if there
were complaints of improper conduct against any judge the con­
stitutional provisions on impeachment furnished an ample remedy.
I warned that an investigation of the kind proposed would be
attended by the sort of publicity and notoriety that could only
seriously prejudice the proper administration of justice. In April
of this year, there was introduced Senate Resolution 123, which
proposed the making of a study and investigation by the Senate
Committee on the JUdiciary with respect to the practices, proce­
dures, and legislative provisions involved in appointments to the
Federal judiciary, with particular reference to the political affilia­
tions of appointees, the proper interpretation of the advice and
consent clause of the Constitution, delays in filling vacancies, and
the utilization of minimum qualifications standards for appointees.
No action has been taken on this resolution.
   A troublesome problem in the balancing of individual rights
against the demands of national security has arisen by reason of
the recent defections of some of the persons admitted to bail in
certain national security cases. A suggestion has been made for
alteration of the Federal bail statute in H. R. 4821, which would
provide that bail shall not be taken from a surety listed as sub­
versive by the Attorney General of the United States. The Con­
ference may wish to set forth its views as to whether a statutory
adjustment is needed or not at this time. However it does seem
to me that, on the question of who may qualify as bondsmen, there
is sufficient authority now in the courts to exclude unreliable or
irresponsible sureties. And may I add that my Department has
not been remiss in calling this fact to the attention of the courts
when the occasion demanded it.
   In the interest of facilitating Federal criminal law enforcement,
the Department of Justice has sought legislation which would em­
power the Attorney General to obtain needed testimony by a grant
of immunity from prosecution to witnesses who claim their con­
stitutional privilege against self-incrimination in refusing to test­
ify before courts and grand juries and before congressional com­
                                 39 

mittees. In the light of the history of the constitutional privilege,
it is clear that the granting of immunity from prosecution would
present a means of obtaining needed testimony from those who
might otherwise hide behind the constitutional protection against
self-incrimination. If any witness, benefited by immunity, re­
fused to testify, he could then be punished for contempt; or, if he
committed perjury in his testimony, he could be convicted and
punished for that offense. In providing power to grant immunity
it has been our view that the authority should be centered in the
Attorney General because he is the official charged with the respon­
sibility for all prosecutions under the Federal laws. Similarly, in
extending the principle of immunity in exchange for testimony be­
fore a congressional committee we feel that responsibility must be
centered in the Attorney General or, at the very least, in a con­
gressional officer acting with the concurrence of the Attorney Gen­
eraL If authority for the granting of immunity is scattered it is
easy to foresee the impeding or complete frustration of prosecu­
tions contemplated by the Department of Justice on any matter
touched upon even incidentally in a congressional investigation.
Indeed, we might even have a repetition of the situation that
existed in the period between 1857 and 1862, when, under an act
of Congress that granted immunity in exchange for testimony in
the form of a complete legislative pardon for any act to which a
witness should be required to testify, persons deliberately sought
invitations to testify before Congress on matters regarding which
they had good reason to fear successful criminal prosecution.
   Two pending bills on the subject of immunity are S. 1747, which
deals with the granting of immunity before any grand jury or court
of the United States when, in the judgment of the Attorney Gen­
eral, the testimony of a witness is necessary in the public interest;
and S. 1570, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on
August 27, 1951, which would provide that a witness may be com­
pelled to testify before either House of Congress or a committee
thereof when a specified number of members of the committee
shall have authorized the granting of immunity to the witness.
Obviously, ~ have opposed S. 1570, since it violates the principle
of centralizing the responsibility for the grant of immunity in the
officer of the United States who is responsible for the prosecution
of offenders. On the other hand, S. 1747 recognizes that principle,
and I have fully supported it; and while S. 1747 does not relate to
                                 40 

congressional investigations it could be easily amended to that
end if it is considered desirable to do so.
   A second matter in which the Department of Justice has made a
strong recommendation for legislation, in the interest of better
law enforcement, has to do with perjury in the course of grand jury
investigations and the trial of cases. We feel that the Federal
authorities should be equipped with the same facility in dealing
with perjury as is enjoyed by enforcement authorities in a num­
ber of the States. In New York, for instance, when a witness
makes willful contradictory statements under oath, a case of per­
jury can be made out by establishing proof of that fact without a
showing by the prosecution of which statement is true and which
is false. Under existing Federal law (18 U. S. C. 1621) a person
may not be convicted of perjury for making contradictory state­
ments under oath unless the indictment charges and the prosecu­
tion proves which of the statements is false. And, as you know,
under the rules of proof in perjury cases, in order to convict, the
falsity of the statement made under oath must be established by
the testimony of two independent witnesses or by one witness and
corroborating circumstances. (Weiler v. United States, 323 U. S.
606.) Companion measures, H. R. 2260 and S. 1625, have been
introduced, which would make punishable the giving under oath
or affirmation, within a period of three years, of willful contradic­
tory statements on a material matter, either in proceedings before
a grand jury or during the trial of a case; and such perjury may be
established by proof of the willful giving or making of such con­
tradictory statements without alleging or proving which one is
false. Unfortunately, H. R. 2260 has been tabled by the House
Judiciary Committee after an adverse report by a subcommittee.
The Senate companion is pending before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   The reprehensible conduct of certain attorneys in the course of
recent trials involving the national security has given rise to pro­
 posals that the Supreme Court promulgate a code of ethics for
 members of the bar appearing before the Federal courts. H. R.
 1610 would empower the Supreme Court to do this. At the pres­
 ent time, of course, judicial supervision of the conduct of attor­
 neys in the Federal courts is not governed by court rules uniform
 throughout the United States and its Territories. Another pro­
 posal dealing with attorneys is Senate Resolution 92, which would
 place the Senate on record as favoring the disqualification from
                                       41

       practice before the Federal courts of attorneys who are known
       or proven to be members of the Communist Party, and the denial
 ~. 	 of admission to practice in those courts to persons known or proven
       to be Communists. On this general subject I can only suggest, as
       I did a year ago, the possible interest of this body in exploring the
       appropriateness of such proposals, together with any others that
       might promote the orderly conduct of criminal and civil trials.
          I should like to turn now to matters relating more specifically
       to the judiciary itself.
          At its September 1950 and March 1951 meetings, this Confer­
       ence recommended the creation of a number of additional judge­
       ships. Bills carrying out these recommendations have been intro­
       duced. S. 1203 is an omnibus bill that would provide for most of
       the additional jUdgeships recommended by this Conference as well
       as others which the Conference has not recommended. Hearings
       have been held on this bill, and the measure was reported on last
       month [So Rept. 691].
          In addition to S. 1203, a number of other bills have been intro­
       duced on the same subject. H. R. 3736 would create two addi­
       tional circuit judgeships for the Ninth Circuit. H. R. 163 would
 --	 provide one additional judgeship in the Third Division of Alaska.
,....' H. R. 3673 would provide one additional judge for the District of
       Arizona. H. R. 1324 would create one judgeship to serve both the
       Northern and Southern Districts of Indiana. S. 922 and H. R.
       1645 would make permanent the existing temporary judgeship
       for the Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri. H. R. 3099
       would provide that the incumbent of the roving judgeship in the
       Eastern, Middle, and Western Districts of Pennsylvania should
       succeed to the first vacancy occurrring in the Middle District, and
       that thereafter the roving judgeship should be eliminated. S. 88
       would create an additional judgeship in the Middle District of
       Tennessee. No action has been taken by the Congress on any of
       these bills.
          In my report to the Conference last year, I referred to the pos­
       sibility of amending the statutes dealing with the retirement of
       judges for disability so as to provide for cases where judges failed
       to retire in spite of incapacity and inability to serve continuing
       over a long period of time. A bill now before the Congress, H. R.
       3960, would in my opinion help to ameliorate this situation. It
       would provide that, in any case where a circuit or district judge
.- was eligible to resign or retire for disability under the provisions
                                 ·12 


of sections 371 or 372 of Title 28 and the judge failed to resign or
retire, and the President found that that judge was unable to dis­
charge his official duties efficiently by reason of permanent dis­
ability and that the appointment of an additional judge was neces­
sary for the efficient dispatch of business, an additional judge
might be appointed. The Department of Justice has submitted a
favorable comment on this bill. A similar provision appears in
section 5 of S. 1203, the omnibus judgeship bill to which I re­
ferred earlier. A further suggestion is contained in H. R. 107
which would amend section 371 of Title 28 to provide that a judge,
who resigned after attaining the age of 70 years and after serving at
least 10 years, would receive the salary of the office rather than,
as is the case at present, the salary he was receiving when he re­
signed. Thus, he would benefit by any statutory pay increases,
as in the case of a judge who retains his office but retires from
active service. No action has been taken on either of these bills.
I should like, nevertheless, to urge upon the Conference a con­
sideration of these proposals, and any others that may be forth­
coming, as a solution for the difficulties created by the continuance
in office of judges who unfortunately have been incapacitated for
long periods of time.
   For some time the Department of Justice has urged the enact­
ment of legislation to provide annuities for the widows and depend­
ent children of deceased judges and justices. Four bills on this
subject have been introduced in the present Congress, S. 16, H. R.
89, H. R. 1386, and H. R. 1763. The Senate bill is identical to
S. 3108, Eighty-first Congress, without certain amendments pro­
posed by the Senate Judiciary in the last Congress to give greater
protection to surviving minor children under its provisions. This
department has taken the position that it would prefer the enact­
ment of S. 16 if that bill were amended to conform with the earlier
committee proposals for altering S. 3108. While no further action
has been taken on the House bills, S. 16 was reported out of com­
mittee a month ago.
   On the subject of Territorial judges, H. R. 1741 would amend sec­
tion 373 of Title 28 to permit certain of these judges upon leaving
the bench, after having served for 10 years and having attained 70
years of age, to continue to receive the salary received at the time
of relinquishment of office. At present, such judges are not en­
titled to that full salary unless they have served 16 years.

        The tenure of Territorial judges in Alaska and the Virgin Islands
"",' would be changed by two bills that have been introduced at the
     present sessions. H. R. 158 would provide that judges of the
     United States District Court for Alaska, who are now appointed
     for terms of 4 years under section 112 of Title 48, should hold
     office during good behavior. H. R. 2731 would increase the term
     of the Dist.rict Judge of the Virgin Islands from 4 years as it is at
     present [48 U. S. C. 1405yJ, to 8 years. This change would bring
     his term into conformity with those of the judges of Puerto Rico
     and the Canal Zone [28 U. S. C. 134, 1353]. In its comment on
     these bills, the Department of Justice suggested that the House
     Judiciary Committee might wish to examine the entire question
     of the tenure of Federal judges in all of our territories and insular
     possessions with the view of obtaining uniformity in this field. No
     further action has been taken on either of these bills.
         Another bill, H. R. 2393, would authorize the Chief Justice to
     assign temporarily any circuit judge to sit upon the Supreme
     Court in place of any justice of that Court who had disqualified
     himself or was otherwise unable to serve. I t seems to me that a
     serious constitutional question is involved in any proposal which
~ would empower participation, as a member of the Supreme Court,
.~ by a judge who had not been appointed and confirmed by the Sen­
     ate to serve on that Court. In addition, there may also be a prac­
     tical objection in placing on the Chief Justice the responsibility to
     select the specific circuit judge who would serve in a particular case.
     So far no action has been taken on this bill.
         Two proposals now pending in the Congress are, it seems to me,
     worthy of your consideration. H. R. 486 would prohibit any jus­
     tice of the United States from testifying as to the character or
     reputation of any person or as to any matter of opinion in any
     action in any court of the United States. H. R. 950 would provide
     no Federal judge or justice shall be compelled to appear in any ju­
     dicial proceeding as a character witness or where, in the opinion of
      the court trying the case, the testimony of the judge could be ob­
      tained from other sources. The provision would be applicable to
     any action in any court, whether State, or Federal, but would not
     limit the right of any judge or justice from appearing voluntarily.
     No action has been taken on either of these bills.
         For several years consideration has been given both in the Jus­

-     tice Department and in the Judicial Conference to the question of
                                  44

amending the Expediting Act (15 U. S. C. 28) in antitrust cases.
A recommendation made at last year's meeting of this Conference            C
was embodied in H. R. 3516, which would permit the chief judge
of a circuit, if he determined that assignment of three judges to a
case under that act would unduly prejudice the dispatch of other
judicial business in the circuit, to assign it to a single judge for ex­
peditious disposition. The Department of Justice has supported
this bill, as it supported a similar proposal in the Eighty-first Con­
gress. I regret to advise this body, however, that the House Ju­
diciary Committee has recommended unfavorable action on the
present bill.
   In the field of criminal procedure, I should like first to report on
the situation with regard to the provision of legal representation
for indigent defendants in the Federal courts, a subject to which
the Judicial Conference has devoted special study and attention.
At its 1950 meeting, the Conference urged the enactment of S.
2206, Eighty-first Congress, which the Department of Justice had
also strongly recommended. A similar bill, H. R. 3978, has been
introduced in the present Congress and another bill, S. 1561, which
differs from it in some respects, is now pending in the Senate Judi­
ciary Committee. The Department of Justice has advised that
committee that the Department would prefer the enactment of the
                                                                           e
House bill which provides for the establishment of the office of
public defender, rather than for the appointment of counsel in
specific cases. There is another bill, S. 1210, now pending in the
Senate Committee for the District of Columbia, which would pro­
vide for the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants in
criminal cases in the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia. However, the committees involved have taken no
action on any of these bills.
   In my report to this body in 1950, I advised the Conference that
the language of the transfer provisions of Rule 20, Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure, prevents its application in cases where the
accused is confined in a penal institution but was not actually
"arrested" in the district where the institution is located. As a
consequence, we have many outstanding detainers filed against
prisoners because of indictments in districts other than those where
they are confined. This gives rise to many unfortunate effects
which I shall not repeat here. But I would like to urge again the
simple amendment to Rule 20 which, as set forth in last year's
report, would make it clear that a defendant may consent to the
                                     45 

   disposition in the district where he is held of an indictment or in­
   formation pending elsewhere.
      Two recent enactments affecting the release and parole of
   prisoners are worthy of mention in this discussion of criminal law
   administration.
      Public Law 62, approved on June 29 of this year, which was
   recommended by the Department of Justice, amended section 4164
   of Title 19, United States Code, to provide that whenever a re­
   leased prisoner has less than 180 days of the maximum term im­
   posed upon him remaining to be served, his release shall be
   unconditional. I believe that this measure will result in a con­
   siderable saving of the time, effort and expense formerly involved
   in keeping such persons on parole.
      Certain inequities in the laws relating to parole were corrected
   by Public Law 98, which became effective on July 31, 1951. This
   statut.e amended section 4202 of Title 18 of the Code so as to per­
   mit prisoners serving sentences of more than 45 years to be eligible
   for parole after 15 years, in place of the full one-third of the sen­
   tence formerly required, and also to provide that all prisoners serv­
   ing terms of over 180 days may be eligible for parole. Before this
   enactment, prisoners serving life sentences, being eligible for parole
-- after serving 15 years, received preferential treatment over those
   sentenced to terms longer than 45 years, and prisoners serving
   terms of less than 1 year were not eligible for parole at all.
      With respect to the Federal jury system, S. 1684 would amend
   section 1864 of Title 28 of the Code to provide for a jury commis­
   sion for each United States district court. This bill is similar to
   H. R. 2050, Eighty-first Congress, which this Conference and the
   Department of Justice approved. Other similar bills now pend­
   ing before the House Judiciary Committee are H. R. 3961, H. R.
   4514, and H. R. 293.
      In the matter of amending section 1861 of Title 28, United
   States Code, to remove from the states any control over the quali­
   fications of Federal jurors, thereby establishing uniform qualifica­
   tions for jurors in Federal courts, there are now pending S. 19 and
   H. R. 3959. This change has been approved by the Conference.
   H. R. 1983, which likewise is pending, would require that an oath
   of allegiance be taken by all Federal jurors. No action has been
   taken on any of these bills.
      Turning to matters of a civil nature, I should like first to refer
   again to a recommendation which I discussed at length in my
                                 46 

report to this Conference in 1950. In brief, it was the considered
view of my Department, as the chief litigant in admiralty cases,        ~
that now is the time for action by the Supreme Court to make
available to the district courts in their admiralty practice the
modern procedural advantages of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro­
cedure. I offered a fairly simple solution, in the form of a single
additional admiralty rule which would make the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure the supplemental source of decision in admiralty
matters. This would avoid the need at this time for general re­
vision of the Admiralty Rules, and would in fact provide a sounder
basis for their ultimate revision in the future. It is my hope that
this proposal will be speedily adopted. I again offer for the assist­
ance of the Conference the services of the admiralty specialists of
the Department of Justice.
   On August 1 of this year there went into effect Rule 71A of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This provides for a uniform
system of procedure governing all cases involving condemnation
of land in the Federal courts except those which fall under special
statutes. Prior to the adoption of this rule, Federal court proce­
dure was governed in ea<!h case by the procedures existing in the
respective States. The Department of Justice is now in the process      A
of working out the necessary adjustments to procedures under the        .....
new provision.
   As promulgated, subsection (h) of Rule 71A abolished the right
of trial by jury on the issue of just compensation, which had been
preserved in most of the Federal courts by virtue of the fact that
f1uch a right was granted by law in the great majority of the States.
Under the rule as it now stands, however, discretion rests with the
trial judge as to whether a jury or commissioners should be used.
A bill, S. 1958, has been passed by the Senate to restore the right
to trial by jury upon the demand of either party, and this bill is
now pending before the House Judiciary Committee. The De­
partment of Justice has consistently advocated permitting trial by
jury upon the demand of either party.
   At its 1950 meeting the Judicial Conference recommended the
prompt enactment of two bills then pending before the Congress
relating to the appellate review of certain orders of certain admin­
istrative agencies. One of these bills, providing for the review in
the courts of appeals of certain orders of the Federal Communica­
tions Commission, the United States Maritime Commission and of          ....
the Secretary of Agriculture, became law, Public Law 901, on            '-.,
December 29, 1950.
                                 47 


   The other bill, providing for review in the courts of appeals
of certain orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
failed of enactment, and a similar bill, H. R. 4025, has been
introduced in the present Congress. As introduced, section 10 of
this bill requires that a petition for certiorari must be filed within
60 days after the entry of final judgment and within 30 days after
an order granting or denying an interlocutory injunction. It is the
view of the Department of Justice that in the light of the general
gO-day period allowed for submission of a petition for certiorari
under section 2101 of Title 28, as well as the difficult and time­
eonsuming nature of such applications, the bill should allow 90
days for such petitions after final judgment and 45 days after the
entry of interlocutory orders. This was done in the case of P. L.
901 of the last Congress, and the same practice ought to be adopted
for orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
   Two proposals have been made to limit the removal of civil
actions from State to Federal courts. H. R. 1328 and H. R. 1988
would raise from $3,000 to $10,000 and $15,000, respectively, the
jurisdictional amount required for removal of actions from State
to Federal courts on the basis of a Federal question or diversity of
citizenship. There would be no change in the present jurisdic­
tional requirement of $3,000 in cases orginally brought in the
United States district courts on these grounds. In its comment
on these bills the Department of Justice has opposed their enact­
ment as creating an anomalous situation wherein a different
amount would be required for the removal of cases from State to
Federal courts than would be required for the original bringing of
suits on the same grounds in the Federal courts. In addition,
these changes might impair the usefulness of 28 U. S. C. 2403,
 whereby in cases in the Federal courts to which the United States
is not a party, the Attorney General may nevertheless intervene
on constitutional issues. No action has been taken by the Con­
 gress on any of these bills.
   Another bill, S. 1593, would raise from $3,000 to $5,000 the jur­
 isdictional amount for the Federal courts in cases based on diversity
 of citizenship. It is probable that the enactment of such a pro­
 vision would have only slight effect on the work of the courts or
 of the Department of Justice. This bill too is awaiting congres­
sional action.
    In my report last year I repeated a recommendation, which had
 been made in previous reports to this Conference, that there be
                                       48 

adopted uniform rules for all the courts of appeals, particularly ....
with reference to the preparation and contents of printed records 'w,;.
and briefs on appeaL I stressed last year that in my opinion the
importance of effecting that uniformity was increasing, and I wish
once more to suggest the desirability of taking that step.
   Similarly, it would be desirable to reconcile the existing differ­
ences of practice in the district courts with respect to the taxation
of costs in both civil and criminal cases. To provide a measure of
uniformity in that field would eliminate many disputes and at­
tendant delays. In addition, I mentioned last year the practice
which seems to have become the rule in many districts not to tax
the marshal's fees against criminal defendants. In some districts,
no costs of any kind are taxed against criminal defendants in
favor of the Government. Under section 1920 of Title 28, tax­
ation of costs lies within the discretion of the judge, but a uniform
practice against it in any court does not seem to be warranted, and
undoubtedly results in some unnecessary financial loss to the Gov­
ernment. Therefore, I should like once again to recommend that
the Conference call this situation to the attention of the district
judges.
   This meeting opens the thirtieth year of the Judicial Conference,                       C

established by the Congress in the act of September 14, 1922. It
is interesting to note that the official record of the first two meetings
of the Conference was first printed in the Texas Law Review of
June 1924 with the following note:
  This official memorandum of the first two meetings of the Federal Judicial
Council contains so much information of interest to lawyers and serves so well
to illustrate how an important piece of judicial machinery may be set up and
put to work and the sort of problems it has to deal with, that it is, with the kind
permission of Chief Justice Taft, reproduced in its entirety. ... ... ...
  If this evaluation of almost 30 years ago was meant to be a pre­
diction, it certainly has been made good by the splendid achieve­
ments of the intervening years. I am proud to have been able to
pa.rticipate in this work, and to have been able to present to this
group some of the annual summaries of things done and to be done,
which are the product of the work and thought of the hundreds
of able lawyers in the Department of Justice. I confidently ex­
pect that 30 years hence some other Attorney General will
stand before you to comment upon what may prove to be the even
greater achievements of the next three decades of the Judicial Con­
ference of the United States.
