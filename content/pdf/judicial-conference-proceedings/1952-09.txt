               REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

report appears in the appendix.
              STATEMENT OF CONGRESSMAN CELLER

  Representative Celler discussed informally with members of the
Conference various matters of legislation pertaining to the courts.
REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE
                      UNITED STATES COURTS

   Pursuant to the statute (28 U. S. C. 604 (a) (3)) the Director
had previously submitted his thirteenth annual report on the activ­
ities of his office for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1952, including
a report of the Chief of the Division of Procedural Studies and
Statistics on the state of the business of the courts. The Confer­
ence approved the immediate release of the report for publication
and authorized the Director to revise and supplement it in the final
printed edition to be issued later.
                     BUSINESS OF THE COURTS

   State of the dockets of the Federal courts-Courts of appeals.­
Cases commenced in the United States courts of appeals in the
fiscal year 1952 were 3,079, a slight increase as compa.red with
2,982 filed in the fiscal year 1951. Terminations were practically
equal to cases begun. At the end of the year there were 1,662
pending cases in which judgment had not yet been rendered. The
Fifth Circuit with 452 cases filed had the largest number of new
appeals but the Ninth Circuit with 444, and the District of Colum­
bia Circuit with 434, were close behind. The median time from
filing of the complete record to final disposition of cases terminated
after hearing or submission was 7.3 months for all circuits com­
pared with 6.7 months in 1951. In general the courts of appeals
are in good condition but the increase in business in the Fifth and
Ninth Circuits has resulted in lengthening the median time for
disposition in those circuits which is now 9.6 months for the Fifth
Circuit and 10.2 months for the Ninth Circuit. The Conference
has again recommended the creation of additional judgeships in
these circuits.
   Petitions to the Supreme Court for review on certiorari to the
United States courts of appeals were 592 as compared with 600
last year. The number of petitions granted, 90, was 14 more than
last year and the percentage granted was 15 percent in comparison
with 13 percent in the fiscal year 1951.
   District courtB.-A 13 percent increase in the civil business of
the district courts in the fiscal year 1952 as compared with 1951
has put a decided strain on the trial court machinery. Although
over a thousand more civil cases were terminated than in 1951,
yet the terminations in 1952 were 5,000 cases less than the number
filed, with the result that the number of civil actions pending
at the end of the year exceeded 60,000, which was twice as many
as were pending at the end of 1941, the last year before W orId
War II. The congestion is greatest in metropolitan districts but
the need for additional judgepower is also evident in a number
of other places where increases in population and industrial de­
velopments have resulted in a substantial increase in judicial
business.
   The rise in the number of civil cases this year was about equally
divided between United States civil and private civil cases, and
since the private civil cases on the average take much more judicial
time, they have been included separately in the following table
giving the figures for the past 12 years:

increased by 52 percent, while the number of district judgeships
has risen from 197 to 224, a rise of 14 percent. The number of
private cases begun annually has increased by 62 percent. The
numbers of all civil cases filed in the years 1945 to 1947 are much
larger than in previous years because of the large volume of price
and rationing cases brought by the government during that period.
   The median time from filing to disposition of civil cases ter­
minated after trial in the district courts having only federal juris­
diction went down slightly from 12.2 months in 1951 to 12.1 months
in 1952, while the median time from issue to trial decreased from
7.3 months to an even 7 months. However, the increase in some
metropolitan areas, including that of the Southern District of
New York where half the civil cases terminated after trial in 1952
required over 41 months from filing to disposition, indicates that
the delays in the trial courts of certain of our large cities amount
in some cases to a denial of justice. The Conference recommenda­
tions for additional judgeships are essential to remedy these
conditions.
   The number of criminal cases filed in 1952 was 37,950, a decrease
of about 700 from the previous year. The number of cases termi­
nated was a little over 1,000 less than the number filed and the
pending caseload rose to 8,754, of which over 1,700 involved fugi­
tive defendants and could therefore not be tried. The decrease
in the number of cases begun resulted from an even larger decrease
in immigration cases which constituted more than one-third of
all criminal cases filed. Without these cases, arising almost en·
tirely in the five districts on the Mexican border, there was some
increase in criminal cases over the previous year. In general the
criminal dockets are in excellent condition as a result of the rules
giving these cases priority.
   Bankruptcy cases which increased steadily in number from 1946
 to 1951, showed a small decline in 1952. The number of cases filed
was 34,873. Nearly 40,000 cases were terminated with the result
that the number of pending cases was reduced by almost 5,000.
    Cases and motions under advisement.-Further progress has
 been made during the past year in reducing the number of cases
and motions under advisement more than 60 days. As of June 30,
 1952, the number of such cases reported by the district judges
 was 88 compared with 121 reported the year previous. The num­
                                          5


ber of motions was 30 as compared with 41 at the end of the fiscal
year 1951. The number of cases and motions held more than 6
months, which are included in the figure already given, was 21
at the end of the fiscal year 1952 as compared with 27 at the end
of the previous year. Eleven of the cases and motions reported
as held over 6 months as of June 30, 1952, had been disposed of
before the meeting of the Conference. The Judicial Conference
expressed the hope that the judicial councils of the respective cir­
cuits will continue, in accordance with the direction of the Con­
ference last year, to give special attention to the reports of the
Administrative Office concerning cases and motions held over 6
months, with a view to expediting their disposition.

                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS NEEDED

  Recommendations for additional judgeships.-The Conference
reviewed the condition of the dockets of the district courts and the
courts of appeals. Conditions within each circuit were discussed
by the chief judge of that circuit and statistical data with reference
to the business of the courts were submitted by the Director.

                 SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS

   Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., chairman of the Committee on Sup­
porting Personnel of the Courts, informed the Conference that in
accordance with the previous instructions of the Conference (Jud.
Conf. Rept., March 1952, p. 21) the Administrative Office was en­
gaged in a study of the work of the clerks' offices of the United
States courts and the classifications of positions in those offices,
but that its study had not been completed and that it was not in a
position to make its report. Judge Biggs also stated that in accord­
ance with a direction of the Conference (p. 19 id.), his committee
was considering the sufficiency of the numbers of personnel and the
adequacy and fairness of existing classifications of officers and em­
ployees in the :Federal probation offices but that it was not ready
to make a report at this time. Consequently the report of the
Committee on Supporting Personnel in reference to the matters
of personnel of both the clerks of courts and the probation offices
was deferred. The Conference was gratified to note that a measure
which it had recommended a number of times beginning in 1948
(pp. 21-22 of the September 1948 report of the Conference), to
give secretaries and law clerks of justices and judges separated from
their employment without prejudice after 4 years or more of service,
a civil-service status upon passing a noncompetitive examination
similar to that given to employees of the Congress, had been en­
acted as Public Law 407 of the Eighty-second Congress approved
June 24, 1952.
   The Conference renewed its previous recommendation that leg­
islative authority be provided for the Director of the AdmiDlstra­
  • This action supersedes the previous recommendation of tll<' Conference first made in
September 1949 (Report, p. 6), and reaffirmed in September 1950 (Report. p. 5), and in
September 1951 (Report, p. 6), for a single additional jndge to serve in both the Northel'n
and Southprn Districts of Indiana.

tive Office to pay the necessary office and clerical expenses of United
States commissioners who devote their full time to the duties of
their office and do not engage in the private practice of law (pp.
22-23 of the March 1952 Report of the Judicial Conference).
                  BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

   Chief Judge Orie L. Phillips, chairman of the Committee on
Bankruptcy Administration, reported that the committee had met
and considered the recommendations contained in the report of
the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office concerning
certain changes in the salaries of referees, and other arrangements.
The report was made in the light of the amendment of section 40a
of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U. S. C., 68a) by Public Law 457 of the
Eighty-second Congress approved July 7,1952, which increased the
maximum annual salaries that may be fixed by the Conference to
$12,500 for full-time referees and to $6,000 for part-time referees.
The report was based upon a resurvey covering each referee posi­
tion in the system.
   The resurvey extended previous surveys through June 30, 1952,
and took into account both for the district and for each referee's
office, the number, size and character of pending cases; the number,.
size and character of new cases referred to the referees since July 1,
1947, and the payments by each district and by each referee into
the referees' salary and expense funds so far as available.
   The report of the Administrative Office was circulated among
the members of the Judicial Conference, the judicial councils, and
the district judges in accordance with the statute. Chief Judge
Phillips reported that the Committee on Bankruptcy Administra­
tion had considered the report of the Administrative Office, and all
recommendations received from the judicial councils, and the dis­
trict judges in regard to it. The committee agreed upon recom­
mendations which were contained in a written report submitted to
the Conference. Except in a few instances the report of the com­
mittee approved the report of the Administrative Office. The Con­
ference, after discussion, approved the report of the committee, and
in accordance with the report fixed the salaries of the referees at
the amounts shown in the following table. It directed that the
increases in salary shown in the table (except where otherwise
noted) should take effect October 1, 1952, subject to the obtaining
of the necessary funds in the appropriation.

                           CHANGES IN ARRANGEMENTS

  The following changes in arrangements for referees were rec­
ommended by the committee and approved by the Conference:

                                       EIGHTH CIRCUIT

  District of Minnesota,-That St. Cloud be added as a place of
holding court for the referee at St. Paul.

                                       NINTH CIRCUIT

   District of M0ntana.-That Lincoln and Flathead Counties be
transferred from the territory served by the referee at Butte to
the territory served by the referee at Great Falls.
   District of Nevada.-That Ely and Elko be added as places of
holding court for the referee at Reno.

                                    LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

  Amendment to section 66b of the Bankruptcy Act.-The chair­
man of the committee brought to the attention of the Conference
a recommendation adopted by the Judicial Conference of the
Seventh Circuit that section 66b of the Bankruptcy Act (unclaimed
moneys) be amended by adding a second proviso at the end of
the section. As amended the section would read as follows [italics
indicate the amendment]:
  b, DhWends remaining unclaimed for one year shall, uuder tile direction of
the court. be uistributed to the creditcrs whose claims have been alloweu but
not paid in full. aud after such claims ilave been paid in full the balauce 8hall
be paid to tile bankrupt: Provided, 'rlmt, in case unclaimed ui\'idemls belong
to minors, SUdl minors lllay ilave one year after aniYing at majority to claim
such di"idends: Providcd further, That if the Gourt .~Iwll tind that by re(lson
of t,'Ie smallness of the amount8 invol-ved or by reason at the larue 1I111nbm'
at creditors ill'l:oZ-v('d. or tor other {Joo(l find 811jJioiellt l'eason, that it is impracti­
ca/JIe to dist1'ilJute tile sum 80 paid into Gourt to tile crerlito/'x, tlien the CO/crt
                                        12 

ma,y, in its discretion, order the 8ame paid to the Treasurer of the United State8.
there to remain 8ubject to withdrawal by the rightful owner.~, only in con­
formity with the provi8ion8 of Seotion 2042 of Title :2~, U. S. C. A.

  It was the consensus of the committee, that in view of the exist­
ing provision of the section in relation to minors, a somewhat
different amendment would be advisable. The committee sug­
gested that Circuit Judge F. Ryan Duffy, District Judge Charles
G. Briggle and Mr. Edwin L. Covey, serve as a committee to make
a study of the matter and draft an amendment. The Conference
concurred in this suggestion.
  Amendment to section 35 of the Bankruptcy Act.-The chair­
man reported that the referee for the District of Columbia had re­
quested that section 35 of the Bankruptcy Act which now provides
that a referee shall reside and have his office within the judicial
district for which he is appointed, be amended so that the referee
serving the District of Columbia may reside outside the District.
A similar provison is now in effect with regard to district judges
and other officers serving the District of Columbia. The commit­
tee favored the proposed amendment and the Conference
recommended it.
      REPORT OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

   Under date of April 10, 1952, the Securities and Exchange Com­
mission sent to the chief judges of the circuits and to the chief
judge of each district court a report relating to the use of lists
of security holders in corporate reorganization cases. The report
suggested that consideration be given to the adoption of court
rules on the subject.
   Judge Phillips stated to the Conference that the Bankruptcy
Committee had considered the Commission's report and recom­
mended that the Conference suggest to the chief judges of each
circuit that a committee of district judges be appointed to study
the problem and report to the judicial conference of the circuit
concerned. The matter was left in the hands of the chief judge
of each circuit.

   VACANCIES TO OCCUR IN OFFICES OF REFEREES IN JUNE 1953

  The chairman of the committee informed the Conference that
vacancies will occur in approximately 42 referee positions on June
30, 1953, by expiration of the original 6-year terms, and suggested
                                 13 

that appropriate action be taken by the Conference with regard
to the filling of such vacancies at a special meeting of the Con­
ference to be held in the spring of 1953.
                THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM

   The Director presented a report pursuant to the direction of
the Conference at its meeting in March 1952 (p. 27 of the March
1952 report) concerning requests for increases in salaries of court
reporters which had been submitted to him. The report consisted
of a review of the earnings of the court reporters in general in
the fiscal year 1952 compared with prior years, and a specific re­
port and recommendation concerning each request for an increase
in salary which had been received.
   The report showed that during the period since July 1, 1945,
that the court reporting system has been in operation, there has
been generally from year to Yf'ar an increase in the net earnings
of the reporters, and that the upward trend although not large in
anyone year has been rather steady. A comparison of the earn­
ings in 1952 with those for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947,
shows a substantial advance.
   The Director reported on a request for a general increase in the
Ealaries of the reporters, and on eight requests for increases in the
salaries of specific reporters. The Director recommended against
:my general increase in the salaries of court reporters at this time.
The report pointed out that the Conference concluded at its annual
meeting in September 1951 that the increases in salaries which it
granted then in conjunction with the net earnings of the reporters
from official transcript. would give them reasonable compensation.
The increase in the cost of living from J~ly of 1951 to July of
1952. the latest date available, according to the price index of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. was
!Somewhat less than 3 percent. In accordance with the direction
of the Conference in September 1951, if there should be any fur­
ther legislation for inrrease in the compensation of Government
employees, effort would be made to include in it the reporters (p.
16 of the September 1951 report of the Judicial Conference). The
Director stated in his report that the facts set forth above in
reference to the earnings of the court reporters in 1952, showed
that generally they are reasonably compensated even when allow­
ance is made for the exacting demands of their work, and that this
particularly appears to be true when the relation of their earnings
                                  14

to those of other officers of the courts with important and difficult
responsibilities, although differing in nature, is considered.
   The report then dealt in detail with each of the eight requests
for increases in the salaries of specific reporters. The conclusion
of the report was that in none of the eight cases were there differ­
ences in the conditions from those that had been considered hy the
Conference in September 1951, which were of sufficient significance
and probability of permanence to warrant a change at this time.
  The Conference approved the report and recommendations of
the Director.
                           ApPROPRIATIONS

   Budget esti'mates and supplemental appropriations.-The Di­
rector submitted to the Conference estimates for supplemental ap­
propriations for the fiscal year 1953 and for annual appropriations
for the fiscal year 1954 which under the statute (28 U. S. C. 605)
require the approval of the Conference. The estimates for sup­
plemental appropriations for 1953 were for added amounts which
it was estimated would be needed for fees of commissioners, fees
of jurors, travel expenses, and salaries of court reporters. The
Conference approved each of these estimates and the addition of
an estimate for the cost during the fiscal year 1953 of increases
in the salaries of referees authorized by the Conference at this
meeting.
   In connection with the annual appropriations for 1954 the Con­
ference considered a request of Chief Judge Laws of the District
Court for the District of Columbia for additional funds for in­
creases in personnel and reclassifications of positions and increases
1Il salaries, also additional office machines, in various offices of the
court. The Conference heard Judge Laws on the matter. It ap­
peared that heretofore out of current appropriations, added sums
aggregating $13,510 annually have been provided for some addi­
tional personnel and reclassifications of positions for the court con­
cerned, and that a further sum of $41,500 for those purposes in
accordance with the previous action of the Conference, and $11,600
for modern office equipment are provided for in the estimates sub­
mitted by the Director for the annual appropriations for 1954.
The Conference approved an addition to the 1954 estimates of
$10,000 for salary of an administrative assistant to the chief judge.
Other requests of Chief Judge Laws were referred to the Committee
on Supporting Personnel.
                                 15 

  The Conference considered and discussed the estimates for the
annual appropriations for 1954. It approved the estimates as sub­
mitted plus an addition for the cost of increases in the salaries of
referees and a provision as stated for the salary of an administrative
assistant to the chief judge of the District Court for the District of
Columbia, both as authorized by the Conference at this meeting.

       VENUE AND J'URISDIC'rION OF THE DISTRICT COlJ"RTS

   Chief Judge Parker, chairman of the committee appointed to
study the venue and jurisdiction of the district courts, reported
that H. R. 3098 of the Eighty-second Congress passed the House
of Representatives on May 19, 1952, but was not acted upon by the
Senate. This bill would amend sections 1331 and 1332 of Title
28, United States Code, so as to fix the jurisdictional amount in
Federal question and diversity of citizenship cases at $10,000. The
Conference approved H. R. 3098 in the form in which it passed
the House of Representatives.
   The Conference also reaffirmed its approval of proposed legisla­
tion which was introduced in the Eighty-second Congress on the
recommendation of the Conference as H. R. 7623. This bill would
amend section 1332 of Title 28, United States Code, so as to provide
that in cases based upon diversity of citizenship a corporation shall
be deemed to be a citizen both of the State of its creation and the
State in which it has its principal place of business.
   The Conference also reaffirmed its disapproval of H. R. 6157 of
the Eighty-second Congress to prohibit the transfer of antitrust
cases brought under section 12 of the Clayton Act (15 U. S. c.
22) except with the consent of the party who began the proceeding.
                       CONDEMNATION CASES

   The Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of S. 1958 of the
Eighty-second Congress which would in effect amend Rule 7lA
(h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure so as to make a jury
trial in condemnation proceedings in the United States district
courts mandatory upon the demand of any party.
                      DEFINITION OF A FELONY

   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of S. 2993 and H. R.
7058 of the Eighty-second Congress. These bills, which were
introduced on the recommendation of the Conference, would amend
                                16 


the statute relating to the definition of a felony so as to provide
"That when a person is convicted of any felony and the sentence
imposed by the court; does not provide for imprisonment for a term
exceeding 1 year, such person shall, for all purposes, after the
Judgment of conviction shall have become final and after the sen­
tence imposed upon him shall have expired, be deemed to have
been charged with and convicted of a misdemeanor, and such per­
son shall not suffer any disability or disqualification which would
otherwise result from a conviction of a felony."

                OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM

  District Judge Harry E. Watkins presented the report of the
Committee on the Operation of the Jury System, which is under
his chairmanship.
  Pursuant to instructions of the Conference (September Session,
1951, Report, pp. 21-22; March Session, 1952, Report, p. 12) Judge
Watkins reported that his committee had completed a careful study
of certain resolutions of the Association of Grand Jurors of the
City and County of San Francisco, California, dealing with the
investigatory power and authority of grand jurors, and legislation
on the subject introduced in the Eighty-second Congress (S. 2086
and identical bills in the House, H. R. 5699 and H. R. 5700).
   The proposed legislation would add to Title 18 of the United
States Code a new section, providing that a Federal grand jury may
inquire at its own instance as well as at the instance of the court
or an attorney for the Government, whether a crime cognizable
by the court has been committed. It was the view of the committee
that this provision would add nothing to the powers possessed by
the Federal grand juries under existing law as declared by judicial
decisions, and it pointed out that only recently the matter had re­
ceived careful judicial consideration in the Northern District of
California, both in an opinion of the court there (U. S. v. Smyth
et al.) 104 F. Supp. 283, D. C. Calif., 1952) and by carefully con­
sidered instructions to a grand jury given by one of the judges
there and expressing the views of several of them. The committee
concluded that under these circumstances there is no need for
statutory clarification of this point. Furthermore, the committee
objected to certain other provisions of the proposed legislation
relating to the mandatory appointment and compensation at the
request of the grand jury of special counsel and investigators to
                                  17 

assist them, and permitting the grand jury to continue indefinitely
an investigation once begun by it, and requiring the district judge
to include in his charge to the jury a statement of its rights under
the proposed bill.
   Judge Watkins reported also that the resolutions of the Grand
Jury Association of the City and' County of San Francisco which
recommended provisions along the same lines as those incorporated
in the proposed legislation, had been studied with care by his com­
mittee; that the desire to facilitate law enforcement which they
manifest is commendable but that the committee could not agree
with the specific recommendations, since they are subject to the
same objections that it finds to the legislation on the subject which
it had considered.
   The Conference approved the report and recommendations of
the committee.
   Judge Watkins also informed the Conference that his committee
had considered two bills of the Eighty-second Congress (H. R.
7186 and 7574) dealing with investigations of prospective jurors.
The first of these would require each grand and petit juror to take
an oath of allegiance and each grand juror to subscribe to an affi­
davit concerning his qualifications. The second is the same except
that it would in addition require all grand jurors to be fingerprinted,
and all applicants for jury service to be investigated by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The committee had concluded that these
provisions are not necessary in order to secure jurors of unquestion­
able loyalty; that they might offend many patriotic and qualified
citizens who would be suitable for jury service, and would impose
a large burden upon the law enforcement agencies, without com­
mensurate value to the courts and the public. It was their view
that the problem of securing patriotic and loyal persons to serve as
jurors in the Federal courts is one that must be handled locally by
the courts concerned, and that this problem is now receiving care­
ful and suitable consideration in all districts. Accordingly, the
committee concluded that neither of the proposed bills should be
enacted.
   The Conference approved the report and conclusions of the'
committee.
   The Conference renewed its strong opposition to legislation of
 the character of H. R. 287 of the Eighty-second Congress which
would require Federal judges to conform to State procedure in the
instruction of jurors. It renewed its opposition to H. R. 5254 and
                                18 


its endorsement of H. R. 4514 of the Eighty-second Congress, both
dealing with the composition, compensation, powers and duties of
jury commissions in the District courts.
   The Conference instructed the committee to consider the ade­
quacy of the allowances for jury service in Alaska, and report its
conclusions to the Conference.
    WAGES AND EFFECTS OF DECEASED OR DESERTING SEAMEN

   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of S. 3261 and H. R.
8054 of the Eighty-second Congress. These bills, which were in­
troduced on the recommendation of the Conference, are designed
to provide a better method of dealing with wages and effects of
deceased or deserting seamen than the procedure followed under
existing law.

    PROCEDURE IN ANTITRUST AND OTHER PROTRACTED CASES

  Judge Prettyman, chairman of the Committee on Procedure in
Antitrust and Other Protracted Cases, reported to the Conference
that the committee had received assurances from the Assistant
Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of a policy of
cooperation by the Department of Justice in implementing the
committee's recommendations. A number of other suggestions
with respect to procedural devices in this type of case have been
brought to the attention of the committee. The report of the
committee was received and the committee was continued.

                     RETIREMENT OF JUDGES

   Circuit Judge Duffy, chairman, submitted a report on behalf of
the Committee on Retirement of Judges. After consideration of
the report of the committee, the Conference approved, with an
amendment, a proposed bill recommended by the committee. As
approved by the Conference the proposed bill would permit any
justice or judge of the United States appointed to hold office
during good behavior voluntarily to retire from regular active
service after attaining the age of 65 years and after serving at
least 15 years continuously or otherwise. This would be an addi­
tion to the present statute which permits such retirement at the
age of 70 years after 10 years of service.
   The bill recommended would also contain the changes approved
by the Judicial Conference at its March meeting in 1952 (pp. 16-17
                                   19 


of the March 1952 report of the Conference) in regard to the power
of the President to appoint an additional judge when a disabled
judge does not retire. The amendments then approved would
extend the present provision so as to include all judges appointed
to hold office during good behavior including judges of the special
courts; would include judges eligible to retire on account of perma­
nent disability as well as those eligible on account of age and length
of service; and would make requisite to the appointment by the
President of an additional judge when a disabled judge does not
retire, a certificate of the judge's inability to perform the duties of
his office signed by a majority of the members of the judicial coun­
cil of the circuit in the case of a circuit or district judge and in other
cases by a specified judge.
   The committee also recommended that the statute in reference
to the right of retirement of territorial judges (28 U. S. C. 373)
be amended to provide that such a judge should be entitled to
resign at full salary after attaining the age of 70 years and serving
as a judge at least 10 years, or after attaining the age of 65 years
and serving at least 15 years, and that if such a judge fails of re­
appointment or is removed by the President upon the sole ground
of mental or physical disability and his judicial service aggregates
 16 years or more he shall upon attaining the age of 65 years receive
for life the salary which he was receiving upon the relinquishment
 of his office; that if such service aggregates less than 16 years but
 not less than 10 years he shall upon reaching the age of 65 years
receive for life the proportion of his salary which the aggregate
 number of his years of service bears to 16. The Conference rec­
 ommended that the statute be amended in accordance with the
 report of the committee.
   The Conference approved in principle legislation to provide that
 judges of the United States District Courts for Hawaii and Puerto
 Rico hereafter appointed should hold office during good behavior,
 and requested the committee to prepare and submit to the Con­
 ference for consideration a bill for that purpose.

THE QUESTION OF LEGISLATION To AUTHORIZE COMPENSATION FOR
                          EXPERT WITNESSES

  Chief Judge Magruder, chairman of the committee to consider
whether statutory authority should be given to Federal judges to
compensate experts called by the court in civil litigation to testify
                                     20 


with respect to economic, professional, or other technical matters,
reported that the committee had discussed the matter but had not
yet arrived at a consensus of opinion and was not prepared to re­
port. The Conference granted the request of the committee to
defer its report until a later meeting.

             SOUND RECORDING OF COURT PROCEEDINGS

  Chief Judge Laws, chairman of the Committee on Sound Re­
cording in the District Courts, reported on a test of sound record­
ing made in the District Court for the District of Columbia in
the last year. He said that the impression produced upon the
committee and personnel of the court who were present was favor­
able, but that experimentation for further improvements in equip­
ment and technique, was going on and that it was expected that
progress would be made within the coming year. The Confer­
ence authorized the committee to continue its study.

                          PRETRIAL PROCEDURE

   Chief Judge Phillips at the request of Circuit Judge Alfred P.
Murrah, presented the report of the Committee on Pretrial Pro­
cedure. The report stated that continuous progress was being
made in the extent to which pretrial conferences were being used
in the federal courts and that between one-third and one-half of
all districts now used it regularly in most civil cases. Members
of the committee and other Federal judges have participated in
a number of pretrial demonstrations in various parts of the country
and the committee report stated that in its opinion this was a
most effective way of convincing lawyers and judges of the value
of pretrial procedure. The committee has been giving assistance
to newly appointed Federal judges by furnishing them informa­
tion concerning various techniques of pretrial procedure. It has
also endeavored to stimulate the various circuit committees which
have been appointed to deal with pretrial procedure. The fol­
lowing recommendations were approved by the Conference:
  1. That any member of this Pretrial Committee, with the consent of the
Chief Judge of his circuit, or any other juuge designated by the Chief Judge
of his circuit is authOlizeu to visit any district comt in his circuit for the
purpose of consulting concer-ning the use of pretrial procedure in that court,
and in the event he is im'iteu to do so, to sit with the judge of said court to
advise and assist him in holding pretrial conferences. A judge may be author­
                                        21 

ized to go from one circuit to another for this purpose if he receives a designation
from the Chief Justice as in the case of an assignment for holding court.
   2. In order to revitalize the circuit committees on pretrial, the committee
recommends that the Conference request the Chief Judge of each circuit to
appoint a regular standing committee of his circuit conference on pretrial
procedure, consisting of at least five members, where SUell II committee does not
now exist. to include botb district judges and lawyers with at least one member
from each state in the circuit to serve for stated terms and until their suc­
cessors are appointed; such circuit committees to be charged witb the duty of:
   (a) Ascertaining tbe extent and efficiency of the employment of pretrial pro­
 cedure in the Federal and State courts in the circuit,
    (/) Considering appropriate measures to promote its wider understanding
 and use and taking appropriate action, and
    (c) l\laking an annual written report of its activities and of the extent of
 the employment of pretrial in the cil'cult to the annual conference of the
 circuit and furnishing a copy to the chairman of this committee.
The committee further reported that the Administrative Office
of the United States Courts will make a survey of the use of pre­
trial conferences in the Federal courts during the coming year.
   The Conference directed that the report of the committee be
received and approved and that copies be circulated among the
members of the Federal judiciary,

                             JUDICIAL STATISTICS

    Circuit Judge Charles E. Clark, chairman of the committee, pre­
 sented its report. He referred to the use of the Administrative
 Office statistics by the Senate and House Committees on the Judi­
 ciary in their reports on the omnibus judgeship bill and stressed
 the importance of the Conference recommendations and the pres­
 tige they had with the Congress. In connection with Conference
 recommendations for additional judgeships, the committee report
 suggests that normally such recommendations. should first be made
 by a circuit council or a circuit conference and that the Adminis­
 trative Office should be informed of the recommendations at least
 G weeks before the Judicial Conference meeting. This will enable
 the office to prepare and send out to each member of the Confer­
 ence a report of the business of each court affected, thereby giving
 them an opportunity to make a careful study of the proposals in
 advance of the meeting.
    Judge Clark referred to the research work which had been done
 by the Administrative Office in the field of discovery and of habeas
 corpus and stated that surveys on the costs of appeals and pretrial
 procedure were now in the planning stage. On the recommenda­
                                 22 


tion of the committee pretrial statistics will be published hereafter
in the quarterly and annual reports of the Director.
   The report of the committee was received and approved and
authority was given to bring it to the attention of circuit and
district judges.
           REVISION OF CRIMINAL AND JUDICIAL CODES

  For the Committee on Revision of the Criminal and Judicial
Codes, Judge Maris, chairman, reported that he had been requested
by the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of American
Samoa to investigate the existing judicial system in those islands
and to recommend legislation for its improvement; that after
an investigation and study, including a visit to Samoa, he had in
June of this year transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior his
recommendations.
  Judge Maris also reported that the proposals which he had made
for the revision of the judicial system of the Trust Territory of
the Pacific Islands last year were enacted into law by executive
order of the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory dated
February 14, 1952.
COMPENSATION OF COUNSEL ApPOINTED BY COURTS TO REPRESENT
             INDIGENT LITIGANTS IN CRIMINAL CASES

  The Conference renewed its approval of legislation to provide
for the payment of compensation and reimbursement of expenses
of counsel appointed by courts to represent defendants in criminal
cases. It specifically approved a bill pending in the Eighty-second
Conbrress (H. R. 3978) which permits compensated representation
to be furnished either by a public defender appointed by the court
or by the payment of fees within specified limitations to counsel
appointed by the court in' particular cases, with a proviso that
the adoption of the latter method by any district containing a
city of more than 500,000 population shall require the approval
of the judicial council of the circuit. The Conference was of thE'
opinion that the lack of any provision at the present time for
compensating or even reimbursing the expenses of counsel ap­
pointed by the court to defend poor persons accused of crime, was
a serious defect in the Federal judicial system. Accordingly it
directed that every effort be made to procure from the next Con­
gress remedial legislation of the nature contained in the pending
bill.
                                 23
               PROTECTION OF PROBATION OFFICERS

  The Conference approved a recommendation made by the Judi­
cial Conference of the Eighth Circuit that probation officers be
added to the list of certain officers and employees of the United
States protected by Section 1114 of Title 18, United States Code.
This section of the code makes the killing of certain named officers
and employees of the United States while engaged in the perform­
ance of their official duties or on account of the performance of
their official duties an offense against the United States.

ELIMINATION OF REQUIREMENT OF NOTICE OF HOLDING TERMS OF
                         COURT IN ALASKA

  The Conference approved a recommendation of the Judicial
Conference of the Ninth Circuit that Title 48, U. S. C. 102, be
amended so as to eliminate the requirement that at least 30 days'
notice shall be given by the judge or clerk of the time and place of
holding terms of court in Alaska.

PROPOSAL BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF AN
                  AMENDMENT OF CIVIL RULE        8
   Judge Denman presented a resolution adopted by the judicial
conference of the Ninth Circuit recommending that the part num­
bered 2 of Rule 8 (a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure which now
provides that the initial pleading in a civil case shall contain "a
short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader
is entitled to relief" shall be amended to require that it shall con­
tain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
pleader is entitled to relief, which statement shall contain the facts
constituting the cause of action." Upon motion the resolution
was referred to the Supreme Court Advisory Committee on Rules
for Civil Procedure.

RULES ADOPTED BY COURTS OF ApPEALS FOR REVIEW OR ENFORCE­
          MENT OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

   Section 11 of Public Law 901 of the Eighty-first Congress ap­
proved December 29, 1950 (5 U. S. C. Supp. V, 1041), provides
for the adoption, subject to the approval of the Judicial Confer­
ence, of rules governing the practice and procedure in proceedings
to review or enforce orders of certain administrative agencies. The
                                 24 


Conference approved rules adopted by the Courts of Appeals of
the District of Columbia, Third, Fourth, and Tenth Circuits, pur­
suant to this provision.
LEGISLATION TO ADD TO THE GROUNDS FOR A MOTION TO VACATE OR
           SET ASIDE A SENTENCE IN A CRIMINAL CASE

  An amendment of Section 2255 of Title 28 of the United States
Code provided for by H. R. 8147 of the Eighty-second Congress
which would add to the grounds for a motion to vacate or set aside
a sentence in a criminal case, that the person sentenced was not
the person that committed the crime, was disapproved. It was
the view of the Conference that Section 2255 in its present form
gave as broad a right of review as was advisable, that meritorious
cases not covered by the Section would be very rare, and that if
occasionally there was such a case, it would be better to leave the
remedy to executive clemency,

SALARIES OF THE UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS FOR GREAT SMOKY
                  MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK

   Prior to the enactment of Public Law 477 of the Eighty-second
Congress approved July 9, 1952, one salaried United States com­
missioner for Great Smoky Mountains National Park was ap­
pointed by joint action of the United States District Courts for the
Western District of North Carolina and the Eastern District of
Tennessee. That Act provided for the appointment of two sal­
aried commissioners, one to be appointed by the United States
District Court for the Western District of North Carolina to serve
that part of the park which is situated in North Carolina and the
other to be appointed by the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Tennessee to serve that part of the park which
is situated in Tennessee. Under section 634 of Title 28, United
States Code, each national park commissioner receives an annual
salary fixed by the district court which appoints the commissioner
with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States.
The Director of the Administrative Office reported that he had been
informed by the district court for each of the districts mentioned
that, subject to the approval of the Judicial Conference, it will fix
the salary of the commissioner for the part of the park in that dis­
trict at the sum of $1,900 per year. The sum of these salaries.
$3,800 per year, will be the same as the salary of the commissioner
                                       25 


who previously had jurisdiction over the entire park. The Con­
ference approved the salaries fixed by the district courts.
CERTAIN BILLS PENDING BEFORE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

   ~n response to a request from the chairman of the Committee
{)n the Judiciary of the House of Representatives for an expression
of the views of the Conference with regard to a number of bills of
the Eighty-second Congress referred to that committee, the Con­
ference took the following action:
  S. 2546 entitled "An act to provide for attorneys' liens in proceedings before
the courts or other departments and agencies of tlle United States"; approved
the bill.
  H. R. 6317 entitled "A bill to amend section 1923 (a) of title 28, United States
Code, relating to docl;:et fees"; referred the bill to the Committee on Revision
of the Criminal and Judicial Codes.
  H. R. 7187 entitled "A bill providing that the United States shall have a civil
action against any person who bribes or attempts to bribe an officer or employee
of the Government" ; referred the bill to the Committee on Revision of the Crimi­
Dal and Judicial Codes.
   H. R. 74£[; entitled "A hill to amenrl Section 3185 of Title 18, United States
 Code"; referred the bill to the Committee on Revision of the Criminal and
J"udicial Codes.

        QUARTERS OF THE COURTS AND RELATED FACILITIES

    In response to invitation Honorable W. E. Reynolds, Commis­
'Sioner of the Public Buildings Service, and Mr. Gilbert S. Under­
 wood, Director of the Design and Construction Division of that
Service, attended the meeting of the Conference and discussed
with the members problems concerning the quarters and related
 facilities of the courts. Particular consideration was given to the
 air conditioning of quarters of the courts in locations where extreme
 heat not only causes discomfort during the summer to persons
having business in the courts, jurors, parties, witnesses and lawyers,
as well as the judges and other officers of the courts, but necessarily
 reduces the efficiency and output of the courts during the hot
months of the year. The Conference emphasized that it is par­
ticularly important now in view of the stress of increasing business
 in virtually all of the Federal courts, that the courts should be able
 to operate effectively during the summer, and that to this end the
 air conditioning and cooling of the court quarters in many places
 is essential. Commissioner Reynolds indicated that although
funds are lacking for this purpose in the current appropriations to
 the Public Buildings Service, the utmost effort would be exerted
      224G44-tlS-S
                                 26 

to procure such funds for application      III   appropriate cases   III
future appropriations.
PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF STATUTES RELATING TO RECORD ON
              REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

   Mr. Joseph W. Stewart, Clerk of the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, presented to the Con­
ference suggestions that existing statutes be amended so as to per­
mit administrative agencies to send to the courts of appeals the
original records of cases in lieu of transcripts; to send abbreviated
records where the whole record is not necessary; and to permit
records to be returned at the conclusion of the case to the ad­
ministrative agencies from which they were received. The sug­
gestions were referred to the Committee on Revision of the
Criminal and Judicial Codes for consideration.

     REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT ON
                  ECONOMIES IN ADMINISTRATION

   A report of the Committee on Economies in Administration of
the Eighth Circuit of which District Judge Gunnar H. Nordbye
of Minnesota is chairman and which had been presented at the
recent judicial conference of the Eighth Circuit, was brought to
the attention of the Conference. The report showed economies
particularly in the elimination of branch offices of clerks of district
courts without sufficient business to justify their continuance and
in the cost of juries, which were being effected. These were along
lines recommended in 1948 by the Conference Committee on Ways
and Means of Economy in the Operation of the Federal C{)urts
 (pp. 33-38 of the September 1948 report of the Conference, par­
ticularly pp. 34-36). The Conference was gratified by the sus­
tained effort to avoid unnecessary expense in the conduct of the
Federal courts which the courts of the Eighth Circuit are making,
and by the savings which are being accomplished. The Confer­
 ence directed that the report be circulated among the circuit and
 district judges of the United States, and commended it for their
 careful consideration.
                             COMMITTEES

  The Conference renewed the authorization to the Chief Justice
to take whatever action he deemed desirable with respect to in­
                                 27 

(lreasing the membership of existing committees, the filling of com­
mittee vacancies, and the appointment of new committees. Sub­
ject to such action existing committees were continued. The Con­
ference continued the Advisory Committee consisting of the Chief
Justice and Chief Judges Stephens, Biggs, Parker, and Phillips, to
advise and assist the Director in the performance of his duties.
   The Conference declared a recess, subject to the call of the Chief
Justice.
   For the Judicial Conference of the United States:
                                          FRED M. VINSON,
                                                    Chief Justice.
   Dated Washington, D. C., October 22,1952.
                           APPENDIX

REPORT OF HONORABLE JAMES P.1YlcGRANERY, ATTORNEY GENERAL
                      OF THE UNITED STATES

Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference of the
        United States, Honored Guests:
     Before I begin my report on the administration of justice in the
United States, I wish to express my deep appreciation to the Chief
..Tustice for his courtesy in granting this time.. Well aware of your
heavy schedule, I shall endeavor to discuss a few matters for im­
 mediate consideration and I shall submit the fully developed De­
 partment comments in mimeographed form to be read at your
 leisure.
     It may not be amiss to ask that you take judicial notice of the
 limited length of time that I have had the honor and the privilege
 of service as the Attorney General. On May 27 I took my oath of
 office, which was graciously administered by our distinguished
 Chief Justice; hence my tenure thus far covers less than 4 months.
 During this period every division head (with one exception) has
 been changed and there have been correspondingly complete new
 revisions and reviews for the purpose of achieving more efficient
  administra tion.
     One of my first acts was to request reports from all division
  heads; and following this, I summoned all the United States at­
  torneys to a conference--and asked that they submit written re­
  ports on their respective offices with data compiled according to
  uniform specified points of examination. This survey is enabling
  us to ascertain if members of the Department in the field have been
  and are functioning in accordance with the high standards requisite
  for proper administration and to make corrections where indicated.
      In a spirit of thankfulness to our beloved President, it is my
  happy prerogative to announce to your conference that President
  Truman has made available from his fund to the Department of
  Justice the sum of $50,000 for the purpose of a departmental sur­
  vey and analysis of its operations and functioning by independent
  ('fficiency experts for the purpose of streamlining the administra­
                                 l :!8)
                                 29 

tion of departmental business. This is the first time that a com­
plete survey has been undertaken since the creation of the De­
partment; and during the interim the changing needs of these
changing years have brought about constant additions and a mul­
tiplicity of procedures with consequent and inevitable duplication.
Such a streamlining as we now envision will result not only in
financial saving to the taxpayers but also in more efficient prose­
cutive action, and swifter and more certain justice to those whose
problems are within the scope of the Department's jurisdiction.
   Reference should now be made to concurrent investigations of
the Department of Justice by congressional eommittees which were
in existence prior to the tenure of this Attorney General. It is
our announced policy and our active program to assist these com­
mittees and to cooperate with them in every way that will not
retard our own prosecutive actions, while maintaining the mutual
respect of a coequal branch of the Government. If the organiza­
tion or the work methods of the Department have been found
wanting in the discharge of the sacred duty of administering jus­
tice, we must be profoundly eager to learn the cause of such fail­
ure-wherever the cause may lie. Only then can we be sure that
we will be at all times alert and equipped to enforce Federal laws
impartially and expeditiously, amid the challenging problems of
today and tomorrow.
   Perhaps it is not amiss to refer to a few of numerous changes
recently inaugurated. Our Internal Security Section of the Crim­
inal Division is undergoing expansion in order that the thorough,
patient and vigilant investigations of the Federal Bureau of Inves­
tigation in the vital area of subversive activity may be followed
by prompt and effective prosecution by lawyers who have special­
ized in such cases, with proper protection of the civil rights guaran­
teed by the Constitution.
   Your attention may already have been directed to my recent
order discontinuing the so-called "racket grand juries." In my
opinion they achieved nothing that could not have been accom­
plished with dignity, order and completeness by the grand juries
provided for under existing law. Furthermore, the basis for call­
ing them could be construed as an unjustified reflection upon our
eminently adequate Federal system of justice which, comprising
as it does-the Federal judiciary, the Department of Justice, and
the regular grand juries-has proved effective in accordance with
the ideals of our founding fathers.
                                 30 


   The militant and reasoned motive of the reorganized department
has been the restoring of the confidence of the American people in
the administration of justice, and to this task, as one team, we have
devoted our full time and our full powers.
   In this undertaking we have had the inspiring aid and encourage­
ment of President Truman and the wholehearted cooperation of
the members of the Federal judiciary. Our gratitude should be
expressed even in token fashion at this time.
   It is the wish of the Department to be of service to the judiciary
wherever and whenever a desire for such service is requested.
   At the present time under my personal supervision, a thorough
study is in process concerning the difficult problems which arise
from the so-called "conflict of interest statutes." As soon as con­
crete and constructive suggestions have been formulated, they will
be embodied in a report to the President with a recommendation
for legislation.
   Your attention is respectfully directed to the proposal submitted
by the Department to the President recommending that a govern­
mental commission, augmented by an advisory committee, be es­
tablished to study existing international practices of judicial assist­
ance for the purpose of drafting such legislation and international
agreements as may be deemed appropriate. The President has
informally expressed approbation of this proposal. Nevertheless,
since the establishment of such a commission would require financ­
ing not presently available, it has been decided to defer its estab­
lishment until congressional authorization and appropriations can
be obtained. It is our hope and expectation that when the time
 for action arrives, the Federal judiciary may be of one mind with
 with the executive and legislative branches of the Government in
 this matter.
    The proposal is outlined more specifically in the memorandum
 of the Department which I have taken the liberty of submitting
 for your consideration. Also included in the memorandum are
 other departmental observations which I offer for your considera­
 tion but without any recommendation as to the conclusions which
 you will, in your wisdom, formulate during the course of your
 deliberations.
    Since taking my oath as Attorney General I have investigated
  and processed 17 nominations for judgeships which nominations
  went forward to the Senate; 7 of which the Senate confirmed before
                                  31 


adjournment; with 10 pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee
at the time of adjournment.
   Finally, I wish to say a word of gratitude to the ,Chief Justice and
to all the gentlemen of the conference for your graciousness today
and throughout the past months. The Department will endeavor
to work, with God's help, toward the fulfillment of our common
goal, the administration of justice.

         MEMORANDUM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

                          I. CIVIL MATTERS   ~



   Committee on Antitrust and Administrative Trial Procedure.­
The Department of Justice has followed with keen interest the
work of your Committee on Antitrust and Administrative Trial
Procedure. We have carefully studied that Committee's report on
procedure in antitrust suits and other protracted cases, which you
adopted last year, and our Antitrust Division has taken the initia­
tive in promoting the use of the procedures recommended in that
report. In addition, since its issuance, we have informed the Com­
mittee Chairman, Judge Prettyman, of our experience in applying
some of those procedures in actual cases, and are in a position to
state confidently that the implementation of the Committee's rec­
ommendations has had, and may be expected to continue to have,
a salutary effect in simplifying and shortening to a substantial
extent the trial of antitrust cases.
   Amendment of Expediting Act.-In the antitrust field, one prob­
lem which has been of especial concern for several years, to this
Conference and the Department of Justice, is that of amending
the Expediting Act, 15 U. S. C. 28, so as to preserve the right to
have antitrust cases of great public importance expeditiously tried
by a three-judge court and at the same time to assure the jUdiciary
that it will not be unduly hindered in the discharge of its heavy
r~esponsibilities by repeated calls upon three judges in a single case.
The awareness of the Department of Justice of the burden which
the appointment of a three-judge court imposes on the discharge
of other judicial business is shown by the fact that expediting cer­
tificates have been filed in only six cases in the last 15 years. In
cases such as those six, however, the establishment of a three-judge
court seems to the Department of Justice to be essential.
                                       32 

  By letter of June 20, 1952, to the Director of the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts, the Department suggested the
possibility that sO!lle relief might be afforded the judiciary, without
prejudicing this interest of the public, if following the rendition
of judgment by a three-judge court in any case, the Chief Judge
of the appropriate district court were authorized) on request of
the three, to designate a single judge to hear and rule on matters
involving the interpretation, enforcement, or amendment of that
judgment. This Conference may wish to consider the suggestion
contained in that letter, namely, that the judiciary sponsor legis­
lation adding to the Expediting Act language to the following
effect:
  After entry of a final judgment disposing of all issues in such caRe and after
the time to appeal from such judgment has expired, or appeal therefrom has
been dismissed, or the judgment has been affirmed on appeal, the chief judge
of the district court of the district in which the judgment was entered may,
on the written request of the three judges who entered the judgment, designate
a judge of the district court to heal' and determine all matters relating to
carrying out, interpretillg, enforcing, or amending the provisions of the judgment.
   Assignment of complex cases to single judge.-In the various
fields where cases of great complexity arise, or in those where
numerous motions may be anticipated, experience has shown that
it is of greatest advantage to litigants and the least burden to the
judiciary if the cases are assigned for all purposes to a single judge.
This procedure eliminates the necessity for different judges famil­
iarizing themselves with the whole of a complicated case each time
a new motion is presented; and in general results in a sounder
and more consistent disposition of interlocutory matters. The De­
partment of Justice recommends earnestly the extension of this
practice to all such cases to the maximum practicable extent.
   Uniform rules for courts of appeals.-In the Attorney General's
Report to this Conference last year) he repeated a recommendation
that had been made in previous 'reports to this body as to the
desirability of adopting uniform rules for all the courts of appeals,
particularly with reference to the preparation and contents of
printed records and briefs on appeal. The importance and ad­
visability of accomplishing such uniformity is steadily increasing,
and it is again recommended to this Conference that that step
be taken.
    Uniform rules for review of Tax Court decisions.-The promul­
gation of uniform rules would be particularly desirable with ref­
 erence to the review of decisions of the Tax Court of the United
                                 33 

:States by the various Courts of Appeals. The Government, of
course, is a party in all of these cases. There are approximately
400 such cases every year, and economies in both time and effort,
 not only for the Government but also for others who litigate in
 more than one circuit, would result from establishing uniform
 provisions to replace the present divergent rules. Accordingly,
 the Department of Justice has endorsed an American Bar Associa­
 tion proposal that Congress give authority to the Supreme Court
 to prescribe rules of procedure for review of decisions of the Tax
 Court of the United States.
     Time of delivery of ordinary transcript.-It will be recalled that
 28 U. S. C. 753, in addition to providing for the salaries of court
 reporters, permits each reporter to charge and collect fees for tran­
 scripts requested by the parties, including the United States, at
 rates prescribed by the court, subject to the approval of the Judi­
 cial Conference. For 'ordinary delivery of transcript the Confer­
 ence has fixed a maximum rate of 55 cents per page, and for daily
 delivery a maximum rate of 90 cents per page, nearly 64 percent
 ~higher than the ordinary delivery rate. Most of the courts have
 set these maximum rates as the rates to be charged.
     There appears to be no problem in the case of daily delivery.
  It is well understood that the transcript of the whole day's pro­
 'Ceedings will be furnished by a given hour of the following day,
  usually before the customary hour for convening of court. On
 the other hand, there is no definite understanding with respect to
 time in the case of ordinary delivery of transcript. Actual de­
  liveries vary in time from a few days to as high as 4 weeks. The
  resulting uncertainty, in relation to available time limits, practi­
  cany forces the purchase of daily deliveries at the much higher
  rates, as a precaution against damaging delay.
     This unnecessary burden and expense upon litigants who do
  not need daily transcripts of proceedings could be eliminated by
  the Conference fixing some outer time limit within which court
  reporters would be expected to provide ordinary delivery of tran­
  script. A maximum period of 10 days would not appear to be
  unreasonable.
     Integration of Admiralty Rules and Rules of Civil Procedure.­
 Two years ago, and again in 1951, the Attorney General in his
  Report to this Conference stressed the importance and urgency
  of the need to integrate the Admiralty Rules with the Federal
  Rules of Civil Procedure so as to cover many situations in which
                                 34

litigation needlessly arises because of ambiguities in the Admiralty
Rules. The need for that integration continues, and we again rec­
ommend that it be undertaken either by the adoption of a single
rule making the Civil Rules applicable to admiralty cases not
dealt with in the Rules of Admiralty, a method we prefer, or by
wholesale specific revisions in the Admiralty Rules.

                       II. CRIMINAL MATTERS

   Amendment of Rule 20.-At the 1950 and 1951 meetings of the
Judicial Conference, your attention was invited to the desirability
of amending the transfer provisions of Rule 20 of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure. The language of the rule, making its ef­
fect depend on an arrest and the place of arrest, prevents its appli­
cation in cases where the accused is confined in a penal institution,
but was not actually "arrested" in the district where the institution
is located. Thus, the provisions of the rule, which would other­
wise permit transfer to, and disposition of outstanding charges by,
the courts of the district of confinement, cannot be applied to a
prisoner confined but not arrested in that district until after he
has completed his sentence and is taken into custody again to an­
swer the indictment or information pending in the other district.
As a consequence we have many outstanding detainers filed against
prisoners because of indictments in districts other than where they
are confined. When a detainer has been filed against a prisoner
because of such an outstanding indictment or information, he is
barred from consideration for parole. He becomes. in the opinion
of the prison authorities, a greater custodial risk. And, if he in­
sists on his rights, he may eventually have to be removed to the
district where he was indicted at considerable expense to the Gov­
ernment.
   In May of this year, the Department of Justice invited the at­
tention of the Supreme Court to this problem, suggesting that
the Court might consider exercising its power to bring about a
change in the rule. The Supreme Court would undoubtedly wel­
('orne the views of this Conference on the subject.
   The recommendation for change which the Department favors
is identical with the proposal that was submitted by the Attorney
 General in 1950, with a slight variation that will assure the re­
tention of the Rule 20 privilege for persons who have been admit­
 ted to bail. It would retain all of the provisions of Rule 20 as they
                                       35 

now are, and would simply add in the first sentence after the word
"arrested," the words "or held," and after the words "was arrested,"
the words "or is held." No other changes would be necessary in
the rule. So amended, the first sentence of Rule 20 would read:
  A defendant arrested or held in a district other than that in which the indict­
ment or information is pending against him 'may sta te in writing, after receiv­
ing a copy of the indictment or information, that he wishes to plead guilty
or nolo contendere, to waive trial in the district in which the indictment or in­
formation is pending and to consent to disposition of the case in the district in
which he was arrested or is held, subject to the approval of the United States at­
torney for each district. [Language. to be inserted is italicized.1
   Reduction of sentence under Rule 35 after expiration of time.­
In United States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469 (1951), the attempted
grant of a new trial by a district court on its own initiative under
Rule 33, after the time limitations fixed by that rule had expired,
was held to be improper and at variance with the purpose of the
rule, The attention of this body is invited to another practice
"which seems in like degree contrary to the purpose of another rule,
Rule 35, which deals with the authority of a court to reduce sen­
tences within a specified time after their imposition. In some few
instances, sentences partly served have been reduced after the time
period specified in Rule 35 has elapsed. Presumably, the actions of
the judges in those cases were motivated by considerations of jus­
tice or mitigating circumstances of which they may not have been
aware at the time of sentencing, but the practice seems to be clearly
in contravention of Rule 35. The Conference may wish to take
note of such action and to discourage it particularly because under
existing law (18 U. S. C. 3731), there is no opportunity for the
Government to appeal from such court action.
   Counsel for indigent defendants.-The problem of providing
adequate counsel for indigent defendants, either by means of a
public defender or by compensated court-appointed attorneys, has
been a matter of serious concern to, and agreement between, the
Conference and the Department of Justice. Both approved in
1950 a bill to that end, S. 2206, then pending in the Eighty-first
Congress. That bill was not enacted into law, and two bills iden­
tical to it, H. R. 3978 and H. R. 8524, were introduced in the
Eighty-second Congress. These bills also failed of enactment.
The Judicial Conference may therefore wish to consider action
urging the reintroduction and eventual enactment of a similar bill
in the Eighty-third Congress.
                                 36 


   Transfer of jurisdiction over probationers to districts of resi­
dence.-In administering probation, it is the practice of many
judges to retain jurisdiction over a probationer for the whole
period of probation even after he has been permitted to transfer
his residence to another jurisdiction. Thus, if the probationer is
arrested after such change of'residence for violating the provisions
of probation, it is necessary to return him to the district and court
of original jurisdiction for appropriate action by that court. From
an administrative point of view, it would seem that this procedure
is not as satisfactory as the transfer of jurisdiction over and super­
vision of transferred probationers to the courts of the districts into
which they have moved. During the fiscal year 1952, such a trans­
fer of jurisdiction occurred in less than 10 percent of the nearly
3,000 cases where probationers were permitted to move from one
district to another. Thus, more than 90 per'cent of such proba­
tioners were under the jurisdiction of judges in districts where they
no longer resided. It would seem that the transfer of jurisdiction
in these cases of removal would result not only in monetary savings
but in a possibility of more effective supervision, and we submit
for the consideration of this body the suggestion that such trans­
fers of jurisdiction be made the rule rather than the exception.
   Inadequate sentences in immigration cases.-In the operations
of the Immigration and N aturaIization Service the enforcement
of the immigration laws is, of course, a matter of primary concern.
Inevitably, the effective administration of those laws must depend
both upon a high morale among the enforcing officers and the cer­
tainty of quick punishment on the part of those who would violate
them. It would help considerably if, in the judicial districts along
our national borders where violations of these provisions most often
occur, the judges would use their power of sentencing more strin­
gently particularly in the cases of persistent violators.
   Inadequate sentences in prisoner ofJenses.-A similar problem
 appears to exist in the sentencing of prison inmates for escapes,
 assaults, and other offenses committed during incarceration. In a
 few instances sentencing judges have taken the view that such
 crimes called for only nominal punishment. If this view were to
 obtain wide acceptance it would seriously impede the proper ad­
 ministration of our federal prison system. The threat of certain
 and substantial punishment by an authority disassociated from the
prison administration itself is a most important deterrent to prison
violence.

                  III. MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

   Bill creat'tng additional judgeships.-At the meeting of this Con­
ference a year ago, the Attorney General was able to report to you
that the creation of a number of judgeships, as recommended by
this body, had been proposed in a bill, S. 1203, then pending before
the Congress. Unfortunately the bill was not enacted into law in
the Eighty-second Congress. The Judicial Conference may there­
fore wish to renew its recommendation as to the creation of addi­
tional judgeships by the Eighty-third Congress.
   Bills relating to testimony of judges.-In his remarks to the
Conference last year the Attorney General referred to the bill,
H. R. 486, which would have prohibited any Justice of the United
States from testifying "as to the character or reputation of any
person or as to any matter of opinion in any action in any court
of the United States." A similar bill, H. R. 5428, which would
extend the prohibition to Judges of the United States as well as
Justices and which omits the reference to "any matter of opinion"
was also introduced in the Eighty-second Congress. Neither of
these bills was enacted.
   Bills establishing attorneys' liens.-Proposals were made in both
Houses of the Eighty-second Congress to provide for attorneys'
liens in proceedings before the courts or other departments and
agencies of the United States. This lien would have attached
from the commencement of any proceeding or the service of an
answer containing a counterclaim, and would have given any at­
torney, whose appearance had been entered for a party, a lien upon
his client's cause of action. This lien would attach to any verdict
 or other determination in his client's favor and to the proceeds
 thereof in whatever hands they might come. The bills also pro­
vided that no statute forbidding or limiting the assignment of a
claim against the Lnited States would be deemed to apply to a
lien thus established. The two bills differed as to enforcement of
 the lien, the House version leaving such enforcement in the first
instance to the court or government agency which had made the
final determination to which the lien attached, and the Senate
bill entrusting enforcement entirely to the courts. The Depart­
ment of Justice objected to both bills, noting the danger of govern­
ment embroilment in disputes between attorney and client and
 the undesirability of placing Executive agencies under the neces­
                                  38 


sityof adjudicating rights as between client and attorney. Neither
of these two bills was enacted into law.
   Bills affecting the jury system.-Several bills affecting the Fed­
eral jury system were proposed in the Eighty-second Congress.
Proposals to provide a jury commission in each United States dis­
trict court were submitted and met with no objection from the
Department of Justice, but were not enacted. Other bills intro­
duced related to the extension of the privilege of jury trial to cer­
tain cases arising within the special maritime and territorial
jurisdiction of the United States. To these bills the Department
interposed certain objections. In addition, proposals were made
to establish uniform qualifications for jurors, to require Federal
jurors to take an oath of allegiance, to authorize the appointment
of special counsel and investigators in certain cases to assist grand
juries in the exercise of their powers, and to permit all civil actions
against the United States for recovery of certain taxes to be
brought in the district courts with the right of trial by jury. None
of these bills was enacted.
   Amendment to Migratory Bird Treaty Act.-The Migratory
Bird Treaty Act of July 3,1918, as amended (16 U. S. C. 703-711),
seems to have resulted in the bringing in the district courts of a
large number of relatively minor cases. It may please this Con­
ference to know, therefore, that the Department of Justice is in­
cluding in its legislative program for the coming year a proposed
amendment to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act which would make
applicable the provisions of Sections 3041 and 3042 of Title 18 so as
to give United States commissioners jurisdiction over offenses
under the act.
   International judicial assistance and procedure.-The end of
hostilities in 1945 and the resumption of world-wide commerce and
 business brought to both Federal and state courts an unprece­
dented amount of litigation with international ramifications-­
 cases in which judicial papers must be served abroad, or records
 or witnesses must be examined within the territory of a foreign
 state, or in which proof must be offered of the law prevailing in a
 foreign jurisdiction. These cases pose problems of procedure which
 are often baffling and sometimes insoluble in the present state of
 the law. They emphasize the need in the international field of the
 same expert study and codification which have brought about
 historical reforms of Federal procedure in the Federal Rules of
 Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
                                 39 

   Extra-territorial procedure now depends largely upon usage and
custom, and it is difficult for the practicing lawyer to ascertain
what steps should be taken in a given instance. The provisions of
the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure and of the state
practice acts for the taking of evidence abroad are often frustrated
by prohibitions and limitations put upon their use by foreign gov­
ernments. Many countries forbid the taking of depositions within
their territories. Even where our deposition practice is permitted
or tolerated, there is no provision in civil law jurisdictions for
obtaining the testimony of an unwilling witness. When witnesses
refuse to testify, or if they are found in a country where our de­
position practice is forbidden, recourse must be had to letters
rogatory. Borrowed from the civil law, a letter rogatory is, in our
practice, a request by a domestic court to a court of a foreign coun­
try to take evidence. It is, of course, executed according to the
law of and in the language of the foreign country. Procedure in
civil law countries is so different from ours that American lawyers
avoid using letters rogatory wherever possible. Moreover, the
courts of some countries, such as The Netherlands and Germany,
are unable to issue compulsory process even to aid in the execution
of a letter rogatory issuing from an American court because the
United Stat€s has not entered into procedural treaties with their
governments. Courts of limited jurisdiction and administrative
tribunals which cannot promise reciprocity, a time honored condi­
tion of letters rogatory, are without means of obtaining testimony
abroad from unwilling witnesses found in civil law countries.
   Foreign courts find equally unsatisfactory the limited judicial
assistance which American courts are able to render them. From
time to time over the last hundred years, several countries have
offered to enter into agreements with the United States to correct
deficiencies of int€ r national practice. Yet the United States
remains the only country of major importance which has not
entered into treaties or conventions codifying international legal
procedure. Practice can be simplified, expedited, and rendered
more certain and less expensive by treaty. Much of Latin America
and Europe is covered by a network of procedural treaties. Great
Britain has entered into 22. This is a good demonstration that the
common law and the civil law systems can be coordinated pro­
cedurally_ Furthermore, an excellent start in drafting has already
been made by the Harvard Research in International Law, which
in 1939 published a Draft Convention on Judicial Assistance. Con­
                                40 

siderable improvement in practice can probably be effected by·
informal agreement.
   Responsibility for reform must be assumed by the Federal gov­
ernment because there is little that the individual states can do by
themselves to improve their international juridical relations,
Many of the important bar associations, including the American
Bar Association, have urged initiation of action by the Federal
government. Accordingly, it has been proposed to the President
that there be established a small governmental commission, to be
headed by the Attorney General of the United States and compris­
ing representatives of the Departments of Justice and State, and
of the Federal judiciary, to study existing international practices.
of judicial assistance available to state and Federal courts and
administrative tribunals, With a view to reform, the commission,
would draft for the assistance of the Secretary of State interna­
tional agreements to be negotiated by him and would draft and
r~commend for presentation by the President any necessary legis­
lation and other action advisable in the improvement and codifica­
tion of international practice. It was felt that this small govern­
mental commission should be aided by a larger advisory committee·
consisting of lawyers, judges, and law teachers, selected for their
practical experience in international litigation, their eminence as
procedural experts, or their accomplishments in the field of
international or comparative law.
   The proposal has the informal approval of the President. How~
 ever, because the establishment of such a commission and advisory
 committee would require financing which is not now available, it
 was deemed best to defer the establishment of the proposed com~
 mission until such time as congressional authorization and appro~"
 priations could be obtained-which will not be before 1953.
