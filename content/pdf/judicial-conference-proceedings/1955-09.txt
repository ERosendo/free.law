   The Judicial Conference of the United States convened pur­

 Justice presided and members of the Conference were present

   The Conference welcomed the new Chief Judge for the District
 of Columbia Circuit, Honorable Henry White Edgerton, succeed­
 ing Chief Judge Harold M. Stephens who died on May 28, 1955.
 The Conference adopted the following resolution:
       The Judicial Conference of the United States records with
     profound sorrow the death of Chief Judge Harold M. Ste­
     phens. When we realize that he will be with us no more,
     we all feel the great personal loss of one whom we revered
     and admired. We shall miss his sound and wholesome advice
     and his suggestions which were based both upon his long
     and distinguished judicial career and also upon his experience
     at the Bar.
       Judge Stephens was successful as a practicing lawyer. He
     had experience as a trial judge in the state courts of Utah.
     He was an assistant attorney general of the United States,
     which was followed by 20 years' service as a judge of the
     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
                                      (1)
                                  2

      Circuit. For more than 7 years before his death, he was a
      member of this Conference.
         The work of this Conference commanded the intense in­
      terest of Judge Stephens. His great industry and his zeal
                                                                          -

      for the effective administration of justice in the federal courts
      resulted in his making many important contributions to the
      work of this Conference. His attainments were many. We
      all profited by his wisdom and his sound judgment. We
      shall long remember his intense devotion to his judicial duties
      and to the carrying out of the decisions and the determinations
      of this Conference.
   The Acting Attorney General, William P. Rogers, attended the
morning session on the opening day of the Conference.
   Circuit Judges Albert B. Maris, Alfred P. Murrah, and Elbert
Parr Tuttle, and District Judges Harry E. Watkins, Marion S.
Boyd, and Roy W. Harper, attended all or some of the sessions.
   The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts, Henry P. Chandler, the Assistant Director, Elmore White­

other members of the staff of the Administrative Office attended
the sessions of the conference.

                REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

   Acting Attorney General William P. Rogers presented a report
to the Conference in place of Attorney General Herbert Brownell,
Jr., who was out of the country. The report appears in the
appendix.
REPORT OF THE DmECToR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE
                      UNITED STATES COURTS

   Pursuant to the statute (28 U. S. C. 604 (a) (3)) the Director
had previously submitted to the members of the Conference his
16th annual report on the activities of his office for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1955, including a report of the Chief of the Divi­
sion of Procedural Studies and Statistics on the state of the busi­       ..... 

                                     3




-   ness of the courts. The Conference approved the immediate re­
    lease of the report for publication and authorized the Director
    to revise and supplement it in the final printed edition to be
    issued later.
                         BUSINESS OF THE COURTS

       State of the docket8 of the Federal court8-court8 of appeals.­
    The number of cases begun in the courts of appeals increased by a
    little more than 200 over 1954 to a total of 3,695 in the fiscal year
    1955. The increase has occurred in appeals from the courts, which
    have shown a steady upward trend since 1950, probably the result
    of a continuous increase in the number of contested cases and trials
    in the district courts and also the increased number of district
    judges. The number of cases terminated was 3,654 only slightly
    less than the number begun, leaving 2,175 pending on June 30,
    1955. There was an increase of 60 percent in cases begun in the
    Second Circuit. Also there were increases of some importance in
    the First and Third Circuits. The Ninth Circuit showed a large
    decrease but still has a heavy pending caseload. The median time
    from filing to final disposition for cases heard and decided in­

o   creased fractionally to 7.3 months but was considerably longer in
    the Ninth Circuit (15.8 months) and in the Sixth Circuit (10.3
    months). For the first 4 numbered circuits and the Tenth Cir­
    cuit, it was less than 6 months.
       The number of petitions for certiorari from the courts of appeals
     to the Supreme Court was slightly more than last year and the
    number granted was 96 or 17 percent of the number acted on com­
     pared with 70 or 13 percent in the fiscal year 1954.
        Di8trict courts.-Growing congestion in many district courts is
     shown by the increase in the number of pending civil cases during
     the year and the rise in the time required from filing to disposition
     of cases which are tried. This is a matter of serious concern to
     the Conference. In districts where 2 and even sometimes 3 years
     expire from the time answer is filed in a civil case to the date when
    it is tried, litigants are being denied that prompt service which
     the Federal courts should give.
        The number of private civil cases filed annually-and this is by
     far the most time-consuming part of the courts' business--has
     more than doubled since the end of World War II and the pending
private cases have almost tripled. The figures for the fiscal years
1945, 1950, and 1955 are as follows:

                                                                             Private civil cases
                                                                                                                ­

   Each year since 1943 the number of private civil cases begun has
exceeded the number terminated and the phenomenal growth in the
number of pending cases ie the result.
   In the fiscal year 1955, the total of all cases filed, including both
cases in which the Government was a party and those between only
private litigants, was 59,375 or a few cases less than the number
filed during the previous year. Cases terminated were 58,974 or
over a thousand more than in 1954. The number of pending civil
cases went up to 68,832.
   The median interval from filing to disposition of civil cases in
which a trial was held terminated in the district courts in the 86
districts having only Federal jurisdiction rose over a month to 14.6
                                                                                                                c
months and there were 25 districts, which are listed in the annual
report of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, in
which the time for disposition exceeded the national median. From
issue to trial, the median time interval for the 86 districts was 9.1
months.
   Among the congested districts some improvement has taken
place in the Southern District of New York where the civil calendar
has been reduced by almost 600 cases and the time for reaching trial
 (although still 38 months for personal injury jury cases) has been
materially shortened.
    The criminal business of the district courts has shown only a
small change since the war if immigration cases arising in the dis­
tricts on the Mexican border are eliminated. The number of
criminal cases pending is small in comparison with the number filed
during the year. In 1955, the number of cases filed was 35,310.
Terminations were in excess of filings and 8,643 cases were pending
at the end of the year of which 1,747 could not be tried because they
involved fugitives or other defendants who were not in Federal
          custody. Criminal cases receive priority and generally speaking
          the criminal dockets are in satisfactory condition.
             While bankruptcy cases increased, the rate of increase has
          dropped, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year 1955. The
          increase in the past year was in voluntary bankruptcy petitions
          filed by individuals and not in business failures. Cases terminated
          increased by 8,700 over 1954 but still were less than the cases begun.
          The pending caseload rose to 55,592 which was higher than at any
          previous year's end since 1941.
             Cases and motions under advisement.-A report was presented
          to the Conference listing the cages and motions under advisement
          more than 6 months on September 1, with such explanations in
          reference to them as had been furnished to the Administrative Of­
          fice by the judges concerned. The number of such cases and mo­
          tions was reported as 19, not including some cases reported as closed.
          Of that number, reports indicated that all but 8 would be disposed
          of by October 1. Where necessary these will be brought to the
          attention of the judicial council of the circuit by the chief judge.
                       ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS RECOMMENDED

 o
          Because of changed conditions, the Conference withdrew the
          recommendation heretofore made that an additional judgeship be
          provided for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on a temporary
          basis. It also withdrew its previous recommendation for an addi­
          tional district judgeship for the District of Arizona. With these
          two exceptions, the Conference reaffirmed its previous recommen­
          dations with respect to the creation of additional judgeships (Cf.
          Rpt. Mar. 1955, sess. p. 2).
            The Conference recommended the creation of the following
          judgeships not heretofore recommended by the Conference:
                 1 additional district judgeship for the Eastern District of
               Pennsylvania.
                 1 additional district judgeship for the District of Maryland.
                 1 additional district judgeship for the Western District of
              Texas.
            A proposal that one additional district judgeship be recom­
          mended for the Western District of Washington was considered
,......   and rejected.

-   DISAPPROVAL OF CREATION OF ANY ADDITIONAL JUDICIAL DISTRICTS
      The Conference reaffirmed the following resolution which was
    adopted at the September 1948 session (Cf. Rpt. p. 35):
           "BE IT RESOLVED, That, henceforth, the Judicial Conference
        of the United States will definitely oppose the creation of any
        additional judicial district; and where it is found that addi­
        tional judicial service is necessary, it will recommend that
        such service be provided by the creation of additional judge­
        ships within the then existing judicial districts."

    DISAPPROVAL OF PROPOSED CREATION OF ADDITIONAL DIVISION IN
              THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
      The Conference approved the following resolution which was
    adopted by the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit at its
    session held June 28-30,1955:
           "WHEREAS, Director Chandler has requested that the
        Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit advise the Judicial Con­
        ference of the United States whether or not it should recom­
o       mend that Congress enact H. J. 515 and the identical H. J.
        516; (these provide for creating in the United States District
        Court for the Northern District of California a new Eastern
        Division by taking from the present Southern Division the
        Counties of Alameda and Contra Costa. This Eastern
        Division would hold its sessions in the City of Oakland, County
        of Alameda, a distance of about ten miles from San Francisco
        where the judges of the Southern Division now entertain
        litigation of that Division.)
           "AND WHEREAS, the combined round trip time to go by
        automobile or train transportation from Oakland cross San
        Francisco Bay through San Francisco and return is not over
        an hour;
           "AND WHEREAS, the creation of such a new division would
        require the cost of construction in Oakland of
        (a) a courtroom, (b) a judge's three room chambers for the
        judge, his law clerk and his secretary, rooms for the accommo­
        dation of juries of men and women, one or more Assistant
        United States Attorneys, for deputy marshals and their
        prisoners, clerk of the court and his deputies, a crier, court
                                 8

    reporters, probation officers, a library and the books of the
    library and other court facilities;
       "AND WHEREAS, we are advised by Mr. Chambers of the
    General Services Administration that Congress would be
    compelled to appropriate at least $1,000,000 to supply these
    facilities for the proposed Eastern Division if in a proper
    structure and not less than $400,000 if, by removing the present
    occupants of the Post Office Building and paying very large
    rentals for their offices elsewhere, their quarters were con­
    verted to an adequate courtroom and the above offices;
       "AND WHEREAS, if the 10 miles of travel between Oakland
    and San Francisco warrant the creation of such an Eastern
    Division, there would be a greater warrant for the creation of
    another division in the San Jose area, some 50 miles from San
    Francisco, consisting of the surrounding counties; ...
       "It was resolved that the Conference take the same position
    as that of the Judicial Council of the Circuit and register its
    disapproval of the establishment of a division of the above
    district court."
.\PPOINTMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL JUDGE WHEN ADISABLED JUDGE
                     FAILS TO RETIRE                                    o
  The Conference reaffirmeG its recommendation made at the April
1954 special session (Cf. Rpt. p. 3), the September 1954 session (Cf.
Rpt. p. 7), and the March 1955 special session (Cf. Rpt. p. 4) that
the repealed statute which permitted the President to appoint an
additional judge when a disabled judge eligible to retire failed to
do so and the President found tha,t such an appointment was neces­
sary for the efficient dispatch of business, be amended in the form
recommended by the Conference and reenacted. The recommen­
dation of the Conference is embodied in H. R. 4792 which passed
the House in the first session of the 84th Congress and is pending
before the Judiciary Committee of the Senate.

PROPOSED DESIGNATION OF RETIRED JUDGES AS "SENIOR JUDGES"
  The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation made at the
March 1955 session (Cf. Rpt. p. 4) that § 371 (b) of Title 28,
United States Code, be amended so as to designate a judge taking
advantage of the retirement provisions as a "senior judge" instead
                                        9

      of a "retired judge" as at present and to provide that a roster to
-     be known as the "Roster of Senior Judges" be maintained by the
      Chief Justice of retired judges willing and able to undertake special
      judicial duties upon assignment by him when and as needed. This
      recommendation of the Conference is embodied in H. R. 6248 which
      passed the House of Representatives at the first session of the 84th
      Congress and is pending before the Judiciary Committee of the
      Senate.
      JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORTING PERsONNEL
              AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION

         Chief Judge Biggs, who is chairman of the Committee on Sup­
      porting Personnel and also chairman of the Committee on Court
      Administration, made a joint report for the two Committees. He
      informed the Conference that because the subjects which had been
      refelTed to the Committee on Supporting Personnel are also among
      the subjects which the Committee on Court Administration had
      been authorized to consider, and the 2 Committees had the same
      chairman and 1 additional member in common, it seemed to him

c
    appropriate that the 2 Committees hold a joint session, which had
      been done.
                          ADDITIONAL DEPUTY CLERKS

         After considering the increase volume of work in the clerks' of­
      fices of the United States courts both Committees were of the view
      that need for 50 more deputy clerks in addition to 25 added posi­
      tions provided for in the appropriation for the current fiscal year is
      clearly indicated and that even this number may not be adequate.
      They therefore recommended that sufficient funds be included in
      the budget estimates for the fiscal year 1957 to permit the employ­
      ment of this number of additional deputy clerks, to be classified
      by the Administrative Office in accordance with present standards.
      The recommendation was adopted by the Conference.
                            THE PROBATION SERVICE

        Additional Probation Officers.-The Committees reported that
      the 316 Federal probation officers presently have an average work­
      load of 115 per officer. The workload is computed by giving a
t""   weight of 1 to each person under supervision and a weight of 4 to
'-r   each presentence investigation, it being considered that on the
                                  10 

average an investigation requires 4 times as much time as super­
vision of 1 person. This is a method of computation approved by
correctional authorities. Additional funds available in the appro­
priation for the current fiscal year will permit the appointment of
71 additional probation officers which will reduce the average work­
load per officer to 94. The Administrative Office considers that a
desirable standard is an average workload of 75 per officer, although
this is above the load of 50 recommended by some authorities in
the field.
   To reduce the average workload of Federal probation officers to
75 the addition of 115 officers to those presently in service or author­
ized under the current appropriation act will be required. This
number would also fulfill the recommendation made by the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary on Juvenile Delinquency (S. Rept.
No. 61, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 109). Accordingly the two Com­
mittees recommended that funds be included in the budget esti­
mates for the fiscal year 1957 to permit the appointment of 115 ad­
ditional probation officers. The recommendation was approved by
the Conference.
   Clerical Assistance to Probation Officers.-The Committees re­
ported that the appointment of 115 additional probation officers
will require the services of 124 additional clerk-stenographers. The
                                                                           o
Committees therefore recommended and the Conference approved
the inclusion of sufficient funds in the budget estimates for 1957 to
provide for this additional number of clerk-stenographers in the
Probation Service as the need arises.
   Compensation of Probation Personnel.-The Committees re­
ported that they found the salaries of Federal probation officers to
be substantially lower than those of officers in most Federal law en­
forcement agencies and also in many State probation systems and
that they considered it necessary that probation officers be reclassi­
fied if competent men are to be employed and retained. They
therefore recommended the following changes in the presently ex­
isting plan of classification of probation officers:
   1. That the entrance grade and salary for probation officers be
increased from $4,525 per annum, grade GS-7, to $5,440 per annum
in grade GS-9.
   2. That the ceilings for probation officers be raised from GS-lO
to grade GS-11; for deputy chief probation officers from grade GS­
11 to grade GS-13; for chief probation officers in the smaller of­
                                      11 




-   fices from grade GS-ll to grade GS-13 ; and that the chief probation
    officers of the metropolitan districts be raised from grade GS-12 to
    grade GS-14.
        3. That a new position of Supervising Probation Officer be cre­
    ated to be allocated to grade GS-12.
        The Conference adopted these recommendations and authorized
    the inclusion of sufficient funds in the budget estimates for 1957 to
    make them effective.
        Standards for Probation O/ficers.-The Conference recom­
    mended in 1942 (Cf. Rpt. Sept. 1942 sess. pp. 9-10) and reaffirmed
    in 1954 (Cf. Rpt. Apr. sess. 1954, pp. 21-22) the following stand­
    ards of qualifications for probation offic~rs:
         (1) Exemplary character.
         (2) Good health and vigor.
         (3) An age at the time of appointment within the range of
     24 to 45 years inclusive.
         (4) A liberal education of not less than collegiate grade, evi­
     denced by a bachelor's degree (B. A. or B. S.) from a college of
     recognized standing, or its equivalent.
         (5) Experience in personnel work for th~ welfare of others of not
c    less than 2 years, or 2 years of specific training for welfare work (a)
     in a school of social service of recognized standing, or (b) in a
     professional course of a college or university of recognized standing,
        The Committees reported that while these standards had been
     adhered to in most instances, there have been deviations and that
     the deviations had been emphasized by the Subcommittee of the
     Senate Committee on the Judiciary to Study Juvenile Delinquency,
     which had recommended that the standards be made mandatory,
     The Committees of the Judicial Conference therefore recom­
     mended that the Judicial Conference recommend to Congress the
     enactment of appropriate legislation empowering the Judicial
     Conference to promulgate minimum standards which must be met
     by all probation officers to be appointed in the future. The
     Conference adopted the recommendation.
         The Chicago Service Training Center.-To improve the facili­
      ties of the Chicago Service Training Center for the training of
      newly appointed probation officers, the Committees recommended
      the following additions to the budget of the Training Center to be
      included in the budget estimates for the United States Courts for
      the next fiscal year:
                                                  12 

1. Assistant director of training in grade GS-12 .........                                    $7, 570 
   ~
2. Two probation officer instructors in grade GS-ll at                                                    ..
     $6,390. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..   12, 780
3. One secretary-librarian in grade GS-5. . . . . . . . . . . . . ..                           3, 670
4. Books and materials, including visual aids. . . . . . . . . . . .                              300
5. Special stipends for outside instructional services. . . . ..                               1, 000

          Total addition to the annual budget for the Train­
           ing Center ................................. 25,320 

   The recommended additions were approved by the Conference,
and the Administrative Office was instructed to include the addi­
tional amount in the budget estimates for the Chicago Service
Training Center for the next fiscal year.
   Deficiencies in Appropriations for Travel Limiting the Proba­
tion Service.-The Committees informed the Conference that a
large deficiency in the travel funds available for probation officers
had reacted adversely on the functioning of the probation service
as a whole and on the Chicago Service Training Center in particu­
lar. The Committees therefore recommended that every effort
be made to have included in the appropriation for the United                                              0

States courts sufficient funds for travel to permit the probation                                             .
service as a whole to function properly and also to take maximum
advantage of the facilities of the Chicago Center. The Confer­
ence approved this recommendation.
                   CLASSIFICATION OF CLERK-STENOGRAPHERS

   The Committees reported that it had been found, as a practical
matter, impossible to secure satisfactory stenographers in grades
lower than GS-4 in many areas. Accordingly they recommended
that all clerk-stenographers in the supporting personnel of the
courts below that grade be reclassified to grade GS-4 and that
hereafter grade GS-4 be established as a minimum grade for en­
tering clerk-stenographers. The Conference approved this rec­
ommendation and authorized the inclusion of sufficient funds in the
budget estimates for the fiscal year 1957 to carry it into effect.
       SURVEY OF CLASSIFICATIONS OF OTHER COURT PERSONNEL

  The Committees informed the Conference that consideration
had been given to recommendations for reclassifications of other                                          A
                                     13 




-
    supporting personnel of the courts including law clerks, secretaries,
    and secretary-law clerks to judges, and clerks of court and their
    deputies. The Committees were of the opinion that because of
    the interrelationship of the grades of these positions they should
    not be considered piecemeal. Also the Committees considered
    that additional information was needed in order to determine fair
    compensation for these employees. Accordingly they recom­
    mended that the Conference direct the Administrative Office to
    make a further survey of the grades and salaries of the supporting
    personnel of the courts for submission to the Committees and that
    the Committees be authorized to consider the survey and make fur­
    ther recommendations on the subject to the Conference as soon as
    possible. The Conference adopted the recommendation.
                      NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS

       The attention of the Conference was directed to the fact that
    the national park commissioners have not received the benefits of
    the 71h-percent pay raise given to Federal employees generally by
    the Federal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1955, Public Law 94,
    84th Congress, first session, because pursuant to Title 28, U. S. C.,
    § 634, the salaries of these commissioners are fixed by the district
    courts of the districts in which the parks are situated with the
    approval of the Conference. The Committees recommended that
    the Conference inform the district courts that it would approve
    increases in the compensation of national park commissioners to
    the extent of 71h percent retroactive to March 14, 1955, the effec­
    tive date of Public Law 94 with respect to the salaries of other
    court employees. The Conference adopted the recommendation.
    MATTERS RELATING PARTICULARLY TO THE COMMITTEE ON COURT
                             ADMINISTRATION

       The Conference received and approved the report of the Com­
    mittee on Court Administration that it is presently engaged in
    seeking information on subjects germane to the functioning of the
    courts and their supporting personnel which would be considered at
    a further meeting of the Committee scheduled to be held N ovem­
    ber 1 and 2, 1955.
      The following additional matters were referred to the Committee
    on Court Administration for consideration and recommendation
    to the Conference:
         370990-56---3
                                 14 


    1. The question whether the creation of any additional divisions   ~
of judicial districts ought to be opposed.                             ""
    2. A proposal offered by Judge Denman that whenever a chief
judge of a circuit determines that he needs the services of two law
clerks he be authorized to appoint that number.
    3. A bill (H. R. 7161) pending before the Judiciary Committee
of the House of Representatives to provide that chief judges of
circuits and district courts shall no longer serve as chief judges
upon reaching the age of 75 years.
   4. A bill (S. 2359) pending before the Judiciary Committee of
the Senate to provide that the President shall designate from
time to time one of the circuit judges in active service in the
circuit as chief judge of the circuit.
    5. A bill (H. R. 5884) which has passed the House of Repre­
sentatives and is pending before the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations which would increase the fee for execution of a pass­
port application before the clerk of a State court from $1 to $3
but would not increase the fee of $1 for the execution of such
applications before clerks of United States district courts.
   6. A bill (H. R. 91) pending before the Judiciary Committee
of the House of Representatives which would provide that diver­
sity of citizenship cases could be removed from State courts to
                                                                       e

I·'ederal courts only if the amount in controversy exceeds the sum
of $15,000.
    7. A bill (H. R. 5007) pending before the Judiciary Committee
of the House of Representatives which would raise to $10,000 the
jurisdictional amount both in Federal question and diversity of
citizenship cases, and would further provide that the diversity of
citizenship jurisdiction should apply only to cases affecting in­
dividuals, thus excluding corporations.
   8. A proposal offered by Judge Edgerton that a study of ways
and means of shortening trials be suggested to a foundation as an
appropriate subject for investigation in the public interest.

       COMPENSATION OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

  The Director recommended that consideration be given to the
rate of compensation of United States Commissioners, pointing
out that there has been no change in the fees authorized for their
                                                       15 




-
    services since 1946 and that a bill (H. R. 7363) is pending in the
    House of Representatives which would increase the existing limit
    of $7,500 per year on the basic fees which a Commissioner may
    receive to $10,000. The matter was referred to the Committee
    on Supporting Personnel of the Courts for consideration and re­
    port to the Conference.
                               BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

       Chief Judge Phillips, chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy
    Administration, reported that the Committee had met and con­
    sidered the recommendations contained in the report of the Bank­
    ruptcy Division of the Administrative Office which was approved
    by the Director on August 15, 1955, relating to certain changes
    in salaries and arrangements of referees and to the filling of va­
    cancies in certain referees' positions.
       The report had been circulated by the Director among the dis­
    trict judges and the judicial councils concerned, also among the
    members of the Judicial Conference. The Committee on Bank­
    ruptcy Administration had considered it and the recommendations
    of the district judges and judicial councils, and these with the
o   report of the Committee were before the Conference.
       Upon the recommendation of the Committee the Conference

  2 The part-time pOsition at Salisbury was discontinued etl'ectl"".J an. 1, 1956, as no longer needed, the entire
District of Maryland to be served by the fuIl·tlme referee at Baltimore. Easton and Salisbury are deslg.
nated as places of holding court for the Baltimore referee.


  Sixth Circuit-Western District of Kentucky.-The Committee
recommended and the Conference approved the filling of the va­
cancy in the office of referee in bankruptcy at Louisville, Ky.,
caused by the death of Referee Hite H. Huffaker on June 20,1955,
for a term of 6 years on a full-time basis at a salary of $11,250
a year; the regular place of office of the new appointee to be at
Louisville, Ky.
                                 CHANGES IN ARRANGEMENTS

   The following changes in arrangements for referees were rec­
ommended by the Committee and approved by the Conference:
   Third Circuit-Western District of Pennsylvania.-That the
regular place of office of the referee formerly located at Ebens­
burg, be changed to Johnstown and that Ebensburg be discon­
tinued and Johnstown designated as a place of holding court for
the referee now located at Johnstown.
   Fourth Circuit-Eastern District of Virginia.-That the coun­
ties of Elizabeth City and Warwick, be stricken from the list of
counties included in the territory of the Norfolk referee and that
the city of Hampton and the city of Warwick be added to such
territory.
   Seventh Circuit-Eastern District of Illinois.                                                                                "'"
                                  17 

   1. That an additional part-time referee be appointed effective
January 1, 1956, at a salary of $6,000 per annum, for a term of
6 years, to serve the counties of Fayette, Clinton, Marion, Monroe,
Washington, Jefferson, Randolph, Perry, Franklin, Hamilton,
Jackson, Williamson, Saline, Gallatin, Union, Johnson, Pope,
Hardin, Alexander, Pulaski, Massac and St. Clair; the regular
place of office to be at East St. Louis, Illinois, with places of hold­
ing court designated at East St. Louis and Cairo.
   2. That the territory of the Danville referee be changed effec­
tive January 1, 1956, to include only the counties of Kankakee,
Iroquois, Ford, Champaign, Piatt, Moultrie, Shelby, Douglas, Ed­
gar, Coles, Clark, Cumberland, Effingham, Jasper, Crawford, Clay,
Richland, Lawrence, Wayne, Edwards, Wabash, White and
Vermilion.
   3. That East St. Louis and Cairo be discontinued as places of
holding court for the Danville referee, effective January 1, 1956.
   4. That the salary of the Danville referee be fixed at $5,000 a
year, effective January 1, 1956.
   Ninth Circuit-District of Nevada.-That the regular place of
office of the referee formerly located at Reno, be changed to Las
Vegas and that Reno be continued as a place of holding bank­
ruptcy court for the referee at Las Vegas.
   The Committee recommended and the Conference authorized
the Director to seek at the first opportunity a supplemental ap­
propriation for 1956 for referees' salaries in an amount sufficient
to defray the cost of the above changes in salaries and arrange­
ments approved by the Conference.
   At the meeting of the Conference in March 1955, the Bank­
ruptcy Committee was authorized to study Section 60 of the
Bankruptcy Act and related sections with a view to proposing
legislation to clarify their meaning. Thereafter the chairman of
the Committee appointed the following Subcommittee to study
the matter: Circuit Judge John B. Sanborn, Chairman, District
Judge H. Church Ford, Member, and Edwin L. Covey, Adviser.
   The Subcommittee reported the results of its study thus far.
The Committee recommended that the Subcommittee be con­
tinued for further study and report to the full Committee. The
recommendation of the Committee was approved by the Con­
ference.
   Chief Judge Phillips brought to the attention of the Conference a
draft of a proposed revision of Section 5Se of the Bankruptcy Act
                                    18 

relating to orders and notices in bankruptcy now required to be
given to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Director of
Internal Revenue and the Comptroller General. The purpose
of the proposal is to reduce the number of such orders and notices
relating to the date of adjudication in bankruptcy. The proposal
which has the approval of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
would eliminate two of the documents now required by Section
58e to be mailed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in
Washington but would continue the one sent to the local Director.
With the decentralization of the Internal Revenue Service that
agency will rely on the notice sent to the local Director. The
Comptroller General will rely on the single notice sent to him in
Washington. The Committee recommended the approval of the
following draft of an amendment to Section 58e:
      e. !};.he elePIf shatl ~ tie the Gonllnissionep e4l Ini;el'nal Revenue
    anti tie the Gomptpollef' GeneFM e4l the United Stft.tee & ceptified
    ~ e4l ~ eP4eP e4l adjl:ldication forthwM i:li*ffi the ent¥y­
    thereof. The court shall, in every case instituted under any pro­
    visions of this Act, mail or cause to be mailed a copy of the notice
    of the first meeting of creditors tie the Gmrunissionm:' e4l Intel'llal
    RCV:CE:l:lC to the collectop district director of internal revenue for
    the district in which the court is located,' and to the Comptroller
    General of the United States. Whenever the schedules of the
    bankrupt, or the list of creditors of the bankrupt, or any other
    papers filed in the case disclose a debt to the United States acting
    through any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof,
     (except for any internal revenue obligation payable to the Secre­
    tary:Ofthe'I'reasuryorhis delegate fa notice of the first meeting
    shall be mailed as well to the head of such department, agency, or
    instrumentality.
       (Deleted matter stricken and added matter underscored.)
   In connection with the proposal to amend Section 58e the Com­
mittee also recommended that the Conference reaffirm its approval
of legislation that would provide for the combining of notices of the
time fixed for filing objections to the discharge of the bankrupt
with the notice of the first meeting of creditors whenever possible,
Both recommendations were approved by the Conference.
   The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
previous action recommending that the foHowing maximum rates
of compensation for trustees be provided by amendment of Sec­
tion 48c (1) of the Bankruptcy Act, to wit:
                                         19 

    10 percent on the first___________________________________________     $500.00

     3 percent on the next___________________________________________ 8,500.00
     2 percent on the next___________________________________________ 15,000.00

    together with an increase in the discretionary allowance from $100 as now pro­
    vided in such subsection to the sum of $150.00.
      The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
    previous action recommending an amendment of Section 66 re­
    garding unclaimed moneys in bankruptcy proceedings (Cf. Rpt.
    Sept. 1953 sess. pp. 10-11, Cf. Rpt. Sept. 1954 sess. pp. 14-15).
    The Conference approved this recommendation.
      Chief Judge Denman brought to the attention of the Conference
    the following resolution adopted by the Judicial Conference of
    the Ninth Circuit:
          "RESOLVED, that this Conference refer to the Judicial Con­
       ference of the United States the question as to the need for
       amending Section 7, Section 324 and Section 331 of the Bank­
       ruptcy Act, and to recommend to Congress an amendment
       providing for adequate procedure for filing a Chapter 11 pro­
       ceeding without schedules and statements of affairs where the
       judge or judges are absent from the district, and further pro­
       viding for an order of reference under Chapter 11 by the clerk
       under the same circumstances."
     The resolution was referred to the Committee on Bankruptcy
    Administration for consideration and report.
                        THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM
      The Director submitted a report on the court reporting system
    in which he informed the Conference that in general the income
    of the Federal court reporters has improved continuously through­
    out more than a decade since the system was established. Their
    average annual net income from salary, official transcript fees
    and private reporting during the fiscal year 1955 was $10,191.83.
    The median was $9,197.07.
      The attention of the Conference was directed to the fact that
    the Federal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1955 did not increase
    the salaries of court reporters but section 3 (c) of the Act raised
    the statutory maximum limit upon their salaries from $6,000 to
    $6,450 per year, thus enabling the Conference which has the re­
    sponsibility of fixing the reporters' salaries to take appropriate
                                                 20 

action. Accordingly the Director recommended and the Confer­
ence authorized increases of 7lj2 percent in the salaries of the court
reporters, rounded to the nearest even multiple of $5, effective as
of March 14, 1955, the day on which the increases under the Salary
Increase Act became applicable to other supporting personnel of
the courts. The Director reported that funds are available for
the payment of these increases.
  The Conference voted to fix the salaries of reporters who have
been receiving $4,500 per year at $5,000 per year plus the 7lj2 per­
cent increase to become effective when funds are available, and it
instructed the Director to include funds for this purpose in the
1957 budget estimates.
   Accordingly the annual salary rates for reporters as fixed by the
Conference hereafter are revised as follows:
For reporters who have been receiving:
                                                                                        Annual 8alary

  No additional increases in the salaries of reporters in individual
districts were recommended by the Director or authorized by the
Conference.
                            CHANGES IN ARRANGEMENTS

   The Conference was informed that Judge Mize of the Southern
District of Mississippi had requested that as an alternative to the
combined reporter-secretary position presently authorized for his
district the positions be separated and the appointment of a re­
porter only be authorized. Accordingly, the appointment of a
reporter only for this district was authorized at a salary of $5,375.
   The Conference affirmed an authorization heretofore made by
a mail vote for Judge Lemley of the Eastern and Western Dis~
tricts of Arkansas to appoint a court reporter only in place of a
combined reporter-secretary at a salary of $4,500. Under the
action of the Conference above mentioned the salary of the new
position will be $5,375.
   At the request of Judge Register of the District of North Dakota,
the Conference authorized a combined reporter-secretary position
for his court as an alternative to the position of reporter only here­
                                         21 


        tofore authorized. The salary authorized for the combined posi­
-       tion is $5,915.
                     AIR   CoNDITIONING OF COURT QUARTERS

           Chief Judge Parker, chairman, submitted a report and supple­
        mental report of the Committee on Air Conditioning.
           The Committee reported that in a large part of the country air
        conditioning of courtrooms and quarters of judges and supporting
        personnel is necessary in the interest of efficiency. The practical
        impossibility of holding court during summer months in many
        areas in the absence of air conditioning has led sometimes to long
        vacations and unnecessary delay in disposing of judicial business.
        The Committee was of the opinion that by enabling court to be
        held more comfortably during the summer months air conditioning
        will do much to eliminate long vacations and the delays resulting
        therefrom as well as contribute to the greater efficiency of those
        who are engaged in the work of the courts. The Committee there­
        fore recommended:
           1. That, except in those rare portions of the country where air
        conditioning is not needed during the summer months, air condi­
'wi 	   tioning be provided for all courtrooms and quarters of court per­
        sonnel that are constructed in the future.
           2. That as rapidly as possible, air conditioning be provided in
        existing courtrooms and quarters occupied by court personnel.
           3. That, when court is held in a number of places in a dh;trict
        and it is not necessary to hold court in all places at the same time,
        air conditioning be provided immediately in one of the courtrooms
        and for the chambers of the judge resident within the district,
        without awaiting action with respect to other courtrooms and quar­
        ters of other personneL
           After securing information from all of the courts as to their de­
        sires for air conditioning and obtaining from the judicial councils
        of the circuits their recommendations concerning the needs thus
        expressed, the Committee had prepared a list of places in which
        the air conditioning of courtrooms and judges' quarters was be­
        lieved to be most urgent. This list was attached to the report of
        the Committee. The Committee was instrumental in securing
         the inclusion of an appropriation of $1,150,000 in a supplemental
        appropriation act for the current fiscal year which will permit the
                                 22 

courtrooms and judges' quarters on that list to be air conditioned,
and this work is presently going forward.
   Other court quarters which the Committee considers should be
air conditioned as rapidly as possible were listed in a second sched­
ule attached to the report of the Committee. In order to go for­
ward with the air conditioning of court quarters during the next
fiscal year the Committee recommended that there be included in
the budget for the courts for the fiscal year 1957 an item of
$1,500,000 to cover the cost of air conditioning, and that the Com­
mittee on air conditioning be continued with power to advise the
Administrative Office as to the expenditure of said sum in the air
conditioning of courtrooms, court quarters and jury rooms, and
with full power to make such changes in this list as may seem
proper. The Conference approved the report of the Committee
and adopted the foregoing recommendation.
INCREASE OF PER DIEM AND MILEAGE ALLOWANCES OF COURT
                            PERSONNEL

   The Director reported action taken by him under Public Law
189 of the 84th Congress approved July 28, 1955, which increased
from $9 to $12 a day the per diem allowance in lieu of subsistence
which might be authorized for supporting personnel of the courts
while engaged in official travel within the continental United
States and from 7 cents to 10 cents the mileage rate for the use
of privately owned automobiles in official travel by both judges
and supporting personnel of the courts. He stated that subject
to action which might be taken by the Conference he had in­
creased the per diem and mileage allowances to the sum permitted
by the recent act as above spedfied because he considered that
they were necessary for just reimbursement of the personnel of
the courts for the travel expenses involved. He further reported
that the addition to the cost of official travel of the courts could
not be defrayed without serious impairment of the service except by
a supplemental appropriation. The Conference approved the ac­
tion of the Director and authorized him to seek a supplemental
appropriation to cover the increased cost.
                          ApPROPRIATIONS

  The Director submitted to the Conference for its approval pur­
suant to the statute (28 U. S. C. 605) estimates for supplemental
                                        23 

       appropriations for the current fiscal year, and for annual appro­
       priations for the fiscal year 1957.
         The supplemental estimates included funds for increased sal­
       ary costs resulting from the enactment of the Federal Employees
       Salary Increase Act of 1955, increased travel costs due to the in­
       crease in the rates of allowance for subsistence and the use of pri­
       vately owned automobiles in official travel under the recent Public
       Law 189 of the present Congress, increases authorized by the Con­
       ference in the salaries of court reporters and added costs of sal­
       aries of referees in bankruptcy as authorized by the Conference.
       The estimates were approved as submitted.
         The estimates for the annual appropriations for the operation of
       the courts during the fiscal year 1957 were approved as submitted
       with additions for the cost of air conditioning, increases in salaries
       of referees in bankruptcy and court reporters authorized by the
       Conference as above shown, and with authorization for the Direc­
       tor to add not to exceed $75,000 for salaries of additional person­
       nel for the Administrative Office, with a commensurate sum for
       impersonal facilities and not to exceed $14,000 for the annual cost
       of reclassifications in that office.

                                 HABEAS CORPUS

          Chief Judge Parker, Chairman of the Committee on Habeas Cor­
       pus, informed the Conference that the proposed legislation ap­
       proved by the the Conference at the March, 1955 session (CL Rpt.
       p. 18) had been introduced in the House of Representatives as
       H. R. 5649 entitled "A Bill to amend section 2254 of Title 28 of
       the United States Code in reference to applications for writs of
       habeas corpus by persons in custody pursuant to the judgment of
       a State court." A hearing was held before a Subcommittee of the
       Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives in June
       1955, after which the bill was favorably reported to the House by
       the Committee. It was pending on the House Calendar at the ad­
       journment of the first session of the present Congress.
          The Conference reaffirmed its support of this proposed legisla­
       tion and recommended its enactment by Congress at its next
       seSSIOn.
       ANNUITIES FOR WIDOWS AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN OF JUDGES

1. 	    The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation made at the
       March 1955 session (Cf. Rpt. p. 15) that legislation be enacted to
                                  24

authorize provision for payment of annuities on a contributory            ~
basis to widows and dependent children of judges comparable to            ..l.J
the provisions made under existing law for annuities to widows and
dependent children of Members of Congress.
                 OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM

   Judge Watkins, chairman, submitted the report of the Commit­
tee on the Operation of the Jury System.
   The proposed legislation to provide for a jury commission for
each United States district court, to regulate its compensation, to
prescribe its duties, and for other purposes which has been advo­
cated by the Conference for more than 10 years was again intro­
duced in the first session of the 84th Congress as H. R. 6250 and
S. 1775. Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference reaffirmed its support of this measure.
   The Committee procured the reintroduction in the 84th Con­
gress of bills to carry out the recommendations of the Conference
to establish uniform qualifications for jurors in the Federal courts
by repealing that paragraph of Section 1861, United States Code,
Title 28, which states that no person is competent for jury service
if he is incompetent to serve as a grand or petit juror by the law
of the state in which the district court is held (S. 1774, H. R. 6252).
The Conference reaffirmed its approval of this proposed legisla­
tion and authorized the Committee to continue its efforts to secure
its enactment.
   The attention of the Conference was called to bills (H. R. 423,
S. 2699) which would require that no citizen be excluded from
grand or petit jury service because of sex; but would permit any
woman to elect to make the provision inapplicable to herself. It
was the view of the Conference that no man or woman should
be excused from jury service on account of sex upon mere request
and that provision for the use of women jurors in all districts
should be made pursuant to the terms of the bills recommended
by the Conference (S. 1774, H. R. 6252).
   Inasmuch as proposed legislation to authorize in certain cases
the appointment of special counsel and investigators to assist
grand juries in the exercise of their powers, heretofore disapproved
by the Conference eCf. Rpt. Sept. sess. 1952, p. 16; Sept. 1953
sess. p. 21), has been reintroduced in the present Congress as H. R.
777, the Conference upon recommendation of the Committee re­
                                      25 

     affirmed its position that this proposed legislation ought not to
     be enacted.
        The Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of pending bills (H. R.
     4732, H. R. 4777 and S. 1825) to provide for jury trial as of right
     of the issue of just compensation in condemnation cases notwith­
     standing the discretionary power given to the court by Rule 71A
     (h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to provide for de­
     termination of the issue of compensation by a commission. After
     the appointment of a committee and careful consideration of this
     matter, the Conference has several times gone on record against
     the enactment of legislation of this character (Cf. Rpt. Mar. 1952
     sess. pp. 7-8; Sept. 1952 sess. p. 15; Apr. 1954 sess. p. 15; Mar.
     1955 sess. p. 21). It is the view of the Conference that the pres­
     ent procedure in condemnation proceedings as prescribed by Rule
     71A (h) is operating fairly and efficiently and should be per­
     mitted to continue.
        The Committee was authorized at its request to study a pend­
     ing bill (R. R. 565) which would require that in a civil action
     tried by a jury, other than those tried by a jury "as a matter of
     right guaranteed by the seventh amendment to the Constitution,"
.- the number of jurors that must constitute the jury and the num­
'WI" ber of jurors who must agree in order that there be a valid verdict
     or finding shall be determined by the law of the state in which
     the action is tried; or, if there is no state law on the subject, that
     trial shall be by 12 jurors and the verdict or finding shall be valid
     if 10 of them agree.
        The Conference received the report of the Committee that the
     revised edition of the handbook for petit jurors, prepared by the
     Committee, has been printed and will be furnished to all judges
     with the information that supplies of the handbook are available
     for use in their respective courts upon requisition to the Admin­
     istrative Office.
        A further report by the Administrative Office of its study of
     the costs of operation of the jury system was received and au­
     thorized to be distributed among the judges.
                           JUDICIAL STATISTICS

      Judge Clark presented the report of the Committee on Judicial
    Statistics of which he is the chairman. During the spring at the
    request of the committee, 28 district judges kept diaries for a
                                26 

period of 3 months noting the amount of time spent in court and
chambers in individual cases. The Administrative Office is pre­        .1) 

paring a report of the results, which substantiates the information
obtained from previous studies, particularly as to the relatively
large amount of time required by the private cases. Judge Clark
expressed the appreciation of the committee to the judges who
had participated in the study.
   The Committee in its report discussed the factors to be consid­
ered in recommending the creation of additional judgeships and
came to the conclusion that a single mathematical standard could
not be established because of the individual factors in each case.
It suggested that the Administrative Office be notified by the
chief judge of the circuit, when possible at least 3 weeks before
the meeting of the Judicial Conference, of any recommendations
for additional judgeships which he intends to make and that the
Administrative Office then mail statistical data and other infor­
mation with reference to the proposed judgeship to all members
of the Conference before their meeting.
   A further committee recommendation discussed by the chair­
man of the committee and other members of the Conference was
that the Conference go on record as being opposed to the creation
of an additional judgeship in any district where the judicial busi­ ; .
                                                                       a> 

ness is now being despatched satisfactorily and there is no present
indication that this condition will not continue. The report was
received and the Administrative Office was authorized to circulate
it among the circuit and district judges.
                      PRE-TRIAL PROCEDURE

  Judge Murrah, Chairman of the Committee on Pre-trial Pro­
cedure, submitted its report to the Conference. He stated that
information from the circuits indicated that progress was being
made in expanding the use of pre-trial and improving the tech­
niques employed in the district courts. He emphasized the im­
portance of the circuit committees and referred to the work which
was being done to inform the newly appointed judges of the value
of the pre-trial conference and to help them to adapt it to their
own needs. For the last several years, he said, he has been writ­
ing to each newly appointed district judge suggesting that he in­
vestigate the merits of pre-trial. He has also written at the same     ~.
time to the chief judge of the circuit asking for his cooperation in
                                                27 

         providing an opportunity for an experienced pre-trial judge to
".,      discuss pre-trial with the new appointee.
            The following resolution of the Committee, having been circu­
         lated among the district judges, was adopted by the Conference:
               "It is recommended that the Judicial Conference approve the appointment
            by the Chief Justice of the United States of a panel of district judges
            consisting of one or more from each circuit who shall make a study of the
            special problems in the pre-trial of long and complicated cases, the study to
            be under the auspices of the Pre-trial Committee and in conference with
            leading trial counsel: that this panel be authorized to meet in conference;
            and that after the formation and study of such panel, it be adopted as the
            policy of the Judicial Conference of the United States that in antitrust and
            similar complicated and protracted cases one of the judges of this panel be
            available to the judge who will try the case, on his request and upon designa­
            tion by the chief judge of the circuit, for consultation or to sit jointly in the
            pre-trial conferences, or to assist in such manner and to such extent as the
            trial judge may deem advisable."
           Judge Murrah stated that the resolution had been approved by
         38 of the 42 district judges writing to him concerning it, a few
         not expressing an opinion because they felt it a matter with which
         they were not directly concerned. The Committee re-emphasized
         that the request for assistance to the panel or a member thereof
......   would always be entirely voluntary on the part of the judge by
-.I      whom a long case was to be tried and the assistance given would
         then only be to the extent requested.
           The Administrative Office was authorized to circulate the Com­
         mittee report among the judiciary.

                      COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS

            Judge Maris, chairman, submitted the report of the Committee
         on Revision of the Laws.
            A bill (H. R. 29) pending in the present Congress provides for
         the appointment of hearing examiners serving the administrative
         agencies by five commissioners constituting the Office of Admin­
         istrative Procedure. The examiners would be known as admin­
         istrative judges. Although the Committee was of the opinion
         that the general policy involved in the bill is not one upon which
         the Judicial Conference should express an opinion, it considered
         that two provisions of it which bear directly upon the judiciary
         should be disapproved by the Conference. The first provision is
         that removal of an administrative judge for neglect of duty, or
         physical or mental disability may be accomplished only upon final
         order of the United States district court for the district in which
                                28 


the administrative judge is stationed in a civil action for removal     AIIII\
instituted by the Director of the Office of Administrative Proce-       ..J)
dure. The Committee felt that it would be unwise and perhaps
unconstitutional to impose upon district courts the duty of re­
moving officers of the executive branch of the Government. The
bill also would provide that the President is to appoint a circuit
judge as 1 of the 5 commissioners who comprise the Office of
Administrative Procedure. This would make such a judge an offi­
cial in the executive branch of the Government which would be
inconsistent with his judicial office and would seriously interfere
and disqualify him for the performance of his judicial duties. The
Conference adopted the recommendation of the Committee and
disapproved the proposed legislation.
   The following resolutions adopted by the Judicial Conference of
the District of Columbia Circuit were brought to the attention of
the Conference and referred to the Committee on Revision of the
Laws:
      "REsOLVED by the Judicial Conference of the District of
    Columbia Circuit that it disapproves the legislation embodied
    in S. 448, 84th Congress, a bill to confer jurisdiction on the
    United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or       ~
    any judge thereof, to issue writs of habeas corpus with respect
    to persons held in the reformatory at Lorton or the workhouse
    at Occoquan, both in the State of Virginia, for criminal offenses
    committed in the District of Columbia.
       "RESOLVED by the Judicial Conference of the District of
    Columbia Circuit that it disapproves the legislation embodied
    in H. R. 151, 84th Congress, a bill relating to the practice of
    law in the District of Columbia.
       "RESOLVED by the Judicial Conference of the District of
    Columbia Circuit that it disapproves the legislation embodied
    in H. R. 828, 84th Congress, a bill 'to amend Title 28 of the
    United States Code with respect to the eligibility of members
    of the bar of the United States Supreme Court to practice
    before all courts of appeals and district courts of the United
    States,' in so far as the provisions thereof would apply to
    practice before the United States Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia Circuit or before the United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia."                         .~
     SALARY AND TERM OF THE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT
                               CoURT OF GUAM

       Judge Maris brought to the attention of the Conference the fact
    that the judge of the District Court of Guam did not receive the
    increase in salary accorded to district judges and judges in the
    Territories by the Act of March 2, 1955, and that his present salary
    of $13,125 per year is $1,875 less than the salary of the United States
    attorney in Guam as a result of recent increase in the salaries of
    United States attorneys. Judge Maris suggested that the existing
    law be amended so as to provide that the judge of the District Court
    of Guam shall receive compensation at the rate prescribed for
    judges of the United States district courts which would give him a
    salary of $22,500 and also that his term of office be enlarged from
    4 years to 8 years which would make the term the same as that
    prescribed for the judges of the District Courts of Puerto Rico,
    the Canal Zone and the Virgin Islands. The Conference ap­
    proved the suggestion of Judge Maris and voted to recommend to
    Congress the introduction and enactment of a draft of bill prepared
-   by him which would carry these provisions into effect.
                    COMMITTEE ON CIVIL DISABILITIES

       At the March 1955 session, the Conference directed that the
    draft of a bill prepared by the Committee on Civil Disabilities,
    which would amend the probation law so as to permit confinement
    in jail-type institutions or treatment institutions for a period not
    exceeding 6 months in a grant of probation on a I-count indictment,
    be circulated among the judges for an expression of views (Cf. Rpt.
    p.24). Chief Judge Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on Civil
    Disabilities, informed the Conference that the report had been cir­
    culated as directed and that a large majority of the judges who had
    replied favored the proposed legislation. The Conference voted
    to recommend to Congress the enactment of such a law.
                           INDIGENT LITIGANTS

      The Director informed the Conference that a hearing had been
    held before a Subcommittee of the JUdiciary Committee of the
    House of Representatives on a number of bills providing for the
    payment of compensation to counsel appointed to represent poor
    persons accused of crime, including the bill recommended by the
                                 30 

Judicial Conference. A number of questions had been raised with        -4
regard to details of the bill recommended by the Conference and the    ..,
Director was of the opinion that it is likely that amendments to it
will be proposed. He desired the direction of the Conference as to
what position he should take if his view is requested with regard to
any proposed amendments to the bill. The matter was referred to
the Committee on Court Administration for its advice.
PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS OF ApPEALS OF THE
                  EIGHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS

  At the request of Circuit Judge Sanborn, the Conference, pur­
suant to Title 28, U. S. C. 48, consented that terms of the Court of
Appeals of the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be
pretermitted during the current fiscal year.
  At the request of Chief Judge Phillips, the Conference consented
that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit at Okla­
homa City, Oklahoma, and Wichita, Kansas, be pretermitted
during the current fiscal year.
AMENDMENTS TO RULES ADOPTED BY COURTS OF ApPEALS FOR RE­
 VIEW OR ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES              0

   The Courts of Appeals for the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and
Tenth Circuits submitted to the Conference for approval pursuant
to the provisions of the Act of December 29, 1950 (64 Stat. 1129; 5
U. S. C. 1041) amendments to rules adopted by those Courts re­
lating to the review and enforcement of orders of administrative
agencies. The amendments were approved. The rules involved
are as follows: Second Circuit, Rule 13 paragraph g; Fourth Cir­
cuit, Rule 27 paragraph 7; Fifth Circuit, Rule 38; Ninth Circuit,
Rule 34 paragraph 7; and Tenth Circuit, Rule 34 paragraph 7.
                           CoMMI'ITEES

   The Conference resolved that all existing committees of the Con­
ference be discharged, and that the Chief Justice, with the advice
and assistance of the members of the Advisory Committee as

                             APPENDIX
      REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE
               JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES
                  By the HONORABLE WILLIAM P. ROGERS,
                Acting Attorney General of the United States
                             WASHINGTON, D. C., September 19, 1955.
       Mr. Chief Justice, Member8 of the Judicial Conference of the
            United States,
         I appreciate this opportunity to appear on behalf of the Attor­
       ney General and make the annual report to the Judicial Confer­
       ence of the United States. Mr. Brownell requested me to extend
       his apology for his absence, but he made arrangements to be out
       of the country many months ago. I know that he was keenly
_ 	 disappointed when he found he could not attend, for he looks for­
.."I 	 ward to meeting with the Members of this Conference and the
       privilege extended to discuss matters of mutual interest and con­
       cern. This year there are again a' number of matters which may
       be of some interest to the Conference.
                                        I
        Case Backlog and Delay.-The Department of Justice shares
      the concern of the Judicial Conference and is greatly disturbed by
      the continuing accumulation of pending cases and the consequent
      delays in disposing of matters in the Federal courts. The Attorney
      General has directed that in the coming year the greatest possible
      emphasis be given to eliminating this backlog without sacrificing
      any legitimate interests of the litigants, either the United States or
      any claimant against it.
        As you know, the Department is plaintiff in 25 percent and de­
      fendant in 8 percent of all civil litigation in the district courts­
      which amounts to about 20,000 new cases each year. In addition
      there are about 37,000 criminal cases which the Government prose­
      cutes annually. Excluding the Customs Court and the Court of
--	   Claims, this means that the United States is a party in approxi­
                                       (33)
                                   34 

mately 60 percent of all the cases in the Federal District Courts.
   Therefore, as representatives of the United States we in the De­
partment of Justice have deep concern about the delay in getting
a case disposed of in certain districts, and we have a great responsi­
bility to do everything in our power during this next year to help
correct a condition which has become almost chronic and which, I
earnestly believe unless corrected, may become a disgrace to our
Nation.
   During the last week we had the pleasure of having a Justice
of the Court of Appeals of the United Kingdom at lunch. After
lunch he spoke many words of praise for the United States gen­
erally, but he indicated that he was surprised, to say the least, at
the delay in our judicial processes. He mentioned, as an example,
that it takes an average of 4 years to try a case in the Southern
and Eastern Districts of New York. In England, he said, it takes
6 months or less to bring any case to trial and no more than 3
months thereafter to get a decision on appeal. A few years ago,
he pointed out, there was a backlog which had developed in the
English courts so that almost a year was required to try a case.
This delay became a matter of such concern to everyone that by
special effort of all persons involved the condition was speedily
corrected. For some time now in England no more than 6 months
                                                                           o
has been needed to try any case.
   The latest figures prepared by the Administrative Office of the
Courts show the serious nature of the problem which faces us.
   In Massachusetts from the time a civil case is filed until it is
tried by a jury on an average takes 22% months.
   In Eastern Pennsylvania it takes almost 34 months on an aver­
age from the time a civil case is filed until it is tried by the court
and 31 months for a jury trial. In Western Pennsylvania it takes
32% months and 32 months, respectively.
   In Eastern Louisiana from the time a civil case is filed until it
is tried by the court on an average takes 23% months. In Eastern
Michigan it takes more than 25 months.
   In the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Ohio from
the time a civil case is filed until it is tried by a jury on an average
takes over 3 years.
   In the Southern District of Ohio from the time a civil case is
filed until a trial by the court ta.kes 27 months on an average. In
Northern Illinois it takes more than 23 months. In Colorado it
is 29.6 months on an average.
                                      35 

        In N e~ York, Eastern District, from the time a civil case is filed
     until it is tried by a jury takes on an average 41.6 months. In
     the Southern District it takes 4 years.
        In the Southern District from the time a civil case is filed until
     it is tried by the court takes on an average 44.7 months. In the
     Eastern District it takes on an average 52.9 months or almost 41h
     years.
        There are, of course, many reasons for this appalling backlog
     of cases. Whatever the reasons, during the next year by working
     long hours and by giving constant attention to the problem, we
     believe that we can reduce our caseload by one-fourth. If this is
     possible it will mean a reduction in the Courts' total backlog of
     approximately 15 percent. Such an accomplishment, of course,
     would be a significant step in the right direction.
        It has often been said, but it bears repeating: That justice de­
     layed in many cases is justice denied. Resentment arising from
     injustice may inflict wounds more lasting and more painful than
     physical injury. While neither the courts nor the Department of
     Justice can control the influx of new business resulting from new

-
   rights accorded against the Government, we can and must take
     every possible step to insure prompt consideration and termina­
     tion of all claims.
        Of course the Judicial Conference for sometime has been work­
     ing on this difficult problem. At the special session in March,
     the conference expressed its "serious concern over the inability
     of the courts in many districts as presently constituted, particu­
     larly in metropolitan areas, to keep up with the rising tide of judi­
     cial business and consequent accumulation of arrear ages and lon.g
     delays to litigants in reaching trial." We view it a most promis­
     ing development that a Committee of this Conference has been ap­
     pointed to undertake a comprehensive study into the overall ad­
     ministration of the courts. The Department stands ready to
     assist this Committee in every possible way.
        I would not want to speculate into the deficiencies which this
     Committee may find or the recommendations which it will make.
     However, it is obvious that in varying degrees both the courts
     and the litigants are responsible for the backlog and delays. Our
     interest should not be in fixing responsibility-rather our concern
     should be to help in every way possible to correct the condition.
     It may be of interest, therefore, briefly to mention some of the
     corrective actions which have been and are being taken by the
                                  36 

  Department looking to the more efficient and expeditious handling
  of our cases.
     One of the facts which first came to our attention was the almost
  complete lack of liaison between the Department and the 94 United
  States Attorneys. For example, there was little information and
  almost no supervision in the Department with respect to most of
  the cases being handled in the field. From our records, it was
 impossible to determine how long cases had been pending or what
 and how much they involved. Salaries were so far out of line that
 many United States Attorneys :lnd their assistants, with Depart­
 mental approval, were implementing their income through outside
 practice. The unfortunate result was that in many cases the Gov­
 ernment's business became of secondary importance. In 13 years
 after 1940, the backlog of cases in the Department had risen from
 approximately 18,000 cases to about 34,000.
    Our immediate objective was to reduce and ultimately eliminate
 this backlog. The ground work was completed by forbidding out­
 side practice, by obtaining salaries sufficient to attract and keep
 competent lawyers, by enlarging the staffs in critical areas within
 the limits of available appropriations, and by the creation of the
 Executive Office of United States Attorneys to supervise, direct
 and maintain constant contact with our field offices. Last Sep­
 tember, this Office was charged with the responsibility not only to
                                                                         o
prevent any further increase in the backlog, but to produce a
marked decrease by the end of the fiscal year. This was a com­
mitment the Department made to Congress in connection with
obtaining additional personnel and salary increases.
    Reduction of the existing case backlog was made a principal
theme of the United States Attorneys' Conference held in Wash­
ington in October, 1954. Seminars were conducted at which the
top officials of the Department thrashed out and resolved many
problems concerning the handling of delinquent cases as well as
how current matters could be more expeditiously processed.
    The Litigation Control System, which was established in July,
1953, was enlarged and the reporting procedures improved to bring
within its scope and up to date practically all litigation, actual
and potential, pending in United States Attorneys' offices. Serv­
ing as a central control, this system provides the United States
Attorney with up-to-date information on all matters in his office
so that he can effectively supervise, control and take prompt and
vigorous action in connection with all matters, old and new. Pe­
                                    37 

    riodic visits to field offices by attorneys and administrative per~
    sonnel assure that the system is being given effective and practical
    application on a day-to-day working basis.
        Additional authority has been delegated to United States Attor~
    neys to enable them to take final action in thousands of cases and
    matters without prior approval in Washington. By eliminating
    much correspondence and redtape there has been a more rapid
    termination of pending cases.
        By these and other measures, our total backlog has been reduced
    from 34,521 cases pending in September of 1954 to 29,979 as of
    June 30, 1955, a reduction of 4,542 cases in 8 months. It is en~
    couraging that we have been able to stop the upward trend of
    our backlog and, in fact, have been able to reduce it substantially.
    However, we are not satisfied with the rate of reduction. As I
    stated earlier, it is our goal to increase the rate which amounted
    to about 12 per cent in fiscal 1954 to 25 per cent in fiscal 1955.
        Early in October we will have a 3-day conference of all United
    States Attorneys in Washington. At that time the Department
    intends to plan a detailed nation-wide program to reduce our back­
     log. This program will include regional meetings of United States
     Attorneys, plans to recruit as many additional assistants in a dis­
     trict as necessary for a concentrated effort, periodic visits by top
    officials in the Department into the districts where the conditions
     are most critical to confer with the courts and the United States
     Attorneys in the hope of finding improved methods to expedite
     our work.
        Finally, we will stand ready to give the courts complete coopera­
     tion in this most important endeavor. Because of increased ap­
     propriations we will be able to supply as much help as needed in
     a district as long as it can be fully utilized. We also will hold
     ourselves in readiness to work extra long hours, beginning early
      and working late. If the backlog condition has not greatly im­
     proved by next summer, we will be prepared to try cases through­
     out the summer months. Congress in recognition of this backlog
     problem increased our appropriation in order that we might employ
     additional assistants. We hope to keep faith with Congress by sig­
      nificant accomplishments during the next year.
        Despite the nation-wide trend, due to an influx of new business,
     pending civil cases in some districts, particularly in the Eastern

-    and Southern Districts of New York, increased sharply during the
      last year. Taken together with other evidence, the enactment of
                                 38 

legislation to provide additional judgeships is clearly justified.
Thus while Mr. Chandler reports that the average individual case
output per judge has increased by over 20 percent since 1940, the
March session of this Conference reports that "while the number
of judgeships in the district courts has increased by 27 percent
since 1941, during the same period there has been an increase of
55 percent in the number of all civil cases commenced annually,
with an 80-percent increase in the number of new private civil
cases which take much the largest part of the judges' time." In
a letter to Chairman Kilgore of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
the Department concurred in the recommendation of the Judicial
Conference to provide a critically needed circuit judgeship for the
Second Circuit and 19 additional district court judgeships, 3 of
which would be for the Southern District of New York. We
hope that Congress will act favorably on this important recommen­
dation of the Judicial Conference.
   It is encouraging that Congress in considering the needs of the
Courts has recently appropriated funds which will remove restric­
tions on travel and the purchase of needed books and stenographic
equipment. It is also encouraging that the Supplemental Appro­
priation Act for 1956 contained $1,150,000 for the purpose of pro­
viding air conditioning for Courts in critical areas. In some dis­
                                                                         o
tricts the whole judicial process is brought to a halt in the summer
months, not because the judges and United States Attorneys are
unwilling to discharge their responsibilities, but because it is phys­
ically impossible to conduct proceeds or expect parties and wit­
nelSses to appear in a stifling "100 degree-plus" courtroom. As
this situation is rectified the work output will undoubtedly increase
in these districts.
                                   II
   Diversity Jurisdiction.-There are other ways for attacking the
backlog problem. Even a cursory examination will disclose that
the Federal courts are now burdened with a substantial amount of
litigation which could best be handled by State or local courts.
   Throughout our history the right to sue in or remove to Federal
courts, except as otherwise provided by special statutes, has al­
ways been limited by a requirement that the case involve a mini­
mum jurisdictional amount. In determining what that amount
should be, a Committee of the Judicial Conference concluded in
1951, in accordance with historic precedents, that "the jurisdic­
                                      39 

    tional amount should not be so high as to convert the Federal
    courts into the courts of big business or so low as to fritter away
    their time in the trial of petty offenses." We agree.
       In 1789, the First Judiciary Act set the amount at $500. The
    next significant change was in 1888 when it was raised to $2,000.
    The present amount, $3,000, was adopted in 1911. The value of
    the dollar has depreciated since 1911. This fact need not be elab­
    orated here. It was one of the most potent and persuasive argu­
    ments for the enactment of Public Law 9, 84th Congress, which
    contained the much justified judicial pay increase. It certainly
    makes no sense to apply the 1911-$3,000 test as a yardstick for
    substantiality today. Yet the reasons for imposing a realistic mini­
    mum jurisdictional amount in diversity cases are now far more
    demanding.
       The Department of Justice favors the enactment of legislation to
    reduce, through the reimposition of a reasonable jurisdictional
    amount, the volume of non-Federal business in Federal courts.
    This can be done without impairing any legitimate right of access
    to these courts. An increase in the amount for diversity jurisdic­
    tion to $10,000, as recommended by the Judicial Conference,
    would seem appropriate. Statistics compiled in 1951 indicate that
    such an increase might eliminate 39 percent of all diversity con­
    tract cases and 13 percent of the personal injury cases.
       The argument has been advanced that the higher jurisdictional
     amount could readily be met in tort cases by merely inflating the
    claim for damages. Perhaps the N ew York Civil Practice Act
    suggests a workable deterrent to this practice. The law might pro­
     vide that a plaintiff who elects to sue in the Federal courts and
     recovers less than the minimum jurisdictional amount could be
     denied costs (see N. Y. C. P. A. Section 1474). Adoption of some
     such appropriate penalty could materially reduce the filing of suits
     in the Federal courts which do not belong there in the first instance.
                                     III
      Habeas Corpus.-Another proposal in which the Department
    has considerable interest and which would have a direct impact
    on the backlog problem relates to the increasing use or, more accu­
    rately, the increasing abuse of the writ of habeas corpus. As Mr.
    Justice Frankfurter said in his dissent in Bernal v. Large (332 U. S.

-   174, 195): "I think it fair to say that the scope of habeas corpus
    in the federal courts is an untidy area of the law ..."
                                 40
   In 1953, the Judicial Conference reactivated its Committee on
Habeas Corpus to study the problem of District Court review of
State court convictions by habeas corpus. Last March, with the
approval of this Conference, the Conference of State Chief Jus­
tices, the National Association of State Attorneys General, and the
American Bar Association, H. R. 5649 was introduced and referred
to the Committee on the Judiciary. In June, the Department
added its approval, stating that it was "pleased to add its support
to the legi~lation for, as drafted, it would appear to constitute an
excellent approach to a difficult problem." The bill was favor­
ably reported by the House Judiciary Committee on July 18,1955.
   The proposal is not designed to dilute substantive rights guaran­
teed by the writ which Macaulay, the eminent English historian,
described as "the most stringent curb that ever legislation imposed
on tyranny." Rather, it is intended to strike at the many misuses
to which the writ has recently been put. For example, in United
States v. Hayman (342 U. S. 205), the Supreme Court observed
that during a 3-year period an average of 845 writs were filed with
only an average of 26 releases per year and that in some districts,
up to 40 percent of all applications were so-called repeater peti­
tions. According to more recent figures of the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts, in the four-year period from        o
1950 through 1953, only 29 petitions to review State court decisions
were granted and in only 4 did petitioners secure their release from
State courts. Over one-third of all recent petitions seek the re­
view of State court decisions. There is every reason to believe
that a large number of these petitions were filed solely for the pur­
poses of delay, to obtain "joy rides," as out of time attempts for
new trial or for other frivolous and unjustifiable reasons. The
effect has been to burden the Federal courts with far too many
meaningless and repetitious writs and to prolong, contrary to the
public interest, the final determination of criminal cases.
                                 IV
  Deportation Proceedings.-Deportation proceedings are another
"untidy" area of the law which is ripe for legislative clarification
and amendment. For some time a departmental committee has
been studying this problem. While no final conclusions have yet
been reached, some of the problems under consideration may be ...........
of interest.
                                     41 

       Historically, an order for the deportation of an alien could be
    challenged only by habeas corpus by an alien in custody. How­
    ever, in Shaughnessyv. Pedreiro (349 U. S. 48), the Supreme Court
    held that under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, an
    alien not in custody can obtain judicial review of a deportation
    order in an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief
    under Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act.
       The Immigration Service has under consideration a number of
    new procedures to assure aliens in deportation proceedings a fair
    and prompt hearing in accordance with the statutes. It also now
    adheres implicitly to a policy of detaining only those aliens facing
    deportation (or exclusion) who have attempted to abscond, who
    have absconded, or whose enlargement would be contrary to the
    public safety or the interests of national security. Under this
    policy, a 75-percent reduction in detentions has been effectuated
    and of those detained, 98 percent are Mexicans ordinarily held less
    than 24 hours.
       While aliens in custody can obtain prompt review of deportation
    proceedings by habeas corpus, the great majority who are not de­

-   tained can now obtain review only in a time-consuming and pro­
    cedurally inappropriate action for declaratory judgment. Legis­
    lation to provide orderly judicial review is needed to deal effec­
    tively and fairly with this group. It should cover such important
    incidents as the need for expedition, orderly venue and the pre­
    clusion of repetitious court proceedings. It should impose a rea­
    sonable time within which judicial review could be sought after
    administrative remedies available as of right are exhausted.
       The law should contain reasonable restrictions to prevent the
    filing of frivolous or repetitious petitions for habea8 corpU8 and
    also provisions to prevent their withdrawal for ulterior purposes.
     This last would curtail one serious abuse of the writ whereby some
     deportable aliens, at the last minute and after all transportation ar­
    rangements have been made, file a petition, thus halting the planned
     departure. However, as soon as the ship or plane has departed
     they withdraw the petition, in this way prolonging their stay until
     new transportation arrangements are made. At that time the
     merry-go-round could and in some instances has started allover
     again.
        The above and related problems are under study, We expect

-    to present to Congress next year a comprehensive legislative pro­
     posal to improve this situation. We hope it will meet with your
     a,pproval and command your support.

                                  V
   Federal Youth Corrections Act.-We are particularly pleased
with the steadily increasing use that is being made by the courts of
the provisions of the Youth Corrections Act. Judges in 41 of the
53 districts authorized to invoke the Act have made use of its
various provisions-1O courts for the first time during this past
year.
   As might be expected, the great majority of committed youth
offenders, slightly more than 70 percent, were convicted of violating
the National Motor Vehicle Act. Another 10 percent were involved
in forging Government checks.
   Since facilities to implement the Act were certified by Mr. Ben­
nett, Director of the Bureau of Prisons, in January 1954, some 469
youths under the age of 22 have been committed under its pro­
visions for treatment and training. An additional 46 youths were
received for 60-day study and observation with a report and a
recommendation being made to the court upon completion of the
study period.
   No effort has been spared in securing the best possible staff for
the institution at Ashland, Kentucky. From the Warden on down
each position has been filled with the best qualified person available    o
to us. In the treatment and training program, we have obtained
the services of a number of specialists; these include a Psychiatrist,
a Clinical Psychologist, a Senior Medical Officer, 4 Social Workers,
5 Vocational Training Specialists, 2 Chaplains, 5 Academic School
Instructors, and a Recreation Supervisor.
   To September 1, 1955, the Youth Division of the United States
Board of Parole had authorized the release of 90 offenders. The
time these youths had been undergoing institutional treatment
ranged from 3 months to almost 2 years. The Youth Division
regularly reviews each case on its individual merits. Where release
is recommended, a system for the orderly follow-up of each parolee
has been initiated. The United States Probation Officers have
been most helpful in their counseling and supervision of these
released youth offenders. To date it has been necessary to return
only 5 youths for further institutional treatment.
   While it is still too early to evaluate the overall effectiveness of
 the Youth Corrections Act as a means of rehabilitating youthful
offenders the results so far are most encouraging.

                 Annuities for Widows and Dependent Children 0/ Judges.-In
               his report last year, the Attorney General called attention to the
               fact that under existing law, only the widows of Supreme Court
               Justices are entitled to pensions and the Department would favor
               a sound program to provide annuities for widows and dependent
               children of all judges. The March session of this Conference rec­
               ommended the enactment of legislation to provide annuities on a
               contributory basis comparable to that already in existence for the
               widows and dependent children of Members of Congress. Several
               such bills were introduced but not acted on in the last session of
               Congress.
                  The Department is in accord with the underlying methods and
               objectives of these proposals to provide protection for the de­
               pendents of members of the judiciary. We are pleased to add our
               support to these plans and will seek prompt and early Congres­
               sional consideration of them.
                                                VII
                  Public Defenders.-The Department is disappointed that the
'OIf!IIIII 	   last session of Congress failed to take action on legislation to provide
               counsel for indigent defendants in Federal courts. The testimony
               and statements presented to the subcommittee of the House Judici­
               ary Committee last spring by leading members of the bench and
               bar overwhelmingly justify the enactment of legislation such as
               H. R. 3881 which the Department and this Conference have en­
               dorsed. We must continue to press so that those hearings will
               bear fruit in the coming year.
                  The Department of Justice and the courts have the responsibility
               of enforcing the law equally, resolutely, and with due regard to the
               rights accorded our people by the Constitution. Over the years,
               the able studies of this Conference have exposed many causes of
               injustice. Equally its recommendations have resulted in much re­
               medial legislation and other corrective action. We appreciate the
               privilege of being permitted to participate in your deliberations,
               and to help arrive at suggestions for improving the administration
               of justice. I am confident that in the future, as in the past, mu­
               tually satisfactory solutions will be forthcoming to insure that jus­
               tice according to law is done in all cases.
