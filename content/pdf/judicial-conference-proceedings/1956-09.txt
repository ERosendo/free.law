         REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 The Attorney General presented a report to the Conference
which appears in the appendix.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE                               a
     OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS                                    .,
   Pursuant to the statute (28 U. S. C. 604 (a) (3)) the Director
had previously submitted to the members of the Conference his
seventeenth annual report on the activities of his office for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1956, including a report of the Chief of the
Division of Procedural Studies and Statistics on the state of the
business of the courts. The Conference approved the immediate
release of the report for publication and authorized the Director
to revise and supplement it in the final printed edition to be issued
later.
                 BUSINESS OF THE COURTS
   State of the dockets of the Federal courts-courts of appeals.­
The number of cases filed in the courts of appeals in the fiscal year
1956 was slightly less than the humber filed during the previous
fiscal year. The cases terminated increased and exceeded the cases
commenced by 146. The general trend in the volume of cases
begun in these courts has been upward since 1947 which probably
is the result of an increase of 49 district judgeships since that
year and a very substantial increase in the number of trials in
                                                                           0
                                     3

    the district courts. The slight decrease in appeals in 1956 is not
o   enough to indicate a change in trend.
       Cases begun were 3,588 and the number terminated, 3,734, leav­
    ing 2,029 pending at the end of the year. The number of termi­
    nations was the largest in at least 17 years and amounted to 44
    cases heard or submitted per judgeship.
       The median period from docketing to disposition of cases heard
    or submitted was 7.4 months, about the same as last year. There
    was a wide variation among the different circuits in their prompt­
    ness in disposing of cases, varying from a median of 3.5 months
    from filing to disposition in the Fourth Circuit to 13.5 months in
    the Ninth Circuit. The latter court has reduced its pending cases
    during the past 2 years from 584 to 348 but at the end of the last
    fiscal year reported a number of cases under submission more than
    3 months.
       District courts.-Civil cases terminated in the district courts in­
    creased more than 8,700 over the previous year and the backlog
    was reduced by 5,300 cases, the only substantial reduction ex­
    cept for the year 1948 in 16 years. Cases commenced increased
    about 3,000 over 1955, a continuation of a long time upward trend.
o   The improved condition was the result of the work of judges in
    many districts but was most apparent in some of the congested
    metropolitan areas and particularly in the Southern District of
    New York. The remarkable achievement of that court in reduc­
    ing its pending civil docket by over 2,000 cases and its calendar
    from 5,630 cases to 1,800 during the year is set forth in detail in
    the report of the Administrative Office. This accomplishment had
    an important part in the excellent showing made by the courts as
    a whole and the methods used there are being studied and effec­
    tively employed in other courts.
       Civil actions filed in all districts in 1956 rose to 62,394 from
    59,375 in 1955, the number terminated was 67,700 and the pending
    caseload went down to 63,526.
       The number of cases between private individuals has continued
    to increase. About two-thirds of the civil cases filed and almost
    three-fourths of the number pending are private cases. Since on
    the average they are occupying much more time of the judges per
    case than actions to which the Government is a party, a constant
    increase in their number is of primary significance. It is mamly
    the result of a continuous rise in cases under the diversity of
    citizenship jurisdiction, including steadily growing motor vehicle
    accident cases, personal injury actions of other types and contract
         407072-56--2
                                 4

actions. As long as the number of motor vehicles on the road            ,
continues to expand, the volume of business continues to grow and
the population to increase, it is reasonable to expect still larger
numbers of these types of cases in the future. This year for the
first time since 1943 more private cases were terminated than
were commenced but the decrease was almost entirely the result
of the excellent record in the Southern District of New York.
    Although 58 out of 94 district courts were able to terminate
more civil cases than were filed during the fiscal year 1956 the
median time for disposition of cases tried continued to increase.
The figure in 1956 was 15.4 months from filing to disposition com­
pared to 14.6 months in 1955. Likewise the median period from
issue to trial increased from 9.1 months to 10.3 months. As
explained in the report of the Administrative Office, where
improvement is occurring the reduction in the median time inter­
vals tends to lag behind the decrease of the pending caseload, so
that in spite of these longer intervals there has been a definite
improvement in the civil dockets of the district courts.
    There was little change in the number of criminal cases filed
except for a drop of some 6,000 in the number of immigration
cases, occurring principally in the five districts on the Mexican
Border. Without including these proceedings, the total criminal             •
cases filed were 25,211. Terminations of all criminal cases                 •
exceeded the number commenced by 1,400 leaving 7,243 pending
on June 30, 1956 of which number a little more than one-fifth
 could not be tried because of fugitive defendants.
    Bankruptcy cases continued to increase but the margin over
 1955 was only some 2,700 cases or 4.5 percent, compared with an
 increase of 11.8 percent in the previous year. The number of
 terminations was also greater but was still about 3,800 short of
 the cases begun bringing the pending caseload to a higher level than
 at any time in recent years. The figures for 1956 were: cases
 filed, 62,086; cases terminated, 58,314 and cases pending at the end
 of the year, 59,364.
    Cases and motions under advisement.-A list of 13 cases and
 motions under advisement more than 6 months on September 1st
 was submitted to the Conference and referred to the chief judges
 of the circuits concerned, for attention of the Judicial Council of
 the circuit where appropriate.

       ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS RECOMMENDED
  In its consideration of the matter of need for additional judge­
ships the Conference had before it a report made by the Com­
                                                                            0

o   mittee on Judicial Statistics to the Committee on Court Adminis­
    tration, at the request of the latter Committee, which set out the
    number and location of additional judgeships which in the Com­
    mittee's judgment, after consideration of statistical data supplied
    by the Administrative Office, would be required to bring the dock­
    ets to a condition where the normal case could be tried within six
    months of filing. The Committee on Court Administration
    informed the Conference that it had considered the report of the
    Committee on Statistics and agreed with it with one modification.
    The Conference also received and carefully considered the views
    of its members individually with regard to conditions in their
    respective circuits.
       The Conference thereupon reaffirmed its recommendations made
    at the September 1955 session with respect to the creation of addi­
    tional judgeships (Conf. Rept. p. 5). It also recommended the
    creation of the following judgeships not heretofore recommended:
      1 additional circuit judgeship for the Fourth Circuit.
      1 additional district judgeship for the District of Massachusetts.
      1 additional district judgeship for the District of Connecticut.
      1 additional district judgeship for the Eastern District of New York.

   The following recommendations with regard to the District of
Alaska, to be effected by an amendment to section 4 of the Organic
Act of the Territory (31 Stat. 322; Title 48 U. S. C. sec. 101) were
adopted:
   1. That the judge assigned to the Second Division be assigned to
the Second and Fourth Divisions with the right to reside in either
Division.
   2. That the district judge who is senior in length of judicial
service in the Territory be the chief judge of the district court with
power to designate and assign temporarily any district judge to
hold sessions in a division other than that to which he has been
assigned by the President.
   3. That the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit be given power to
assign a circuit or district judge of the Ninth Circuit, and the Chief
Justice of the United States to assign any other circuit or district
judge, with the consent of the judge assigned, and of the chief judge
of his circuit, to serve temporarily as a judge of the district court
for the Territory of Alaska whenever it is made to appear that
such an assignment is necessary for the proper dispatch of business.
   The Conference agreed to invite Circuit Judge Chambers of the
Ninth Circuit to attend its next session to give the Conference the
benefit of his views concerning the need of an additional district
judgeship for the District of Arizona.
    A proposal to transfer Kittitas, Klickitat, and Yakima counties
 from the Southern Division of the Eastern District of Washing­
 ton to the Northern Division of the Western District was deferred
 for consideration to a later meeting of the Conference.

  APPOINTMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL JUDGE WHEN
       A DISABLED JUDGE FAILS TO RETIRE
   The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation made at several
previous sessions that the repealed staJ,ute which permitted the
President to appoint an additional judge when a disabled judge
eligible to retire failed to do so and the President found that such
an appointment was necessary for the efficient dispatch of busi­
ness, be amended in the form recommended by the Conference and
reenacted. (Conf. Rept., March 1956 Sess., p. 20, and Reports
there cited). The recommendation of the Conference was em­
bodied in H. R. 4792 of the 84th Congress which passed the House
of Representatives but was not acted upon by the Senate.

  PROPOSED DESIGNATION OF RETIRED JUDGES AS 

               "SENIOR JUDGES"
                                                                                t

   The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation that Sec. 371 (b)
of Title 28, United States Code, be amended so as to designate a
judge taking advantage of the retirement provisions as a "senior
judge" instead of a "retired judge" as at present and to provide
that a roster to be known as the "Roster of Senior Judges" be main­
tained by the Chief Justice of retired judges willing and able to
undertake special judicial duties upon assignment by him when
and as needed (Conf. Rept. March 1956 Sess., p. 20, and Reports
there cited). This proposed legislation was embodied in H. R.
6248 of the 84th Congress, which passed the House of Representa­
tives but was not acted upon by the Senate.
JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORTING
  PERSONNEL AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT
  ADMINISTRATION
  Chief Judge Biggs, who is chairman of the Committee on Sup­
porting Personnel and also chairman of the Committee on Court
Administration, made a joint report for the two Committees. In
meeting together and making a joint report the Committees fol­
lowed the practice initiated last year and continued prior to the
March 1956 session of the Conference (Conf. Repts. Sept. 1955
Sess. p. 9; March 1956 Sess. p. 2).

         RECLASSIFICA.TION OF POSITIONS OF LIBRARIANS

  The recommendation was adopted by the Conference.
            RECLASSIFICATION OF SECRETARIES TO JUDGES

   The Committee on Supporting Personnel reported that it had
considered the resolution of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
Circuit that provision be made for classification of secretaries to
judges in grades GS-ll and GS-12. The Committee pointed out
that this had been considered at length at a previous meeting, a
report having been submitted to the Judicial Conference and
Rpproved by it at the March 1956 session, under which, when
appropriate action is taken by Congress, grades GS-9 and GS-lO
will become available for qualified secretaries as compared with
GS-8 which is the top grade in which they presently may be
classified regardless of their length of experience (Conf. Rept.
March 1956 Sess., pp. 4-7). The Committee on Supporting Per­
                                 10 

sonnel, the Committee on Court Administration concurring, rec­
ommended that the Conference adhere to its previous action, and         t

the recommendation was adopted by the Conference.
RECLASSIFICATION OF POSITIONS IN THE OFFICES OF THE CLERKS OF
                    THE COURTS OF ApPEALS

   At the March 1956 session, the Conference directed the Admin­
istrative Office to examine the grades and salaries of positions in
the offices of the clerks of the courts of appeals and report to the
Committee on Supporting Personnel. This Committee informed
the Conference that it had received the report of the Administra­
tive Office, and, after consideration, with the concurrence of the
Committee on Court Administration) recommended that the posi­
tion descriptions and classifications attached to the report be
adopted as guides to the Administrative Office in classifying these
positions. The Conference adopted the recommendation, with
the understanding that the grades specified are not applicable to
the office of the Clerk of the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, which has been the subject of separate action by the
Committee on Supporting Personnel and the Conference.
RELINQUISHMENT BY CHIEF JUDGES OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE
                                                                        t

                     DUTIES AT AGE SEVENTY

   After receiving the report of the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration at the March 1956 session, the Conference tentatively ap­
proved the following resolution and referred it to the circuit and
district judges for an expression of views pursuant to the "Phil_
lips I'lan" (Jud. Conf. Rept. Sept. 1945 Sess. pp. 9, 10):
        "Resolved, that the Judicial Conference recommend to Con­
     gress the enactment of legislation which will provide that a
     chief judge of a circuit or a chief judge of a district court
     shall cease to be chief judge of his circuit or his court at the
     age of 70 provided however that the Act shall not become
     effective until one year after its passage." (Jud. Conf. Rept.
     March 1956 Sess. p. 10).
   The Conference was informed that seven of the Judicial Con­
ferences of the Circuits approved the proposal and four took no
action.                                                                 A
   After further consideration the Conference reaffirmed its ap­        ,.
proval of the quoted resolution and voted to recommend to Con-
                                         11 


o
   gress for enactment a draft of proposed legislation reported by
     the Committee on Court Administration with the concurrence of
     the Committee on Supporting Personnel as follows:
         A BILL To provide that chief judges of circuits and district courts shall
                  cease to serve as such upon reaching the age of 70.

            Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
         of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
         subsection (a) of section 45 of title 28 of the United States
         Code is amended to read as follows:
              "(a) The circuit judge in regular active service who is
         senior in commission and under 70 years of age shall be the
         chief judge of the circuit. If all the circuit judges in regular
         active service are 70 years of age or older the youngest shall
         act as chief judge until a judge has been appointed and quali­
         fied who is under 70 years of age."
            SEC. 2. Subsection (a) of section 136 of title 28 of the
         United States Code is amended to read as follows:
              "(a) In each district having more than one judge the

o

         of the district court. If all the district judges in regular ac­
         tive service are 70 years of age or older the youngest shall
         act as chief judge until a judge has been appointed and quali­
         fied who is under seventy years of age."
            SEC. 3. The amendments to sections 45 and 136 of title 28
         of the United States Code made by this Act shall take effect
         at the expiration of one year from the date of enactment of
         this Act .

        .M ETHODS OF SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES OF CIRCUITS AND
                                DISTRICT COURTS

        The Committee on Court Administration informed the Con­
     ference that it was not yet prepared to make a report on the sub­
     ject of the various methods proposed for selection of chief judges.
     The Conference granted the Committee further time for consid­
     eration.
                              JUDICIAL VACATIONS

.~     A report of the Committee on Court Administration on the sub­
     ject of vacations of judges was received by the ConfE'rence at the
          407072-56-3
                                  12 

March 1956 session, (Conf. Rept. p. 11) and circulated for an
expression of views under the "Phillips Plan" (Jud. Conf. Rept.
Sept. Sess. 1945, pp. 9, 10). After consideration of the expres­
sions received, and a recommendation of the Committee on Court
Administration that the Conference request the Judicjal Councils
of the respective Circuits to consider the matter of excessive vaca­
tions in their respective Circuits, if any there be, and take appro­
priate action in respect thereto, the Conference adopted the fol­
lowing resolution:
       The Conference declares it to be the policy of the courts
     of the United States that in those circuits or districts in which
     the disposition of judicial business is not upon a current basis,
     judges' vacations should not exceed one month per annum,
     and the Conference requests the Judicial Councils of the
     respective circuits to inquire into the matter of vacations,
     and if any be excessive, to take appropriate action in respect
     thereto.
      DISQUALIFICATION OF A JUDGE FOR BIAS OR PREJUDICE

  Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the two Committees            t
had given consideration to S. 3111 of the 84th Congress, introduced
by Senator Watkins of Utah, relating to the disqualification of a
judge on the ground of bias or prejudice, and that he had been au­
thorized to appoint a subcommittee to give further study to the
subject and report back as soon as possible.
            LAW CLERKS AND SECRETARIES OF JUDGES

   The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation, made at the
March 1956 session (Conf. Rept. p. 5) that 28 U. S. C. sec. 752 be
amended to read as follows:
     "Law clerks and secretaries:
             "District judges may appoint necessary law clerks and
          secretaries."
   As stated in the previous report of the Conference, this recom­
mendation would make the statutory authorizations for law clerks
and secretaries for district judges identical with those now contained
in 28 U. S. C. sec. 712 for circuit judges. It would eliminate the
present requirement for a certificate of necessity by the chief judge    ,
of his circuit for the appointment of a law clerk by a district judge.
                                            13 


o
     Also, it would permit those judges who wished to do so to have the
       services of additional employees at lower grades within the limita­
       tion upon the aggregate salaries of law clerks and secretaries in
       place of one law clerk and one secretary at the maximum grades.
             MEMBERSHIP OF DISTRICT JUDGES IN THE JUDICIAL
                      CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

          A proposal recommended by the Committee on Court Adminis­
       tration with concurrence of the Committee on Supporting Person­
       nel was considered at the March 1956 Session that legislation be
       recommended to provide for membership on the Judicial Confer­
       ence of one district judge from each of the eleven circuits to be
       elected for a term of 3 years by the circuit and district judges of
       the circuits at the annual circuit conferences (Conf. Rept. p. 11).
       The Conference directed that it be circulated among the judges
       for an expression of views pursuant to the "Phillips Plan" (Jud.
       Conf. Rept. Sept. 1945 Sess. pp. 9, 10). The Committee on Court
       Administration reported that the proposal was approved in seven
       circuits and disapproved in one while three circuits took no action.

o
        The Conference approved the proposal that provision be made
       by legislation for membership on the Conference of one District
       Judge from each circuit and recommended the enactment by Con­
       gress of the following bill for that purpose:
            A. 	BILL To amend section 331 of Title 28, United States Code, to provide
              representation of district judges on the Judicial Conference of the
              United States.

              Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
           the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the
           first two paragraphs of section 331 of title 28, United States
           Code, are amended so as to constitute three paragraphs read­
           ing as follows:
              "§ 331. Judicial Conference of the United States.
              "The Chief Justice of the United States shall summon an­
           nually the chief judge of each judicial circuit, the chief judge
           of the Court of Claims, and a district judge from each judicial
           circuit to a conference at such time and place in the United
           States as he may designate. He shall preside at such con­
""".       ference which shall be known as the Judicial Conference of the
.~         United States. Special sessions of the conference may be
           called by the Chief Justice at such times and places as he may
           designate.
                                 14

       "The district judge to be summoned from each judicial cir­
    cuit shall be chosen by the circuit and district judges of the
    circuit at the annual judicial conference of the circuit held
    pursuant to section 332 of this title and shall serve as a mem­
    ber of the conference for three successive years, except that in
    the year following the enactment of this amended section the
    judges in the first, fourth, seventh and tenth circuits shall
    choose a district judge to serve for one year, the judges in the
    second, fifth and eighth circuits shall choose a district judge
    to serve for 2 years and the judges in the third, sixth, ninth and
    District of Columbia circuits shall choose a district judge to
    serve for 3 years.
       "If the chief judge of any circuit or the district judge chosen
    by the judges of the circuit is unable to attend, the Chief
    Justice may summon any other circuit or district judge from
    such circuit. If the chief judge of the Court of Claims is un­
    able to attend the Chief Justice may summon an associate
    judge of such court. Every judge summoned shall attend and,
    unless excused by the Chief Justice, shall remain throughout
    the sessions of the conference and advise as to the needs of his
    circuit or court and as to any matters in respect of which the
    administration of justice in the courts of the United States
    may be improved."
            FEES OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

  The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation of legislation for
an appropriate increase in the fees of United States Commission­
ers. At the March 1956 Session, the Conference, upon the recom­
mendation of the Committee on Supporting Personnel, with a con­
curring advisory vote by the Committee on Court Administration,
recommended an increase in the fee schedule of Commissioners
along lines contained in a report made by the Administrative
Office within a maximum limit of $10,500 per year (Conf. Rept. p.
8). This proposal was embodied in a bill, H. R. 10949 of the 84th
Congress, which passed the House of Representatives but was not
acted upon by the Senate.
                    PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCES

  The Committee on Court Administration, with the Committee              ~
on Supporting Personnel concurring, informed the Conference that
                                  15 

it was of the opinion that the universal use of pre-trial procedure
in civil cases would greatly facilitate the dispatch of the business
of the courts, and it therefore recommended that the Conference
recommend to the Supreme Court an amendment to Rule 16 of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under which the court in every
civil action prior to trial would direct the attorneys for the parties
to appear before it for a pre-trial conference.
   Judge Murrah, chairman of the Committee on Pre-trial Pro­
cedure, told the Conference that his Committee recommended
such an amendment to Rule 16 with an exemption as to a particu­
lar division or court seat only by the affirmative action, through
general or special order, of the Judicial Council of the circuit, deter­
mining that the purpose of holding pre-trial conferences therein
would be defeated by excessive expense or other good cause.
   After consideration, the Conference adopted the following
resolution:
         Resolved, That it is the sense of the Conference that pre­
      trial should be used in every civil case before trial except in
      extraordinary cases where the district judge expressly enters
     an order otherwise.

             DIVERSITY OF CITIZENSHIP JURISDICTION

  Judge Biggs requested and was given leave of the Conference to
withdraw for further consideration and report at a later meeting
of the Conference all recommendations of the Committee on Court
Administration relating to amendment of the diversity of citizen­
ship jurisdiction of the district courts, restriction of jurisdiction in
State Workmen's Compensation Act cases, and compulsory
arbitration of automobile negligence cases.

        ApPOINTMENT AND COMPENSATION OF BAILIFFS

   The Conference, upon the recommendation of the Committee
on Supporting Personnel with the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration concurring, reaffirmed its recommendation made at the
March 1955 Session that the power of employing bailiffs be trans­
ferred from the marshals to the district judges in whose courts they
are to serve and that bailiffs so employed be specifically vested
with the powers of a deputy United States Marshal in the perform­
ance of their duties (Conf. Rept. p. 8). To accomplish this pur­
pose, amendment of Title 28, United States Code will be required,
                                  16 

in which event the transfer of appropriations for the compensation
of bailiffs from the Department of Justice to the court                    f

appropriations will follow automatically.
MINIMUM STANDARDS OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROBATION OFFICERS

   Upon the recommendation of the Committee on Supporting
Personnel, with the concurrence of the Committee on Court
Administration, the Conference renewed its recommendation that
appropriate legislation be enacted to empower the Conference to
promulgate minimum standards which must be met by all proba­
tion officers to be appointed in the future. This recommendation
was adopted at the September 1955 Session of the Conference
(Conf. Rept. p. 11).
    USE OF COURT FACILITIES BY OTHER AGENCIES OF THE
                            GOVERNMENT

   Judge Biggs called the attention of the Conference to the fact
that at a recent hearing before the Senate Committee on Appro­
priations the statement had been made that some courts had shown
reluctance to permit the use of court facilities in public buildings by
other Government agencies for official purposes when not in use
                                                                          t..

by the courts and that this had been the subject of comment in the
Committee's Report on the Appropriation Bill for the courts for
the current fiscal year.
   The Conference, on motion of Judge Biggs, agreed that the Chief
Judges should call this matter to the attention of the district judges
in their respective circuits to the end that court rooms and facilities
may be made available for appropriate use by all Government
agencies to the extent that such employment will not interfere with
their primary use by the courts.
      ADDITIONAL MATTERS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE
                    ON COURT ADMINISTRATION

   L A recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
Circuit that "by rule or legislation the presiding judges of divisions
or in banc hearings of the Courts of Appeals be required to make
quarterly reports of the pendency of their submitted cases, such
as are now required of the district judges" was referred to the Com­
mittee on Court Administration for consideration.                         .~ 

                                      17
      2. The proposed legislation contained in a Bill (S. 3744 of the
    84th Congress) entitled "A Bill To establish a United States Court
    of Appeals for Patents, and for other purposes" was referred to the
    Committee on Court Administration for consideration.
    SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS
       On motion of Chief Judge Jones, the Conference adopted the
    following resolution:
           Resolved, that it is the sense of the Judicial Conference that
         the grades and salaries of the supporting personnel of the
         Court of Claims, not otherwise fixed by law, should correspond
         with the grades and salaries of comparable positions of the
         supporting personnel of the other United States Courts.
           The Conference approves such revision of the appropriation
         estimates of the Court of Claims as may be necessary to ef­
         fectuate this resolution.
      The Conference authorized the Committee on Supporting Per­
    sonnel to consider the grades and salaries of the supporting per­
    sonnel of the Court of Claims.

o        DUTIES OF PROBATION OFFICERS UNDER THE
             FEDERAL YOUTH CORRECTIONS ACT
       The Administrative Office was instructed to inform the Probation
    Officers that it is the sense of the Conference that they should
    cooperate to the fullest extent with the Department of Justice in
    the administration of the Federal Youth Corrections Act with
    respect to the supervision of youth offenders as required by Title 18,
    U. S. C., § 5019, and making reports to the Youth Correction Divi­
    sion concerning such offenders as required by § 5016 of that Title.
    UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS FOR CUMBERLAND
            GAP NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK
      The attention of the Conference was called to Public Law 793
    of the 84th Congress approved July 25, 1956, providing for the
    appointment of two United States commissioners for Cumberland
    Gap National Historical Park, one with jurisdiction limited to the
    portion of the park situated in Kentucky to be appointed by the
    district court for the Eastern District of Kentucky and the other
    with jurisdiction limited to the portion of the park situated in Ten­
    nessee and Virginia to be appointed by joint action of the district
                                 18 

courts for the Eastern District of Tennessee and the Western Dis­
trict of Virginia.
   The Conference approved a maximum salary limit of $1,200 for
each of the two commissioners authorized to be appointed and
directed the Administrative Office to inform the courts concerned
of its action and request that they fix salaries for the park commis­
sioners within this maximum limit pursuant to the provisions of
Section 634 of Title 28, United States Code.

 SALARY OF DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
  The Conference renewed its recommendation that the salary of
the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts be set at $22,500 per year, which is the salary of a United
States District Judge.

             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   Circuit Judge Phillips, chairman of the Committee on Bank­
ruptcy Administration, reported that the Committee had met and
considered the recommendations contained in the report of the
Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office which was ap­
proved by the Director on August 18, 1956, relating to certain          f

changes in salaries and arrangements for referees and to the filling
of vacancies in certain referees' positions. The report was made
in the light of the amendment of Section 40a of the Bankruptcy
Act (11 U. S. C. 68a) Public Law 518, 84th Congress, approved
May 10, 1956, which increased the maximum annual salaries that
may be fixed by the Conference to $15,000 for f lll-time referees
and to $7,500 for part-time referees. The report was based upon
a resurvey covering each referee position in the system.
   The survey extended previous surveys through June 30, 1956
and took into account both for the district and for each referee's
office, the number, size and character of new cases referred to the
referees since July 1, 1947; the number, size and character of pend­
ing cases and the payments by each district and by each referee,
into the referees' salary and expense funds so far as available.
   The report had been circulated by the Director among the dis­
trict judges and the Judicial Councils as well as the members of
the Judicial Conference. The Committee also had before it the
recommendations of the district judges and the Judicial Councils        ,

and these, with the report of the Committee, were before the Con­       ,

ference. The Committee agreed upon recommendations which
                                                            19 

were contained in a written report submitted to the Conference.
Except in a few instances the report of the Committee approved
the report of the Administrative Office. The Conference, after
discussion, approved the report of the Committee with regard to
changes in salaries and arrangements and the filling of vacancies
and in accordance with the report fixed the salaries of referees in
the amount shown in the following Table L It directed that the
increases in salary, the changes in arrangements and the authori­
zations for the filling of vacancies shown in Tables I and II (except
where otherwise noted) should take effect October 1, 1956, subject
to the procurement of the necessary appropriation.

             MISCELLANEOUS BANKRUPTCY MATTERS

   Section 60 and Related Sections.-At the meeting of the Con­
ference in March 1956, the Bankruptcy Committee through its
Subcommittee was authorized to continue its study and report to
the full Committee. The Committee was also authorized in con­
nection with such study to consider proposals to enlarge the sum­
mary jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. The Subcommittee
consisting of Circuit Judge John B. Sanborn, Chairman, District
Judge Albert V. Bryan, Member and Edwin L. Covey, Advisor,
reported to the Committee that drafts of amendments prepared
by the Drafting Committee of the National Bankruptcy Confer­
 ence had been made I1vailable to it but that the Subcommittee had
not yet had an opportunity to study the proposed amendments.
 The Committee recommended that it be authorized to continue its
 study of Section 60 and related sections.
    The Subcommittee was of the view that specific grants of sum­
 mary jurisdiction to the bankruptcy court should be enlarged so as
 to enable the court through its officers more promptly, economically
 and efficiently to administer the various recovery and avoidance
 provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. It recommended that the plen­
 ary jurisdictional provisions now contained in Sections 60b, 67e and
 70e (3) be stricken from these sections and that amendments be
 adopted in each instance so as to give the court, after due notice to
 all parties in interest, summary jurisdiction of any proceeding
 brought under these sections for the purpose of recovering or avoid­
 ing any preference, transfer or obligation.                         .
    The Bankruptcy Committee approved the report of the Sub­
  committee with a special concurrence by District Judge Lynne, who
  agreed that the enlargement of summary jurisdiction would expe­
  dite and make more economical the administration of bankruptcy
  estates, but had some misgivings that the substitution of summary
  jurisdiction for plenary proceedings in the case of adverse claimants
  having more than merely colourable claims would deprive such
  claimants of a cherished right to have their cases heard in the first
  instance before a judge or jury instead of a referee.
     The Conference directed that the report of the Committee with
  regard to summary jurisdiction be circulated among the judges for
  an expression of views pursuant to the "Phillips Plan" (Jud. Conf.
  Rept. Sept. 1945 Sess. pp. 9, 10); that all views expressed be com­
  municated to the Committee on Bankruptcy Administration of the
                                 26 

Conference for its consideration; and that the Bankruptcy Com­
mittee make further report to the Conference at its next regular
meeting.                                                                (
   Changes in Additional Charges for the Referees' Salary and Ex­
pense Funds.-The Committee reported that pursuant to Section
40c (2) of the Bankruptcy Act the Acting Director had recom­
mended that the schedules of additional fees and charges now in
effect for the Referees' Salary and Expense Funds be revised as
follows effective as to all cases filed on and after January 1, 1957:

    FEES TO BE CHARGED IN ASSET, ARRANGEMENT AND WAGE­
            EARNER CASES JfOR THE REFEREES' SALARY FUND

    One percent on net realization in straight bankruptcy cases
      with a minimum charge of $2.50 in each Asset and Nominal
     Asset case.
    One-half of one percent on total obligations paid or extended
      in Chapter XI cases.
    One-half of one percent upon payments made by or for the
     debtor in Chapter XIII cases.

      CHARGES TO BE MADE IN ASSET, ARRANGEMENT AND WAGE­
           EARNER CASES FOR THE REFEREES' EXPENSE FUND                  (

    Referees' expenses in Chapter XIII cases at $10 per case
      where the liabilities do not exceed $200, and at $15 per case
      in all other Chapter XIII cases.
    One and one-half percent on the first $50,000 and one percent
      on the balance of the net realization in straight bankruptcy
      cases with a minimum charge of $2.50 in each Asset and
      Nominal Asset case.
    One-half of one percent on total obligations paid or extended
      in Chapter XI cases.
    One-half of one percent upon payments made by or for the
      debtor in Chapter XIII cases.
  The Committee reported that the estimated surplus in the Ref­
erees' Expense Fund for 1958 would be approximately $300.00.
This small surplus is due primarily to a new provision in Section
4a of the Civil Service Retirement Act as amended (Public Law
854, 84th Congress) approved July 1, 1956, which requires that
effective July 1, 1957, a sum equal to the amount deducted from
the employee's salary for the retirement fund shall be contributed      (
                                 27 

from the appropriation or fund out of which such compensation
is paid. This sum computed at six and one-half percent on the
salaries paid to all clerks in referees' offices was estimated at
$99,000. This, together with the other increases in the estimated
expenditures for 1958 would practically exhaust the estimated
receipts in the Expense Fund for that year.
   Upon the recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee the
Conference approved the schedules of additional fees and charges
as recommended by the Acting Director.
   Proposal to amend General Order 17 (1) of the Supreme Court.­
The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference a
tecent amendment of Section 58e of the Bankruptcy Act (Public
Law 933, 84th Cong.) approved August 2, 1956, which relieved
the clerk of the district court of the duty of sending to the Com­
missioner of Internal Revenue and the Comptroller General, a
certified copy of the order of adjudication in bankruptcy. It also
relieved the court (usually the referee) from the duty of sending a
copy of the notice of the first meeting of creditors, which includes
in it a notice of the date of adjudication in bankruptcy, to the Com­
missioner of Internal Revenue. The requirement for the mailing
of such notice by the court to the Director of Internal Revenue
of the district where the case is filed was continued and is now the
only notice desired by the Internal Revenue Service since the
decentralization of that Department. The Internal Revenue
Service also desires to be relieved of the labor of handling and pro­
cessing in Washington, the notice of adjudication now required to
be sent by the Trustee pursuant to General Order 17 (1).
   The Committee pointed out that the mailing of the notice of
adjudication by the Trustee was a duplication of information
already sent to the District Director of Internal Revenue and
recommended that the Conference request the amendment of
General Order 17 (1) by the Supreme Court so as to read as fol­
lows: "The Trustee shall, immediately upon entering upon his
duties, prepare a complete inventory of all the property of the
bankrupt or debtor that comes into his possession."
The Conference approved the recommendation of the Committee.
   Proposal to amend Sections 14b and 58b of the Bankruptcy
Act.-The Committee recommended that the Conference
reaffirm its approval of legislation to amend Sections 14b and 58b
of the Bankruptcy Act so as to provide for the combining of notices
of the time fixed for filing objections to the discharge of the bank­
     407072-116--1)
                                28 

rupt with the notice of the first meeting of creditors whenever
possible. The Conference approved the recommendation.                 (
   Proposal to Amend Section 331 of the Bankruptcy Act.-The
Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its ap­
proval of legislation to amend Section 331 of Chapter XI (Ar­
rangements) of the Bankruptcy Act so as to provide for the refer­
ence of Chapter XI proceedings by the clerk of the court to a ref­
eree in the absence of all the district judges from the district or
division in which the proceeding is filed, the same as may be done
llOW in ~luntary straight bankruptcy cases. The Conference
approved.

PROPOSAL To AMEND SECTIONS 2a, 11 AND SECTION 14c (3) so AS To
  GIVE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT JURISDICTION To DETERMINE THE
  DISCHARGEABILITY OR NONDISCHARGEABILITY OF PROVABLE DEBTS
  AS PROVIDED IN H. R. 11543 (CELLER) 84TH CONGRESS
   The chairman brought to the attention of the Conference a
bill (H. R. 11543) introduced on May 31, 1956, by Congressman
Celler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which would
authorize the courts of bankruptcy to determine the discharge­
ability or nondischargeabilty of provable debts. The Commit­          (
tee reported that Congressman Celler had requested that the bill
be brought to the attention of the Bankruptcy Committee and
the Judicial Conference.
   As to Section 2a, H. R. 11543 would add at the end of the sec­
tion as subparagraph 22 a new grant of jurisdiction to the courts
of bankruptcy to "determine the dischargeability or nondischarge­
ability of all provable debts" and would further provide "If a case
is reopened solely for the purpose of determining such discharge­
ability or nondischargeability, no additional filing fee shall be
collected."
   Section 2 of H. R. 11543 would amend Section 11a of the
Bankruptcy Act so as to give the bankruptcy courts express au­
thority to stay suits commenced against a bankrupt after bank­
ruptcy as well as before, until the question of dischargeability
or nondischargeabilty of a particular debt is determined.
   Section 3 of H. R. 11543 would repeal clause 3 of Section 14c
of the Bankruptcy Act which now provides "the court shall grant
the discharges unless satisfied that the bankrupt has" .. * (3)
obtained money or property on credit, or obtained an extension or
renewal of credit, by making or publishing or causing to be made
                                 29 

or published in any manner whatsoever, a materially false state­
ment in writing respecting his financial condition; * * it."
   The Committee expressed the view that there can be no ques­
tion that the liability created by the extension of credit in reliance
upon a materially false statement in writing should not be dis­
charged. But to deny a complete discharge as to all claims cre­
ated without any knowledge whatever of the issuance of such a
statement places too great a penalty upon the bankrupt as well
as gives too great a benefit to those creditors whose debts were
created without any knowledge of the false statement and without
any participation in the proceeding looking to the denial of the
discharge.
   The Committee recommended that the Conference approve in
principle H. R. 11543. The Conference approved this recommend­
ation.
   Costs of Bankruptcy Administration.-The Committee reported
that the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office had
made extensive studies of the costs of adminstration in asset cases
in 17 districts. These cost studies were carefully considered by
the Bankruptcy Committee which recommended that the Bank­
ruptcy Division of the Administrative Office continue its cost
studies; that the results thereof be brought to the attention of
the referees, where the costs of administration recurrently exceed
the national average; that where corrective and cooperative results
are not obtained, the studies be brought to the attention of the
district courts and, if deemed necessary, to the attention of the
circuit councils. The Conference approved this recommendation.
      AIR CONDITIONING OF COURT QUARTERS
   Chief Judge Parker, chairman of the Committee on Air Condi­
tioning of Court Quarters, presented the report of the Committee,
which was approved by the Conference.
   The report informed the Conference that $575,000 had been in­
cluded in the appropriations for the courts for the current fiscal
year to continue the program of air conditioning of court quarters
which was commenced last year (Conf. Repts. Sept. 1955 Sess. p.
21; March 1956 Sess. p. 18). After the passage of the Act con­
taining this appropriation the Committee met and determined the
projects for which it should be used.
   The Committee recommended that the sum of $1,500,000 be
included in the appropriation estimates of the courts for the fiscal
                                       30 

year 1958 to carry forward the air conditioning program includ­
ing air conditioning of quarters of supporting personnel of the
courts where needed according to the following priorities:
     1.   Offices of Clerks of Court
     2.   Offices of Referees in Bankruptcy
     3.   Probation Offices
     4.   Grand Jury Rooms
  The Conunittee recommended that the Administrative Office
obtain the views of the Judicial Councils of the several circuits
as to the offices of supporting personnel to. be air conditioned within
the circuit and also the views of the several Councils as to whether
any additional court rooms should be placed in a higher priority
than quarters of supporting personnel.

              . THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM

   The Administrative .Office submitted a report on the court
reporting system which informed the. Conference that, as reflected
by their reports .submitted to that Office, the reporters during the
fiscal year ending June 30,1956, had average earnings from salaries
plus net profits from ()fficial and private reporting of $10,403.56,
an increase of $211.73 over the average earnings for the preceding
fiscal year. The median earnings reported were $10,056.65, an
increase of $869.58 over the preceding year. At the September
1955 Session (Conf. Rept. pp. 19-20) the Conference increased the
salaries of the court reporters by 7Jf2percent pursuant to authorizac
tion contained in the;Federal Employees Salary Increase Act of
1955, retroactive to March 14, 1955. The table of earnings for the
fiscal year 1955, with which the earnings for 1956 were compared,
does not include that part of the increase in salaries applicable to
the period between March 14, 1955 and June 30,1955, because the
table was prepared before the retroactive increases had been
granted.
   The Conference was informed that its action also taken at the
September 1955 Session to fix the salaries of reporters who had been
receiving $4,500 per year at $5,000 per year plus the 7Jf2 percent
increase when funds should become available had been put into
effect on May 21, 1956, so that there are presently three .classes of
reporters in terms of annual salaries received, namely, those re­
ceiving $5,375 per year, those receiving $5,915 per year, and those
receiving $6,450 per year which is the maximum permitted by law.
                                31 

      CHANGES IN SPECIFIC SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS

   Upon the recommendation of the Administrative Office the
reporter for the Western District of Wisconsin was authorized to
serve also as a United States Commissioner and receive the fees
earned by him in the latter capacity in addition to his salary as
court reporter of $5,375 per year.
   Also upon the recommendation of the Administrative Office, the
Conference authorized an increase in the salaries of the reporters
in the Western District of Missouri from $5,915 per year to $6,450
per year.
   The Conference concurred in a recommendation of the Adminis­
trative Office that no changes be made in the present salaries of
 the reporters in the Eastern District of Virginia at Norfolk and the
 Southern District of Mississippi with regard to which requests
 had been submitted.
       PROPOSALS OF THE CONFERENCE OF UNITED STATES
                         COURT REPORTERS

  The Conference received, but took no action with respect to
recommendations of the Conference of United States Court Re­
porters that the salaries of the court reporters be reviewed to the
end that salaries would be increased and a plan devised to provide
salary increases from time to time comparable to within-grade pro­
motions granted to employees who are classified in grades; that
transcript rates be raised; and that a committee of the Conference
be designated to hear representatives of the reporters with regard
to their proposals.                                                 '
         PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE COURT REPORTING ACT

    The Conference disapproved the enactment of proposed legisla­
 tion contained in S.. 3495 of the 84th Congress to amend the law
 providing for official court reporters.                       ....
    The.Conference was informed that the proponents of this pro­
 posed legislation, acting in behalf of various independent court
 reporters, have alleged that there exist in the Northern District of
 Illinois certain improper practices by official reporters. Having
 had this matter presented to it, and having no means to investigate
 it, the Conference referred it to the Judicial Council of the Seventh
  Circuit for appropriate action, and also to the Department of
  Justice for the information of the Department.
                                  32 

   Also the Conference was informed that in one or more districts
the official court reporters do not regularly devote their personal
services to reporting, employing substitutes instead. Accordingly,
attention was directed to the following action of the Conference at
the April 1944 Special Session called to consider matters relating
to the then recently enacted statute establishing the system of of­
ficial court reporters for the courts:
        "It was the sense of the Conference that each reporter
      should devote his personal services to the duties of his position,
      but that when he needs assistance for the purpose of furnish­
      ing transcripts of proceedings currently or for other reasons he
      should be permitted to employ assistants satisfactory to the
      judge of the court whose proceedings he is reporting, to be
      compensated by the reporter." (Con£. Rept. Apr. 1944 Sess.
      p.3).
                         APPROPRIATIONS
   The estimates submitted by the Administrative Office pursuant
to the statute (28 U. S. C. Sec. 605) for annual appropriations for
the support of the courts for the fiscal year 1958 and supplemental
appropriations for 1957 were approved.
   For the first time the budget included the estimates for the Court
of Claims for approval by the Conference as provided by Public
Law 659 of the 84th Congress, approved July 9, 1956.
   An estimate in the amount of $218,000 was included for the
Judicial Survivors Annuity Fund to match the amount which it is
estimated will accrue to the fund during the year from the 3 per­
cent deductions made from the salaries of the judges who elect
to bring themselves within the purview of Public Law 973 of the
84th Congress, approved August 3, 1956 providing for the payment
of annuities to widows and dependent children of judges upon a
contributory basis.
   Funds were also included to implement the recommendations of
the Conference made at the March 1956 Session relating to the
grades and salaries of secretaries of judges (Conf. Rept. p. 4) and
reclassification of Clerks of Court and their staffs (Conf. Rept.
p.3).
   Authority was granted to the Administrative Office to make such
changes in the estimates as may be required by actions of the Con­
 ference at this session including increases in the estimates for          f'
Salaries and Expenses of Referees in Bankruptcy.                            f
              The estimates of supplemental appropriations for the current
   r\      fiscal year included additional funds for the appropriation for
    '.,)   salaries of judges; for the Court of Claims to pay salary increases
           pursuant to the Federal Executive Pay Act of 1956; for fees of
           jurors; and for salaries of Referees in Bankruptcy.

           COMMITTEE ON 	 THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                          CRIlVIINAL LAW
             Chief Judge Parker, chairman, submitted the report of the
           Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.
                           ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES

              Bills to provide for review of sentences by the Courts of Appeals
           in criminal cases (S. 1480, H. R. 4930 and H. R. 4932) were intro­
           duced in the 84th Congress. Arguments for and against the pro­
           posed legislation were summarized for the Committee in a memo­
           randum prepared by Judge Picard, a member of the Committee.
           A majority of the Committee were tentatively of the view that
           such legislation is unwise and undesirable, but before reaching a
           final conclusion in the matter the Committee recommended that
           the proposal be circulated among the judges and Judicial Confer­
           ences of the circuits pursuant to the "Phillips Plan" (Jud. Conf.
           Rept. Sept. 1945 Sess. pp. 9, 10). The Conference approved the
           recommendation of the Committee for the circulation of this
           proposal.
           PROPOSAL   To AMEND THE LAWS RELATING TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL
                                      CONTEMPTS

             The Committee had considered a proposal originating in the
           Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit, based on a study made
           by a committee of the Junior Barristers of the Los Angeles Bar
           Association. See 19 Federal Rules Decisions page 167 et seq.
           The Committee was not of the opinion that need for legislation
           along this line is sufficiently pressing to warrant action by the
           Conference in making a recommendation to Congress, but thought
           that this matter might well be given consideration by the Commit­
           tee on Rules in the event such a committee is revived by the
           Supreme Court.

      PROPOSAL To AMEND TITLE 28, U. S. C., SEC. 2255
   Consideration had been given by the Committee to a proposal
coming from the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit that section
2255 of Title 28, United States Code, be amended so as to provide
that "In cases where it appears to the sentencing court that the
prisoner should be produced for a hearing, the court, in the exer­
cise of its sound judicial discretion, may either require the pris­
oner's presence and proceed with such hearing or may dismiss the
motion and remit the prisoner to his remedy by habeas corpus."
This matter was referred to the Committee by the Conference at
the March 1956 Session (Conf. Rept. p. 18). The Committee
stated that the purpose of section 2255 of Title 28, U. S. C., was to
prevent action of a sentencing court being reviewed by the judge of
another court on writ of habeas corpus and the Committee did not
think that there was any pressing need for amendment of the
section.
                          HABEAS CORPUS

  The Committee reported that the bill heretofore indorsed by the
Conference relating to use of habeas corpus by the lower Federal
courts to review state court action (H. R. 5649 of the 84th Con-        .)
gress) had passed the House of Representatives but was not taken
up by the Senate before the adjournment of the Congress. (See
Jud. Conf. Repts. Sept. 1955 Sess. p. 23; March 1956 Sess. p. 17).
The Committee recommended that the Conference again approve
the proposed legislation. No action was taken on this recom­
mendation.

PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO COUNSEL ApPOINTED                      TO
       REPRESENT POOR PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME

   The Committee reported that Congress has taken no action with
respect to providing public defenders in the Federal courts or auth­
orizing payment of compensation to counsel appointed by the
courts to represent indigent defendants accused of crime. Upon
the recommendation of the Committee the Conference renewed
its approval of the proposed legislation heretofore approved by it
for this purpose. (See Conf. Repts. Sept. 1£154 Sess. p. 31; March
1955 Sess. p. 21; Sept. 1955 Seas. p. 29.)

     DEATH    OF   CoURT    REPORTER     BEFORE    NOTES    OF   TRIAL   ARE
                                  TRANSCRIBED

        The Committee reported that it had given consideration to a
     proposal that legislation be recommended requiring a new trial
     in civil and criminal cases wherever the reporter who makes the
     stenographic notes of the testimony on which the judgment is
     based, dies before the notes are transcribed, but saw no need for
     action in this field because the trial judge has power, in the interests
     of justice, to order a new trial in such a situation.

            ApPEALS BY THE UNITED STATES IN CRn.UNAL CASES

       The Committee recommended that H. R. 9364 of the 84th Con­
     gress be approved with an amendment. The bill would amend
     existing law, 18 U. S. C. 3731, so as to provide for an appeal by the
     United States from an adverse decision on a motion to suppress
     evidence. After discussion, the amendment was withdrawn, and
     the Conference voted to approve the proposed legislation in the
     form in which it was introduced in the 84th Congress.
                              RULES C-OMMITTEE

       The Committee reported that it is of opinion that a standing
     committee of the Supreme Court on Rules of Civil and Criminal
     Procedure would be of great value, not only in providing a stand­
     ing body of competence and experience to consider suggested
     changes in procedure as they may be brought forward from various
     sources, but also making less likely the enactment of undesirable
     legislation by Congress interfering with the exercise of the rule
     making power by the Supreme Court. Accordingly it recom­
     mended that the Conference recommend to the Supreme Court
     that the Court revive, reconstitute and consolidate its committees
     on Civil and Criminal Rules. The Conference adopted the
     recommendation.
         ADDITIONAL MATTERS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON
               THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL             LAw
       1. A recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
     Circuit that the definition of a felony be amended was referred to
(    the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law for con­
\.
     sideration. The proposal is that paragTaph 1 of section 1 of
                                      36
Title 18, United States Code, defining a felony, be amended to read
as follows:
                                                                                    1"1.,
        "(1) Any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for
     a term exceeding one year is a felony: Provided, that when a
     per80n i8 convicted of any felony and the 8entence imp08ed
     by the court doe8 not provide for impri80nment for a term
     exceeding one year, such per80n 8hall, for all purp08e8, after
     the judgment of conviction 8hall have become final and after
     the 8entence imp08ed upon him 8hall have expired, be deemed
     to have been charged with and convicted of a mi8demeanor,
     and 8uch per80n 8hall not 8uffer any di8ability or disqualifica­
     tion which would otherwi8e result from a conviction of a
     felony." (New matter proposed to be added in italics.)
  2. A recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
Circuit for amendment of the Probation Law was also referred to
the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law for
consideration. The proposed amendment would add the following
paragraph to section 3651 of Title 18, United States Code:
      Whenever a defendant has fulfilled the conditions of probation for the
   entire period thereof, or shall have been discharged from probation prior         '1J
                                                                                    tl\"j
   to the termination of the period thereof, the Court, after notice given by the
   Probation Officer to the probationer and the United States Attorney, shall,
   unless good cause to the contrary is shown, set aside the verdict of guilty,
   or plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and dismiss the indictment or informa­
   tion against such defendant. Such defendant shall thereafter be released
   from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense or crime of
   which he bas been convicted.

                       JUDICIAL STATISTICS
   Chief Judge Clark presented the report of the Committee on
Judicial Statistics which included an account of the work of the
Committee during the year and its recommendations to the Com­
mittee on Court Administration, made at the request of the latter,
of additional district judgeships necessary to bring the dockets of
the courts to a condition where the ordinary civil case could be
tried within 6 months of filing. He stated the desire of the Commit­
tee on Court Administration to have a study made of future trends
of litigation in the Federal courts and in pursuance thereof pre­
sented the following resolution contained in the Committee report:
     RESOLVED, that this Committee endeavor to estimate and transmit to             ~\)
   the Judicial Conference and to the Committees on Court Administration              .
   and Supporting Personnel its recommendations as to the number of judge­
                                              37 

            ships necessary to take care of the judicial case-load as it will be at that
            period in the future when it is estimated the judges appointed to fill the
            recommended judgeships will take office; and it was further moved that this
            Committee recommend to the Judicial Conference the number of judgeships
            necessary to bring the dockets of the courts to a reasonably current condi­
            tion three years from this time for each individual district in the Federal
            system.
           The resolution was adopted by the Conference with the under­
         standing that a statement of the future recommendations of the
         Statistics Committee concerning additional judgeuhips should be
         supplied to the Judicial Councils of the Circuits involved and to the
         district judges of the districts in which additions are recommended
         in sufficient time to enable them to express their opinions on the
         recommendations of the Committee before the meeting of the Judi­
         cial Conference to which the recommendations are submitted.
            Judge Clark also asked approval of a recommendation of the
         Committee for authorization to the Administrative Office for a
         further follow up on matters reported to it as under advisement
         by any district judge in his quarterly report for more than 3 months
         but less than 6 months. The inquiry would be sent by the Office
         to such judge on the date which is 6 months after the case was taken
         under advisement, asking the judge for a report on its status. Cases
         reported as still pending decision could then be reported imme­
         diately to the Chief Judge and the Judicial Council of the Circuit.
         Exceptions should be made:
             (1) 	Where the date of the follow-up letter would be within 2 weeks of the
                  end of the quarter or within a month of his last report.
             (2) 	 Where the judge is sick.
             (3) 	Where he has indicated in his last quarterly report that the case will
                  be disposed of promptly or cannot be disposed of promptly because of
                  length of the record, etc.
          The recommendation was approved.
          The Administrative Office was authorized to circulate the Com­
         mittee report among the circuit and district judges.

                              PRE-TRIAL PROCEDURE
            Judge Murrah, chairman of the Committee on Pre-trial Pro­
         cedure, reported to the Judicial Conference on the progress being
         made in expanding the use and improving the techniques of pre­
         trial procedure in the district courts. He submitted the report of
(
         the Committee including the following resolution with reference to
\   ..   the amendment of Rule 16:
                                 38
      "It is the sense of this Committee that Rule 16 should be        I'
                                                                       /
    amended in such manner as to require that a pre-trial confer­
    ence be held in every civil case, with the reservation, however,
    that upon the written application of a judge of any district,
    exemption from this requirement, as to a particular division
    or court seat, may be made only by the affirmative action,
    through general or special order, of the circuit council, deter­
    mining that the purpose of holding pre-trial conferences
    therein would be defeated by excessive expense or other good
    cause."
   The action of the Conference in recommending to the district
judges the use of pre-trial procedure in every case before trial or
the entry of an order dispensing with it rather than advocating an
amendment of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is stated in
connection with the report of the Committee on Court Administra­
tion.
           OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  Judge Watkins, chairman, submitted the report of the Commit­
tee on the Operation of the Jury System.                               ~)

       USE OF CERTIFIED MAIL FOR SUMMONING JURORS

   With the object of saving money, the Committee recommended
the enactment of legislation to amend Title 28, U. S. C., sec. 1867
so as to permit the use of the newly developed "certified mail" in
lieu of "registered mail" for summoning prospective jurors. It was
estimated that this would result in a saving of more than $12,000
per year in postage costs. The Conference adopted the recommen­
dation and approved for submission to the next session of Congress
the draft of a bill for this purpose prepared by the Committee.

      MILEAGE AND SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE FOR JURORS

   Because of increased costs of travel, hotel rates, and meals, the
Committee recommended that the mileage allowance of jurors be
raised from 7 cents per mile as presently allowed to 10 cents per
mile, which is the mileage rate now allowed by the Government for
travel by automobile of Government employees generally, and that
the daily subsistence allowance be increased from $5 to $7 for jurors • \
required to stay overnight away from their homes at the place ofl
holding court. It was pointed out that there has been no increase
                                39 

in these amounts since July 14, 1949. The Committee did not at
this time recommend an increase in the jurors fee of $7 per day
although considerable sentiment had been expressed that this
amount should be increased also.
   The Conference adopted the recommendation of the Committee
and approved for submission to the next session of Congress the
draft of a bill for this purpose prepared by the Committee.
       NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES OF JURORS

   At the March 1956 Session, the Conference referred to the Com­
mittee a proposal from the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit that
section 1870 of Title 28, U. S. Code relating to the number of per­
emptory challenges of jurors allowable in civil cases be amended
(Conf. Rept. p. 17). The recommendation was that there be
allowed additional peremptory challenges to all multiple parties
instead of to multiple defendants only as at present. The Com­
mittee recommended the proposed change. The Conference
adopted the recommendation of the Committee and approved for
submission to the next session of Congress the draft of a bill pre­
pared by the Committee for this purpose.
                         JURY COMMISSION

  Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
reaffirmed its approval of proposed legislation to provide for a jury
commission for each United States District Court, to regulate its
compensation, to prescribe its duties, and for other purposes, and
authorized the Committee to seek its enactment in the next Con­
gress. The enactment of this bill has been advocated by the Judi­
cial Conference since 1943.
             UNIFORM QUALIFICATIONS FOR JURORS,

  The Conference adopted the recommendation of the Committee
that it reaffirm its approval of proposed legislation to establish
uniform qualifications for jurors in Federal courts, and seek its
enactment in the next Congress. The Committee pointed out
that one of the main purposes of this bill is to qualify women for
jury service, and informed the Conference that although it has not
passed in the more than ten years during which it has been advo­
cated by the Conference, public attention has been brought to bear
on the subject by the Hearings which have been held on it and that
                                  40 

there are now only four States in which women are not permitted
to serve as jurors.                                                       .)1
          NUMBER OF JURORS REQUIRED FOR VERDICTS

   Pursuant to authorization given at the September 1955 Session
(Conf. Rept. p. 25) the Committee had studied a bill introduced
in the 84th Congress (H. R. 565) which would provide that in a
civil action tried by a jury, other than one tried by a jury "as a mat­
ter of right guaranteed by the seventh amendment to the Consti­
tution", the number of jurors required to constitute the jury and
the number who must agree for a valid verdict or finding should be
determined by the law of the State in which the action is tried; or,
if there is no State law on the subject, the number of jurors shall be
12 and the verdict or finding shall be valid if 10 of them agree.
The Committee recommended that the Conference disapprove the
proposed legislation, and the Conference adopted the recommenda­
tion.
                       COST OF JURY SYSTEM

   A report prepared by the Administrative Office on the cost of
the operation of the jury system for the fiscal year ended June 30,       .\1
1956, similar to reports prepared for previous years, was submitted       ~)l/J
to the Conference by the Committee. At the Committee's request
the Conference authorized the report to be distributed among the
judges for their information to the end that jury costs may be kept
to the lowest level consistent with efficient operation of the
system.

        COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Judge Maris, chairman, submitted the report of the Committee
on Revision of the Laws.
   REMOVAL OF CAUSES FROM STATE TO FEDERAL COURTS

  L There had been presented to the Committee through the
Administrative Office a request by the chairman of the Committee
on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives for the views of
the Judicial Conference with respect to a proposal by Professor
George B. Fraser of the College of Law of the University of Okla­
homa, that section 1446 of Title 28, United States Code, be                1ft
amended so as to provide that the removal of a case from the State         '# .
                                 41

to the Federal court should be effected by the filing of the removal
petition in the Federal court rather than by the subsequent filing
of a copy of that petition in the State court. The Committee
recognized that theoretically questions may arise as to the power
of the Federal court to deal with a case in the interval between
these two events, although it had not learned of any difficulties
which have occurred in this regard in practice since the enactment
of section 1446. It was the view of the Committee that Professor
Fraser's proposal as an original proposition has merit, although
the need for such a change has not been shown to be sufficiently
pressing to call for passage of legislation to effect it alone. The
Committee therefore recommended that the Conference authorize
the Director of the Administrative Office to inform the chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee that the Conference regards
the proposal as one which should be considered in connection with
the next bill which may be prepared for the general improvement
of the various titles of the United States Code but is not considered
sufficiently urgent to call for immediate consideration in a separate
bilL The Conference adopted the recommendation.
   2. The Administrative Office had presented to the Committee
a suggestion transmitted to it by the Deputy Attorney General
from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa
that the procedure for removal of causes be modified by requiring
that the original papers in the State court be transmitted to and
filed in the Federal court in lieu of copies. The Committee after
considering this proposal concluded that it should not be approved
because it appears to have certain practical disadvantages in pro­
ceedings in which the entire law suit in a State court is not removed
and also presents questions of the constitutional power of the Con­
gress to require a soverign State to deliver up its public records to
the Federal government without its consent. The Committee ac­
cordingly recommended that the Director of the Administrative
Office be authorized to inform the Attorney General that the Judi­
cial Conference does not approve this proposal. The Conference
adopted the recommendation.
WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS WITH RESPECT TO PERSONS HELD IN
  INSTITUTIONS IN VIRGINIA FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES COMMITTED
  IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

  A resolution adopted by the Judicial Conference of the District
of Columbia Circuit disapproving S. 448 of the 84th Congress was
                                  42 


referred to the Committee at the September 1955 session (Conf.
Rept. p. 28). This bill would confer jurisdiction on the United            ~
States District Court for the District of Columbia to issue writs of       4
habeas corpus with respect to persons held in institutions in Vir­
ginia for criminal offenses committed in the District of Columbia.
The Committee reported that it saw no reason why the traditional
principle that habeas corpus jurisdiction applies only to persons
held in the territorial bailiwick of the Court should be departed
from in this case and that this was particularly so in view of the
fact that under section 2255 of Title 28, United States Code, which
is applicable to the District Court and Municipal Court of the
District of Columbia, relief can be obtained by prisoners held in
Virginia under the judgments of those courts which is substantially
equivalent to that which might be obtained by a writ of habeas
corpus. Also in view of the provisions of the last paragraph of
section 2255 it would appear that the jurisdiction proposed to be
conferred by this bill would in practice be exercisable only in the
rarest of cases; that section 2255 has in effect engrossed this field of
jurisdiction. The Conference adopted the recommendation of the
Committee and the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia
Circuit that this proposed legislation be disapproved.
ADMISSION TO THE BAR OF COURTS OF ApPEALS AND DISTRICT
                  COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES

   The Conference at the September 1955 session referred to the
Committee a resolution of the Judicial Conference of the District
of Columbia Circuit disapproving H. R. 828 of the 84th Congress
amending Title 28 of the United States Code with respect to eligi­
bility of members of the bar of the United States Supreme Court
to practice before all courts of appeals and district courts of the
United States, insofar as provisions of the bill would apply to
practice before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit or before the District Court for the District of Columbia
(Conf. Rept. p. 28). H. R. 7461 subsequently introduced in the
84th Congress was identical with H. R. 828 except that it eliminated
the District of Columbia from its provisions. The proposed legisla­
tion would provide that with respect to a member of the bar of the
United States Supreme Court the sole requirement for admission
to practice before a court of appeals or district court of the United
States should be the filing of an application to practice with his         ~
statement that he is a member in good standing of that bar.
                                      43 

        The Committee pointed out that from the beginning of the
     Federal judicial system the several Federal courts have had power
     by rule of court to determine the qualifications of persons seeking
     admission to their bar. It was recalled that several years ago a
     committee of the Judicial Conference gave extensive consideration
     to the matter of uniform standards for admission to bars of the
     Federal courts and reported that it was not prepared to recommend
     uniform standards in this field. The Committee reported that it
     concurred in this view and believed that conditions in the various
     Federal judicial districts throughout the States were sufficiently
     diverse as to make it inadvisable to seek to impose uniform stand­
     ards for admission to the bar of each of them. Also, H. R. 7461
     would appear to deprive the lower courts of all control of the admis­
     sion to their bar of lawyers who had previously been admitted to
     the bar of the Supreme Court. The Committee recommended that
     the Judicial Conference disapprove the proposed legislation em­
     bodied in H. R. 828 and H. R. 7461 of the 84th Congress and the
     Conference adopted the recommendation.
        The Committee was asked by the Judicial Conference at the
     September 1955 session to consider a bill, H. R. 151 of the 84th
     Congress, disapproved by the Judicial Conference of the District
     of Columbia Circuit, relating to the practice of law in that circuit
     (Conf. Rept. p. 28). The proposed legislation which related only
     to the District of Columbia would appear to be designed to make
     criminal the practice of law by persons not admitted to the bar.
     However it would seem that the bill might be construed to author­
     ize a member of the bar of any court of record of any State, terri­
     tory, or possession to practice law in the District of Columbia.
     The Committee recommended that the judgment of the Judicial
     Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit disapproving the
     bill be followed, and the Conference adopted the recommendation.

     ASSIGNMENT OF RETIRED TERRITORIAL JUDGES TO ACTIVE DUTY

       The Judicial Council of the Third Circuit had submitted to the
     Committee a proposal that legislation be enacted to permit a judge
     of a territorial district court who has retired from office on salary
     under section 373 of Title 28, United States Code, to be designated
     and assigned, with his own consent, to perform judicial duty as a
f
     judge pro tempore in any such territorial court where his services
'~
     are needed. The Committee reported that it was of the opinion
     that such a provision for the employment of the services of a retired
                                       44
territorial judge who was willing to give them was in the public d
interest and recommended approval by the Conference of a bill ")il
drafted by the Committee to accomplish that object. The Con­
ference approved the recommendation and the draft of bill pre­
pared by the Committee, with an amendment that the retired
judge would be eligible for assignment only upon the filing of a
certificate that he was not engaged in the practice of law.
FURNISHING THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD TO JUDGES AND COURT
                                   LIBRARIES

   The Committee reported that it had considered a bill (R. R. 815,
84th Congress) which would provide for the supplying of the Con­
gressional Record, free of charge, to United States judges and to
the libraries of the United States courts of appeals and district
courts. The Committee was of the view that access to the Con­
gressional Record may be of value to some judges and that it may be
important to have it in court libraries. The Committee therefore
recommended that the Conference approve the proposed legislation
modified so as to provide that a copy of the daily Congressional
Record be provided to those judges who request it and that copies M..~
of the bound volumes of the Congressional Record be provided to '~IJ
the libraries of courts which request them. The recommendation
of the Committee was approved by the Conference.

   RECORD ON REVIEW OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

   The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
approval (Conf. Rept. Mar. 1955 Sess., p. 16) of proposed legisla­
tion (S. 2223 and R. R. 6682, 84th Congress) authorizing the
abbreviation of the record on the review or enforcement of orders
of administrative agencies by the courts of appeals and the review
or enforcement of such orders on the original papers and to make
uniform the law relating to the record on review or enforcement
of such orders, with the following amendment:
     In line 15, page 2, after "record." and before "The" insert the following
   additional sentence; "Such rules may authorize the agency, board, commis­
   sion or officer to file in the court a certified list of the materials compriSing
   the record and retain and hold for the court all such materials and transmit
   the same or any part thereof to the court, when and as required by It, at
   any time prior to the final determination of the proceeding."
  The Committee pointed out that this amendment would rec-                             ~;
ognize a procedure which has been adopted by a number of courts of
                                     45 

    appeals to avoid the unnecessary burden of transmitting from the
    agencies to the clerk's office a large volume of papers which actually
    may not need to be examined, by authorizing the filing of a mere
    list of the papers constituting the record, the actual papers to be
    forwarded to the appellate court only when called for.
       The Conference adopted the recommendation of the Committee
    and reaffirmed its approval of the proposed legislation with the
    above amendment.
         NOTICE OF ApPEALS OF CERTAIN INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS

      Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference
    reaffirmed its approval of the legislation embodied in S. 2128 and
    H. R. 6631 of the 84th Congress which would provide for reason­
    able notice (instead of a mandatory five days' notice as at present)
    to the agency of applications to the courts of appeals for inter­
    locutory relief against orders of the Civil Aeronautics Board, the
    Federal Communications Commission, the Secretary of Agricul­
    ture, the Federal Maritime Board, and the Atomic Energy Com­
    mission. (See Jud. Conf. Repts. March 1955 Sess., p. 17; March
    1956 Sess., p. 20.)
    ApPEALS FROM INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS OF THE DISTRICT COURTS

      Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
    reaffirmed its approval of the legislation embodied in H. R. 8331
    of the 84th Congress which would amend section 1292 of Title 28,
    United States Code, so as to authorize the court of appeals to permit
    appeals to be taken from interlocutory orders in civil actions when
    the district judge states in the order that it involves a controlling
    question of law as to which there is substantial ground for differ­
    ences of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may
    materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.
    (See Jud. Conf. Rept. March 1956 Sess., p. 19.)

                         DISTRICT COURT OF GUAM

       Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference re­
    affirmed its approval of the legislation embodied in H. R. 10630,
    84th Congress, which supersedes H. R. 9609, relating to the com­
    pensation and term of office of the judge of the district court of
r
    Guam, the jurisdiction of the court, the composition of the appel­
    late division of the court, and the temporary assignment of judges
                                46

CONSIDERATION OF MATTERS BY THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF
                            THE LAWS

   On motion of Chief Judge Biggs, the Committee on Revision of 

the Laws was authorized by the Conference to consider and report 

to the Conference on proposals pertinent to the sphere of the Com­

mittee whether or not they had previously been referred to the 

Committee by the Conference. 

            BAIL IN CERTAIN CRIMINAL CASES
   The Conference disapproved the proposed legislation contained 

in H. R. 26 of the 84th Congress which would restrict the right of 

a defendant to bail before conviction if the charges related to 

alleged offenses affecting the national security. 

   TENURE OF JUDGES IN HAWAII AND PUERTO RICO
   The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation that legislation
be enacted to provide that the United States district judges for the •
districts of Hawaii and Puerto Rico shall have the same tenure of
office and retirement rights as all other United States district
judges. This proposed legislation was introduced in the 84th Con­
gress as H. R. 8621. (See J ud. Conf. Repts. March 1953 Sess. p. 15;

         ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 

                          TO THE
         JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES




                      WASHINGTON, D. C. 

                      SEPTEMBER 19. 1956 

   This opportunity to meet with the distinguished members of
this Judicial Conference and to discuss with them the issues of cur­
rent interest to the Bench, the Bar, the people and the Department
of Justice, is very much appreciated.
   Through our continued joint concern over common problems and
our joint efforts in solving them, we will together have the satisfac­
tion of forwarding the great American traditions and ideals of
justice in our courts.
   1. Case Backlog and Delay.
   Delay in litigation continues to be the primary problem in the
administration of justice in most of our Federal and State courts.
We seek a solution to this problem which will wipe out the law's
delays without sacrifice of fundamental rights.
   There are no pat or easy answers to this problem. Recent experi­
ments in some districts for modernizing judicial machinery and
administration have paid handsome dividends. One case involving
the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New Y ork­
our largest and most congested court-will illustrate the point.
   In the fall of 1955 a committee of Federal district judges took
over control of the calendar. The jury and non-jury parts were
placed in charge of two of the judges. These judges required
attorneys in every case to appear and discuss these cases informally.
   In this frame of judicial interest, guidance and supervision, hun­
dreds of cases that should have been settled, were settled. If a case
was not ready for trial, it was removed from the calendar. Those
ready for trial were shifted to the ready day calendars, and the
attorneys instructed to be prepared to try them at short notice.
   The first call of the entire calendar was completed by the end of
January. In the next two months there was a second call of cases
adjourned for various reasons. By the end of Apri11956, this sys­
tem of special calendars produced the most amazing results. In
a period of merely seven months, a calendar load of 5,772 cases had
been reduced to 2,384, or a reduction of 60 percent, and further
reductions are anticipated in the future. However, even with
their present load, and working very hard as all our Federal judges
do-harder than is good for their health and the adequate consider­
ation of matters-it is not possible for them to handle the increas­
ing load of incoming cases unless Congress authorizes the appoint­
ment of additional jUdges.
                                 (51)
                                 52
   That the fault for these delays does not lie with our judges is      t1,~!i)
demonstrated by statistics. These show, not a decrease in output
by judges, but an increase in litigation that completely outpaces
the number of judges available to cope with it.
   Thus between 1941 and 1956, the number of cases filed annually
increased 62.2 percent, whereas the number of district judges in­
creased only 26.9 percent. In that period the district judges in­
creased the average number of civil cases terminated annually per
judgeship, 38.8 percent, and increased the average number of pri­
vate cases terminated annually per judgeship, 44.5 percent. But
even these marked increases in disposition of cases fell far short of
what was required to handle the burden of increased civil litigation.
   We know that relief will not come from any reduction in the
population. The contrary is the case. As Judge Biggs aptly de­
clared: "The popUlation is not expanding, it's exploding." In
addition, our expanding economy, tremendous increases in auto­
mobile and air travel, and many other factors are bound to be pro­
ductive of mounting litigation.
   You have requested, and I have strongly supported, your plea
for more judges. Favorable action in both the Senate and House          "I?
last year on the Omnibus Judgeship Bills almost assures favorable       ~~l
action early in the next Congress. But when we get down to it,
this is merely an emergency stop-gap measure. It does not suffice
for our fast growing country. We must set our sights on the long­
range problem of an effective and adequate system of justice in
the Federal courts. If we are not to be bogged down in the future
we must be ready with something more than patchwork plans now,
where it is always too little, too late.
   What we need in my opinion, if we are to avoid a real crisis in
the Federal court system, is a comprehensive study and report of
 our anticipated needs at least for the next 10 to 20 years.
   When Congress is fully apprised of the facts, it will not be re­
 luctant to act. Give the Congress documentary proof of the
 peoples' needs in the Federal courts and it will not fail to respond
 to them. And when the people learn in detail what the crying
 needs of the Federal judiciary are, it will go all-out to support
 worthy measures enacted by Congress to help the Courts discharge
 their public responsibility.
   2. The Attorney General's Conference on Court Congestion in          ~:

1956.                                                                   "
                                          53 

I""t,   With these objectives in mind, during May of this year I invited
\y"f to Washington leaders of the bench and bar to discuss the problem
     of court congestion and delay in litigation, and to plan its solution.
     Representatives of State and local bar associations, and other or­
     ganizations from all over the country participated actively in this
     conference. I t fulfilled our highest expectations. I think a course
     has been charted which will materially help provide the machinery
     to bring about needed reforms.
        A Steering Committee chaired by Judge Herbert F. Goodrich,
     of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, rendered a Report
     which represented the conclusions reached by the Conference.
        It was decided that the Conference would not undertake re­
     search but would serve solely in an advisory capacity. It will en­
     courage, on a nationwide basis, programs to help eliminate delays in
     the trial and decision of cases. It plans to coordinate, to the extent
     possible, by voluntary action, the various activities being under­
     taken by many organizations, groups and individuals in this field.
     In the forthcoming year the principal function of the Conference
     will be to receive and correlate information, and to discuss and
     report on various projects designed to improve the administration
 Q    of justice.
         Among other matters, areas of inquiry to be covered in the Con­
      ference study are:
           1. The need for ndequate judicial statistics in each state and their
         accurate appraisal;
           2. The flexibility of judicial systems, and the extent to which judges of
         one community whose workloads are light are permitted to serve in areas
         where calendars are heavy;
           3. The extent to which discovery procedures, pre-trial conferences and
         other pre-trial techniques are employed and their success in relieving court
         congestion j
           4. The procedures for handling court calendars so that the most efiicient
         use is made of judicial time, courtroom space and court ofiicera;
           5. The extent to which the progress of litigation must be controlled by
         the judge, and the extent to which cooperation by bench and bar can be
         made most effective;
           6. The professional responsibility of the bar in assisting to accomplish
         these objectives.
           It was recommended tha.t an Executive Committee should be
         formed including a chairman appointed by the Attorney General.
         This Executive Committee has been charged with the function of
    - carrying into effect the recommendations and conclusions of the
   ,..., conference; of preparing an agenda for further conferences; and
         soliciting the assistance of other individuals and organizations,
                                    54

both professional and lay, who may be likely to make helpful con- "", ','
tributions in the matter.                                         ~li;
   It is my pleasure to announce at this time the members of the
Executive Committee who have graciously agreed to serve. They
are:
   Mr. William P. Rogers, Chairman, Deputy Attorney General, representing
     the Department of Justice
   Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration
     of the JudIcial Conference of the United States
   Congressman Emanuel Celler, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the
     House of Representatives
   Senator James O. Eastland, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the
     Senate
   Chief Justice Edmund W. Flynn, Chairman of the Conference of Chief
     Justices
   Mr. Jenkins Lloyd Jones, President of the American Society of Newspaper
     Editors
   Governor Arthur B. Langlie, President of the Council of State Governments
   Mr. Arthur Littleton, Chairman of the National Conference of Bar Associa­
     tions
   Mr. David F. Maxwell, President of the American Bar Association
   Mr. Philip Mechem, President-Elect of the American Association of Law
     Schools
   Judge Arthur T. Vanderbilt, President of the Institute of Judicial Ad­
     ministration                                                              fi't)
   3. Other Aspects of Department Cooperation To Reduce Con- '
gestion in the Courts.
   The Department of Justice has been doing its share in other
respect-s to cut down court delays.
   As you know the Department is the Federal Court's best cus­
tomer. It is plaintiff in 27 percent and defendant in 7 percent of
all civil litigation in the District Courts. This alone amounts to
20,000 new cases each year. In addition, the Government prose­
cutes about 28,000 criminal cases annually. Excluding the Cus­
toms Court and Court of Claims, this means that the United States
is a party to approximately 50 percent of all the cases in the Federal
District Courts.
   Because of our great concern and responsibility in enforcing Fed­
eral laws, the Department has exerted every effort to cooperate
with the courts in clearing up case backlogs.
   I am proud of the remarkable results achieved by United States
Attorneys and their staffs for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956.
   As of June 30,1955, our caseload was 29,979 cases. As of June 30, ....
1956, our caseload was 24,253 cases. This was a reduction of 19.1              ,1,
                                     55 

     percent or 5,726 cases. It is by far the largest reduction in the
0;   pending caseload for the past 20 years.
        While we were reducing the caseload, we were increasing collec­
     tions for the United States Treasury. For the fiscal year 1956, our
     collections reached an all-time high of $42,034,788. This was an
     increase of 53.02 percent over fiscal year 1955, when $27,470,493
     was collected.
        You may be interested in one of the ways by which we were able
     to dispose of many of our cases.
        At the 1955 Conference of United States Attorneys, the latter
     were requested to contact Federal district judges and attempt to
     arrange special tax calendars wherever this was feasible. This
     was done in a number of districts with the kind cooperation of the
     judges sitting there. The results were fruitful. Over 600 civil tax
     cases were presented to the courts in the fiscal year ending June
     30, 1956. This was an increase of 183 trials or 44 percent over
     1955. With only a few exceptions, the dockets of civil tax cases
     are now current.
        On the basis of this experiment, it is suggested that this plan
     may be carried out successfully in other district courts as well, not
--.. only with tax cases, but in other kinds of cases where similar or
~'~ related problems are presented.
        4. Federal Youth Corrections Act.
        We are pleased once again to report the steady increase in the
     use which is being made by the courts of the provisions of the
     Youth Corrections Act. The Act has now been invoked in all but
     six of the Judicial Districts in which it is now operative. Between
     January 1954 and June 1956, a total of 819 young men and women
     were committed under sentence as youth offenders, and an addi­
     tional 59 youths were received for study and observation prior to
     sentence. In 1955, 30 percent of the offenders under the age
     of 22, exclusive of juveniles, received in Federal institutions were
     sentenced under the Youth Act, and in 1956, the percentage in­
     creased to slightly more than 36 percent.
        Continued progress has been made during the past year in the
     development of a sound yet flexible and experimental program of
     training and treatment for youth offenders at the institution at
     Ashland, Kentucky.
        To June 30, 1956, a total of 226 offenders had been released on
 - authorization of the Youth Division of the United States Board
 '-' of Parole. The rate of paroles each month is now rising rapidly
                                 56 

and it is anticipated that by the end of this year the number of
youths under supervision in the community will equal the number ~?
receiving treatment in the institution. Of the youths paroled 38 ' I
had violated the conditions of their release by June 30. We con­
tinue to have excellent cooperation from the United States Proba­
tion Service in release planning and supervision for the youth
group. We feel confident that through the combined resources of
both institutional and probation staffs we may look forward to
significant results from this fresh and intensified approach to the
treatment of this most challenging group of offenders.
   We have, of course, been particularly anxious to extend the oper­
ations of the Youth Act to the area of the United States beyond
the Mississippi River. This has been delayed, unfortunately, be­
cause the continuing high level of population of Bureau of Prisons
institutions posed serious difficulties in certifying the availability
of additional institutions for the youth program. The need for
additional institutions to implement the youth program was pre­
sented to Congress in 1955 and again in 1956. At its last session
Congress appropriated funds for the establishment of a new youth
camp in the West and we are now looking for a site suitable for
this unit. Congress also made funds available for the preparation ~~'
of plans and acquisition of sites for two additional institutions, one   i
of which will be a guidance center for the youth group. We will
have to return to Congress at its next session for the necessary
funds to construct these institutions and if they are appropriated
it will still require 2 or 3 years before the guidance center is ready
for occupancy.
   Despite the fact that no new institutional facility is yet available,
the Director of the Bureau of Prisons has infonned me that be­
cause of the importance of the youth program, he is taking emer­
gency measures to develop the institution at Englewood, Colorado,
as our second youth center. He expects to be in a position to certify
the availability of that institution within the next few weeks.
This will enable us to extend the program to the entire country.
   Another important development during the past year has been
the activiation of the Federal Advisory Corrections Council, which
you will recall was established by the Youth Corrections Act. The
Advisory Corrections Council, which numbers among its member­
ship Chief Judge Orie L. Phillips and United States District Court
Judges Albert V. Bryan and Luther W. Youngdahl, has been active iI,
since Dr. Hurst R. Anderson, President of American University, "
                                       57 

      was appointed chairman in May 1955. To date the Council has
("'" had three meetings. Following an organizational meeting in
..,,1 September 1955, the meeting in January 1956, was devoted largely
      to a review of legislation then before the Congress. The Council
      unanimously endorsed an administration proposal to strengthen
      and improve State and local programs t{) combat and control
      juvenile delinquency, In this connection it was urged that the
      States give particular attention to measures which would aid the
      States in developing their programs for the treatment and training
      of youthful offenders.
      5. Treatment of Adult Criminal Offenders.
            The challenge presented by youthful law violators is given added
         emphasis by the steady increases in the popUlation of Bureau of
         Prisons institutions over the past five years. On June 30, 1956,
         there were 20,374 prisoners confined in our institutions. The
         average popUlation of the 28 institutions reached 20,209, an all­
         time peak. Perhaps even more significant than the increase in
         number has been the marked change in the composition of the
         Federal prison population over the past 5 years. Federal prisoners,
         generally, are younger, are serving longer sentences, and have com­
,. _ mitted more serious offenses. This has resulted in dislocations in
. ., ,,. the distribution of the institutional population among the institu~
         tions. Thus, while a few of the minimum custody institutions are
         under capacity, the majority are seriously overcrowded.
            The enactment of the Uniform Narcotic Act of 1956, which pro­
         vides substantially higher criminal penalties for offenses involving
         importation and sale of narcotive drugs and denies persons con­
         victed of such crimes eligibility for probation and parole considera­
         tion, will serve further to swell the popUlations of overburdened
         institutions.
            We have recognized the vital importance of our continuing to
         expand our institutional system. This is essential not only to re­
         duce current crowding of our institutions, but we must also provide
         for a continuing increase in commitments as the general popUlation
         of the United States continues to grow. It is for this reason that we
         outlined to the last session of Congress the need for a broad pro­
         gram of future development of Federal penal and correctional in­
         stitutions. We are hopeful that there may be an orderly, system­
         atic development of our needed facilities in order that we may con­
    - tinue faithfully to execute the orders of the courts and protect the
   '- interests of society.
                                  58

   6. Uniform Sentencing.
   Before we leave the subject of the federal penal system, I should \')::,;
like briefly to discuss the question of sentencing persons convicted
for the same or similar crimes.
   In imposing a sentence it is recognized that a judge frequently
gives consideration, among other things, to the motivation of the
crime, the antecedents of the offender, the nature of the personality
of the accused, his past record, and many other social, human and
individual elements which may be inseparable from the cause of
the crime itself. It is indeed, as it should be, the modern trend to
fit the punishment to the criminal rather than to the crime.
   In those circumstances, however, where the apparent elements
back of a crime and a criminal are substantially alike, disparate
punishment creates misunderstanding and confusion in the public
mind. It presents a troublesome morale problem for prosecutors
and their assistants. It also engenders resentment among prisoners,
and makes for an undesirable morale problem within the prison.
   Those of us who have any experience with the courts know that
the duty of imposing sentence is often more difficult than the trial
itself. No one of us can minimize the anguish that goes into bal­
ancing the scales of justice so that each sentence will be just. Our An'
courts are properly concerned about safeguarding the public ~
against future crime. The sentence must be adequate to deter
other persons from similar wrongdoing. It must be such as will
prevent the hardened criminal from continuing to prey on society.
It must not be so severe as to deprive the young, the accidental
or unfortunate offenders of an opportunity to correct their way of
life. Margins of difference in sentences either because of different
defendants, different fact situations, or other differences, are to be
expected. But if the people are to continue to have faith in the
integrity of the judicial process, then at the very least a unified
sentencing philosophy must prevail in our courts.
   This perplexing problem will be under careful study in the De­
partment of Justice during the coming months.
   7. Tribute of Henry P. Chandler.
    Finally, on behalf of the Department of Justice, I would like
 to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to Henry P.
 Chandler. After 17 years as Director of the Administrative Office,
 United States Courts, Mr. Chandler plans to retire October 31,
 1956. We have long valued Mr. Chandler's friendship. He has t'
 won the esteem and respect of judges, court personnel, members of ,.
                                59 

Congress and the public at large. His notable service as a true and
devoted public servant will be missed by all of us. Under his able,
mature and conscientious leadership, the Administrative Office has
played an important role in promoting the proper administration
and efficiency of the Federal Courts. ""nen organized in 1939, this
Administrative Office of the Federal judicial system was a pioneer
in its field. It has now become a model for the States to follow.
Already New Jersey and New York have established similar offices
to improve the administration of their courts, and many other
States are making rapid progress in this direction.
   I know that I express the sentiments of many friends throughout
the country in wishing Mr. Chandler the greatest happiness in his
well-earned leisure years ahead.
