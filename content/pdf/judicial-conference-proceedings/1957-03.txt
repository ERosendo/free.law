         REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 The Attorney General presented a report to the Conference
which appears in the appendix.

      ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS RECOMMENDED
   The Conference discussed the state of the business of the federal
courts and reviewed the need for additional judicial assistance
recommended by the Committee on Court Administration and
the Committee on Judicial Statistics. The Conference was in­
formed that the temporary judgeship in the Middle District of
Tennessee, which the Conference had recommended be made per­
manent (Cf. Rpt., Sept. Sess., 1956, p. 6), had expired with the
death of the chief judge of the district in January. The Com­
mittee on Court Administration reported that it had considered
the proposals for additional judgeships in Tennessee and was of
the view that two additional judgeships were needed in the State,
one for the Eastern District as previously recommended by the
                                                                       o
Conference (Cf. Rpt., Sept. Sess., 1956, p. 5) and one for the
Western District.
   The Conference received the report of the Committee on Court
Administration and after a careful consideration of the views of
its members individually with regard to conditions in their re­
spective circuits recommended the creation of the following judge­
ships not heretofore recommended:
     1 additional circuit judgeship for the Second Circuit.
     1 additional district judgeship for the District of New Jersey.
     1 additional district judgeship for the Western District of
       Pennsylvania.
     1 additional district judgeship for the Western District of
       Tennessee.
     1 additional district judgeship for the Northern District of
       Illinois.
   The Conference further approved a recommendation of the Com­
mittee on Court Administration that the proviso making the sec­
ond judgeship in the Middle District of Georgia temporary, should
be repealed.                                                            -

    matter it was referred to the Committee on Court Administration
    for further study in the light of Judge Chambers' statement.
      The Conference approved the recommendation of the Commit­
    tee on Court Administration that the temporary judgeship now
    existing in the District of Nevada not be made permanent at this
    time.
            REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON COURT 

                           ADMINISTRATION 

      Chief Judge Biggs, Chairman of the Committee on Court Ad­
    ministration, presented the report of the Committee.
                      EXAMINATION OF COURT OFFICES

          The Department of Justice by a letter addressed to the Chief
       Justice of the United States by the Attorney General, dated Feb­
       ruary 7, 1957, stated that the Department of Justice wishes to
       discontinue at the earliest possible date the making of field ex­
       aminations of court offices. The present practice is for the field
       examiners of the Department of Justice to make examinations of
       the offices of the clerks of court, referees in bankruptcy, probation
       officers, United States commissioners, and court reporters at the
       same time that they make examinations in the same district of
       the offices of the marshals and administrative aspects of the offices
       of the United States Attorneys. On several occasions the Judicial
       Conference has gone on record by resolution making clear its po­
       sition that the examining function is within the purview of the
       Administrative Office of the United States Courts. (Cf. Rpts.,
       Jan. 1940, p. 2; Jan. 1941, p. 7; Sept. 1944, pp. 11, 12). It is
       estimated that appropriations in the amount of $75,000 per year
       will be required for the Administrative Office to assume this
       function.
          The Committee recommended to the Judicial Conference that
       the function of examining judicial offices be carried on by the
       Administrative Office, this ,,,ork to commence as soon as possible
       on or after July 1, 1957 and that the Department of Justice be
       requested to continue the examinations until that date. The
       recommendation was approved by the Conference and the Ad­
       ministrative Office was granted authority to join with the Depart­
       ment of Justice in asking Congress to transfer $75,000 from the
""'" 	 Department's estimates to the estimate of the Administrative
       Office in the 1958 Appropriation Act for this purpose.

       REPORTS BY PRESIDING JUDGES OF COURTS OF ApPEALS

  The Judicial Conference at its September 1956 session (Cf. Rpt.,
p. 16) referred to the Committee on Court Administration the
recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit
that "by rule or legislation, presiding judges of divisions or in
bane hearings of the Courts of Appeals be required to make quar­
terly reports of the pendency of their submitted cases, such as are
now required of the district judges". Chief Judge Biggs reported
the view of the Committee that it would be desirable to require
such reports and submitted for the consideration of the Conference
a form letter requesting such information. On the motion of
Judge Whitaker the recommendation of the Committee and the
form letter were amended to include the Court of Claims.
   After a full discussion the Conference resolved that the presid­
ing judges of panels or divisions of the Courts of Appeals and of
courts sitting in bane and of the Court of Claims make quarterly
reports of cases under submission for more than three months,
summaries of such reports to be given to all the judges of the court
and to the Judicial Conference of the United States, and approved
the following form of request:
    To the Presiding .Judges of Panels or Divisions of the Courts of Appeals
    and of Courts Sitting In Banc and of the Court of Claims Who Have Pre­
                                                                                    o
    sided in Cases Reported by the Clerk as Under Submission More Tban
    Three Months on ___________________________________________________ :
  DEAR JUDGE: The clerk of your court has reported the following case or
cases, which were heard by a panel over which you presided, as under submis­
sion more than 3 months on ______________________________ :
  The Judicial Conference of the United States at its meeting on March 14 and
15, 1957 adopted a resolution requiring the presiding judges of panels or di­
visions of the Courts of Appeals and of courts sitting in banc and of the Court
of Claims to make quarterly reports of the pendency of cases under submission
more than three months, summaries of sueh reports to be given to all the judges
of the court and to the .Judicial Conference. Therefore, I request that you
furnish me the following information concerning the cases listed above:
       (1) The date of submission of the case.
       (2) The names of the judges on the panel.
       (3) Any explanatory reason you wish to give as to why the case has
     not been decided, or its present status.
  If there are any reasons accountable for delay in the disposition of particular
cases such as that they are awaiting the decision of another case, that post­
ponement of decision has been made at the request af the parties, or that the
judges are awaiting supplementary briefs, I shall be glad to have that
information.
       Yours sincerely,
                                     7

    DISAPPROVAL OF A UNITED STATES COURT OF ApPEALS FOR PATENTS

      The Committee reported that it had considered S. 3744 of the
    84th Congress, referred to it by the Conference at its September,
    1956 Session (Cf. Rpt., p. 17) to establish a United States Court
    of Appeals for Patents, and for other purposes. The Committee
    unanimously recommended to the Conference that it disapprove
    the proposed legislation. The Conference approved the recom­
    mendation of the Committee.
          DELAYS IN THE DISPOSITION OF CRIMINAL ApPEALS

      The matter of securing a more prompt disposition of criminal
    appeals has been under consideration by the Committee and as
    a means of expediting such appeals, the Committee presented a
    resolution concerning the appendix rule and the original records
    rule and the use of typewritten briefs and appendices in these
    cases. The Committee was of the view that the matter was one
    of great importance and that steps should be taken by all the
    courts of appeals to shorten the disposition of criminal appeals.
      The Conference after a full discussion resolved that each court
    of appeals consider (1) adopting the appendix rule, (2) adopting
    the original records rule, (3) making a more liberal use of type­
    written briefs and appendices, and (4) expediting criminal appeals
    on its own motion.

           MAINTENANCE ALWWANCE FOR JUDGES TRAVELING
                          ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS

       The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference the
    bills, S. 1340 and H. R. 3369, introduced in the 85th Congress
    which would increase the maximum allowance for maintenance
    for judges traveling on official business from $15 to $25 per day.
    The Committee reco:mrnended to the Judicial Conference that the
    maximum maintenance allowance for judges be increased from
    $15 a day to $25 a day and that H. R. 3369 and S. 1340 be ap­
    proved. The Conference adopted the recommendation of the
    Committee.
                    ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE SALARIES

       The Judicial Conference at its September 1956 Session (Cf. Rpt.,

-   p. 18) recommended that the salary of the Director of the Admin­
    istrative Office be placed at $22,500 a year, the sarne as that of a
                                  8

district judge. This recommendation ,\-vas a renewal of the COll­
ference's prior recommendation made at its March 1955 session ~
(Cf. Rpt., p. 10). The Conference also recommended that the ''rJI
salary of the Assistant Director of the Administrative Office be
put at $20,000 per year (Cf. Rpt., Mar. Sess., 1955, p. 10), and that
the salaries of the heads of the four divisions of the Administra­
tive Office be put at $18,500 a year (Cf. Rpt., Mar. Sess., 1955,
p.10).
   The salary of the Director has presently been fixed by Congress
in the Federal Executive Pay Act of 1956, Public Law 854, 84th
Congress, approved July 31, 1956, at $20,000 and the salary of the
Assistant Director has been fixed at $17,500. Provisions for the
salaries of the heads of the divisions were included in the Senate
bill at grade GS-18, salary $16,000, but were excluded from the
bill as finally enacted.
   The Committee therefore unanimously resolved to recommend
to the Judicial Conference that it renew its recommendation that
the salary of the Director be placed at $22,500, the salary of the
Assistant Director at $20,000 and that the Conference now rec­
ommend that the salaries of the heads of t,he four divisions be fixed
at grade GS-18 or $16,000. The Conference approved the recom­
mendation.                                                               0
ApPOINTMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL JUDGE WHEN AN INCUMBENT
                      JUDGE REACHES AGE      70

   The Committee reported that it gave careful consideration to
the proposal contained in the President's Budget message that
the President be authorized to appoint by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate upon certification by the Judicial Confer­
ence of the need therefor, an additional judge when an incumbent
judge reaches 70, is eligible to retire and fails to do so, no vacancy
to be created when the judge who had reached age 70 dies, resigns
or retires. The Conference was advised that a bill, H. R. 3392,
containing the recommendation of the President had been intro­
duced in the House of Representatives.
   The Conference referred the proposal contained in the Presiden­
tial budget message and H. R. 3392 to the Committee to consider
the matter further and to report thereon at a future session of the
Judicial Conference.

             DIVERSITY OF CI'l'IZENSHIP'   J URISDIC'IION

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Committee had considered
at length various proposals for restricting or modifying the present
diversity jurisdiction of the United States Courts. The Commit­
tee found that the situation in respect to diversity jurisdiction is
an extremely complex one and was not prepared to deal at length
with the subject until further statistics have been procured from
the Administrative Office and the matter has been considered
further.
   Previously the Committee had recommended that the jurisdic­
tional amount be placed at $15,000 exclusive of interest and costs,
but it was now of the view that it should modify its former recom­
mendation and adhere to that expressed by the Committee on
Jurisdiction and Venue of which Chief Judge Parker was chairman.
Accordingly it unanimously resolved that the Committee recom­
mend to the Judicial Conference that the jurisdictional amount in
diversity cases be increased to $10,000 exclusive of interest and
costs and that every effort be made to procure the enactment of
such legislation by the present Congress.
   The Committee also was of the view that the recommendation
made to the Conference by the Committee on Jurisdiction and
Venue, that a corporation be deemed to be a citizen not only of
the State of its incorporation but also of the State in which it has
its principal place of business should be renewed at the present
Congress.
   These recommendations were adopted by the Conference and
the Committee was authorized to continue its study of jurisdiction
in diversity of citizenship cases.
     THE CREATION OF NEW DISTRICTS AND NEW DIVISIONS

  The Committee reported that there are presently pending in
Congress various bills to create three new districts and one bill to
create a new division within an existing district. The bills, H. R.
1930 and H. R. 3085, would create a llew district within the State
of Florida; the bill, H. R. 1928, would create a new district within
the State of Colorado; and the bills, H. R. 229, H. R. 2523, H. R.
2532, H. R. 4827, and S. 604, would provide for a new district in the
State of California. The Committee recommended to the Judicial
Conference that it express disapproval of these bills. The recom­
mendation of the Committee was approved by the Conference.
                                     10

  The Committee also recommended to the Judicial Conference
that it disapprove S. 548 and H. J. Res. 189 which would create a                ~
new division consisting of Alameda and Contra Costa counties in                  ~
the Northern District of California and which would also provide
that court be held at Oakland. The Conference approved the
recommendation of the Committee.
       SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS
  Chief Judge Biggs, chairman of the Committee on Supporting
Personnel of the Courts, presented the report of the Committee to
the Conference.
              QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROBATION Ol<'l<'ICERS

  At its September Session, 1956) the Judicial Conference of the
United States renewed its recommendation first made a year pre­
vious that appropriate legislation be enacted to empower the Ju­
dicial Conference to promulgate minimum standards which must .
be met by all probation officers to be appointed in the future (Cf.
Rpt., Sept. Sess. 1956, p. 16; Sept. Sess. 1955, p. 11).
   On the recommendation of the Committee on Supporting Per­
sonnel the Judicial Conference approved the following draft of a                 0
bill to authorize the Judicial Conference of the United States to
promulgate minimum standards of qualifications for probation
officers:
A BILL To authorize the Judicial Conference of the United States to promulgate
         minimum standards of qualifications for probation otllcers.

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
     of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
     the first paragraph of section 3654 of Title 18, United States
     Code, is amended to read as follows:
        "Any court having original jurisdiction to try offenses
     against the United States may appoint one or more suitable
     persons to serve as probation officers within the jurisdiction
     and under the direction of the court making such appoint­
     ment. The Judicial Conference of the United States is au­
     thorized to promulgate minimum standards of qualifications
     for probation officers and no salaried probation officer shall
     be appointed who does not fulfill such standards.
        "Section 2. This act shall not be applicable to probation                ,..-...
     officers appointed before the date of its enaetment."                        __

                     PERSONNEL OF 'l'HE COURT OF CLAIMS

          The Judicial Conference at its September 1956 session author­
--     ized the Committee on Supporting Persollnel to consider the
       grades and salaries of the supporting personnel of the Court of
       Claims. The Committee resolved that the Administrative Office
       should make a comparison of the grades and sala.ries of the sup­
       porting personnel of the Court of Claims with those of the sup­
       porting personnel of the other l!llited States Courts and report
        the same to the Committee in order that it may have the data
       necessary to make the study authorized. The Conference ap­
        proved this resolution.
                        NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS

               Chief Judge Biggs advised the Conference that the Acting Di­
            rector of the Administrative Office had reported to the Committee
            on Supporting Personnel that Judge Robert E. Thomason of the
            Western District of Texas deemed it desirable that a National Park
            Commissioner be appointed for Big Bend National Park to the end
            that the administration of justice in Big Bend National Park might
            be expedited. The Committee voted to recommend the appoint­
  ,........ ment of such a commissioner at a salary of $4,300 a year. How­

.. ,.; 	 ever, the Committee was of the view that it may be very difficult
            to get an adequately trained person possessing the responsibility
             to perform the duties of a commissioner at this salary in view of
            the isolation of Big Bend National Park and therefore further
             recommended to the Conference that a maximum salary of $4,840
             be approved by the Conference, if necessary. The recommenda­
             tion was approved by the Conference.
                The Committee also resolved that a study be made by the Ad­
             ministrative Office of the salaries of the National Park Conunis­
             sioners to ascertain whether or not their present salaries reflect
             the equivalent of the various salary increases granted by Congress
             to other Federal employees during the past few years and to report
             thereon to the Committee on Supporting Personnel. The Con­
             ference authorized this study.

                          SECRETARIES AND LAW CLERKS

          The Conference at its :.'\iarch, 1956 session (Cf. Rpt., p. 8) upon
        the recommendation of the Committee instructed the Director of
 -      the Administrative Office that approval may be given to the em­
 \W'         42300:3-57--3
                                 12 

ployment of a secretary-law clerk and a law clerk, or a secretary­
law clerk and a secretary by an individual judge who desires such
a combination of employees. Circuit Judge Healy of the Ninth
Circuit thereupon reclassified his secretary as a secretary-law clerk
at the increased salary. This was denied by the Acting Director
on the ground that the secretary had not been admitted to the
bar, a requirement he deemed essential under the pertinent classi­
fication. The issue was then certified to the Judicial Council of
the Ninth Circuit in accordance with the provisions of the Judi­
ciary Appropriation Act of 1956. The Council approved the re­
classification made by Judge Healy and the Acting Director com­
plied. Later Circuit Judge Pope of the Ninth Circuit requested
that his secretary also be reclassified as a secretary-law clerk, but
with the consent of Judge Pope action on this request was delay~d.
   The Committee was unanimously of the view that the action of
the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit in approving the reclas­
sification of Judge Healy's secretary as a secretary-law clerk finds
no support in the standards approved by the Judicial Conference,
since she has not been admitted to the bar of the highest court of
the state or to the bar of a United States District Court, require­
ments imposed by the standards fixed for secretary-law clerks.
The Committee reported that because of the action of the Judicial
Council of the Ninth Circuit in approving this reclassification it
                                                                        o
 was of the view that the resolution recommended by it and adopted
by the Judicial Conference is inadequate for the protection of the
 classification syst-em for secretaries and law clerks established by
 the Conference in that the Conference, although having ultimat-e
 responsibility for establishing the classifications, has no ultimate
 authority for determining the correctness of individual classifica­
 tions made thereunder.
    The Conference, after full discussion, adopted the following res­
 olution recommended by the Committee:
       Resolved, That the resolution adopted by the Judicial Con­
     ference at its special session on March 13-14, 1956 with re­
     spect to the matter of fixing the compensation of secretaries
     and law clerks of circuit and district judges is amended by
     inserting therein immediately after the words "subject to
     review by the Judicial Council of the Circuit if requested by
     the Director" the following additional words "and to further
     review by the Judicial Conference of the United States if
     requested by either the appointing judge or the Director."
                                         13
            Upon the recommendation of the Committee the Judicial Con­


-
         ference further instructed the Director that if and when authority
         is given to the amendment of the present recommendation of the
         Conference and the elimination from the Appropriation Act of the
         present restrictive language, he should bring the question of the
         classification of the secretaries of Judges Healy and Pope to the
         Conference for review.

            1. The Conference referred to the Committee the question of
         what special clerical assistance may be necessary in the courts of
         appeals for the handling of petitions in forma pauperis and re­
         quests for the appointment of counsel following the decision of
         the Supreme Court in the case of John.son v. United State.s, de­
         cided March 4,1957,352 U. S. 565.
            2. At the request of Chief Judge Biggs the Committee on Sup­
         porting Personnel was authorized to consider again the classifica­
         tion of law clerks.

.....,               BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
.-I         Circuit Judge Phillips, chairman of the Committee on Bank­
         ruptcy Administration, reported that the Committee had met and
         considered the recommendations contained in the report of the
         Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office which was ap­
         proved by the Acting Director on February 12, 1957, relating to
         the positions of referees in bankruptcy to become vacant by ex­
         piration of term on June 30, 1957, unless a later expiration date
         is noted, and changes in salaries and arrangements.
            The report of February 12, 1957 was submitted by the Acting
         Director to the members of the Judicial Conference and to the
         Judicial Councils and the district judges of the circuits and dis­
         tricts concerned, with the request that the district judges advise
         the Judicial Councils of their respective circuits of their views
         in respect to the recommendations for their districts, and that the
         chief judges of the circuits in turn inform the Administrative
         Office of the views of the Judicial Councils of their circuits. The
         Acting Director's report together with the views expressed by the
         district judges and the circuit councils was considered by the Com­
 "...,   mittee. The Conference had before it the Committee's report

                                                        14 

as well as the recommendations of the Acting Director, the dis­
trict judges and the circuit councils.                                                                                          ~
   Upon the recommendation of the Committee the Conference                                                                      ,.;

  District oj 11lontana.-The Acting Director recommended that the position at
Butte be continued at the present salary of $3,OllO a year for a term of six ;rears
beginning' July 5, IH57. The District Court recommended an inerease from
$3,000 to $3,500 a year for the referee at Butte, amI also for the referee at
Great Falls. The Circuit COllncil and the Bankruptcy Committee appl'oYed the
recommendations of the Ading Director which recommendation was appl'oYed
Uy the Conference.

  The Committee recommended that the Administrative Office
be authorized to seek such additional appropriation for the fiscal
year 1958 for referees' salaries as may be necessary to carry out
the changes in salaries and arrangements for referees approved by
                                     17 

     the Conference.   The Conference concurred in this recommen­

-    dation.
                    SEC'l'ION 60 AND RELATED SECTIOXS

       The Committee reported that a bill, H. R. 5195 amending cer­
     tain sections of the Bankruptcy Act had been introduced recently
     in Congress but that the Committee had not had an opportunity
     fully to study the bill and the data furnished by the National
     Bankruptcy Conference supporting it. The Committee recom­
     mended that its Subcommittee studying these proposals be au­
     thorized to continue its study and report to the full Committee.
     The Conference approved this recommendation.

       SepPLEME~TAL ApPROPRIA'l'IOX Fon REFEHEES' IDXPEKSES FOR
                                    1957
       The Committee reported that because of the great increase in
     the number of bankruptcy cases filed during the first 6 months of
     the current fiscal year it became necessary to request a supple­
     mental appropriation in the amount of $79,900. This supplemen­
     tal estimate was approved by the Judicial Conference by a mail
-.   vote and the Committee recommended that the Judicial Con­
.,   ference now formally approve this action. The Conference ap­
     proved the recommendation.

       SUPPLEMENTAl; ApPROPRIATIOX FOR REFEREES' EXPENSES FOH
                                     1958
        The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference that
     the appropriation for referees' expenses for the fiscal year 1958 was
     designed to handle a volume of 74,000 new cases and pointed out
     that in view of the sustained increase in the number of new cases
     filed during the first 8 months of the current fiscal year, far
     more than 74,000 cases will be filed in the fiscal year 1958. The
     Administrative Office estimated that 82,000 cases will be filed in
     1958 which represents an increase of 10,000 cases over the estimate
     of 72,000 for 1957. Should the estimate of 82,000 cases for 1958
     be confirmed by the filings in the next few months, the Adminis­
     trative Office requested that authorization be given to seek such
     additional or supplemental appropriation for referees' expenses as
     may be needed for the fiscal year 1958.

-        The Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference au­
     thorize the Administrative Office to seek such additional appro­
                                18 

priation as may be necessary for referees' expenses for 1958 either
by a supplemental appropriation or by such other means as may          ,
be available, the amount of such request to be approvd by the chair­
man of the Bankruptcy Committee and submitted to the members
of the Judicial Conference by a mail vote for approval. The rec­
ommendation of the Committee was approved by the Conference.

                      LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

   The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference a
bill (R. R. 106) to amend Sections 2a, 11 and 14c of the Bank­
ruptcy Act so as to give the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to de­
termine the dischargeability or nondischargeability of provable
debts. An identical bill (R. R. 11543, 84th Congress) was ap­
proved in principle by the Conference at its September 1956
seSSIon.
   The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
previous approval with the suggestion that the language of Sec­
tion 14c (3) of the Bankruptcy Act which was removed by Section
3 of R. R. 106, be inserted in Section 17a of the Bankruptcy Act.
This change would have the effect of removing from Section
14c (3), as a ground for a complete denial of a discharge, the ob-     ~
taining of money or property on credit or the obtaining of an          ..
extension or renewal of credit by making or publishing or causing
to be made or published in any manner whatsoever a materially
false statement in writing respecting the fmancial condition of the
debtor and inserting similar language in Section 17a as a ground
for nondischargeability of a particular debt. The Conference ap­
proved this recommendation.
   The Committee also brought to the attention of the Confer~nce
R. R. 5811 to amend subsection b of Section 14 and clause 2 of
subdivision b of Section 58 of the Bankruptcy Act so as to permit
the 30 day notice of the last day fixed by the court for the filing
of objections to the discharge of the bankrupt to be combined with
the 10 day notice of the first meeting of creditors. This bill is
identical with R. R. 6251 and S. 1997 introduced in the 84th Con­
gress. Identical bills to carry out the objectives of R. R. 5811
have been introduced in several previous Congresses and have been
 approved by the Judicial Conference on each occasion.
   The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
 approval of this legislation. The Conference approved the                 ""
 recommendation.
      PROPOSAL TO AMEND GENERAL ORDER 17 (1) OF THE SUPREME
                             COURT

       The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference a
    proposal to amend General Order 17 (1) so as to relieve the trustee
    in bankruptcy of the duty of mailing to the Commissioner of In~
    ternal Revenue at Washington, D. C., notice of the bankrupt's
    adjudication. The proposal arises from the amendment of Sec­
    tion 58e of the Bankruptcy Act, Public Law 933, of the 84th Con­
    gress, which authorized the discontinuance of the mailing of certain
    notices of adjudication to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
    and the Comptroller General. The Internal Revenue Service
    desires also to be relieved of the labor of handling and process­
    ing the trustee's notice of adjudication now required to be mailed
    by the trustee in bankruptcy pursuant to General Order 17 (1) for
    the reason that such a notice is now being mailed to the district
    Director of the Internal Revenue Service in which the bankruptcy
    proceeding arises and is processed by him.
       At the September 1956 meeting of the Conference the Commit­
    tee recommended and the Conference approved the amendment of
    General Order 17 (1) so as to read as follows:
           "The trustee shall, immediately upon entering upon his du­
        ties, prepare a complete inventory of all of the property of
        the bankrupt or debtor that comes into his possession."
      Later the National Bankruptcy Conference suggested that there
    be added to the end of General Order 17 (1) as above amended,
    the following words:
          "unless prior thereto, a receiver or other officer has prepared
        such inventory."
       The views of the Bankruptcy Committee and the Conference
    with regard to the amendment proposed by the National Bank­
    ruptcy Conference were requested by the Chief Justice.
       The Bankruptcy Committee approved the amendment proposed
    by the National Bankruptcy Conference with the suggestion that
    the word "an" be inserted between the words "such" and "inven­
    tory" so that General Order 17 (1) as amended would read as
    follows:
           "The trustee shall, immediately upon entering upon his du­

-       ties, prepare a complete inventory of all of the property of
                                20 


    the bankrupt or debtor that comes into his possession unless,
    prior thereto, a receiver or other officer has prepared such an    Af.
    inventory."                                                        "
  The Conference approved this proposed amendment.

PAYMENT OF REFEHEES' TRAVEl, AND SUBSISTENCE EXPENSES TO
                     ANNUAL CONFERENCES

  The Bankruptcy Committee brought to the attention of the
Conference a request from the National Association of Referees in
Bankruptcy that provision be made for the payment of the ref­
erees' travel and subsistence expenses to their annual conferences.
It was pointed out that under existing law the payment of such
expenses could only be authorized by the Administrative Office
for attendance at official conferences. The Committee was of the
view that no authorization for such expenditures should be made
by the Administrative Office unless a basic act providing for such
expenditures is enacted by Congress and with respect to the ad­
visability of such act, the Committee recommended that the Con­
ference take no action at this time. The Conference concurred
in this recommendation.

PURCHASE AND INs'rALLATION OF      AIR CONDITIONING UNITS FOR          0
    REFEREES' OFFICES FROM THE REFEREES' EXPENSE FCND

   In the general court appropriation for 1958, a request was made
in the amount of $1,500,000 for air conditioning court quarters
in Federal buildings where complete air conditioning of the build­
ing is not contemplated. The general request included a number
of referees' offices and at the hearings before the House Appro­
priations Committee inquiry was made as to whether an appro­
priation for this purpose might properly be made under the pro­
visions of Section 62a (2) of the Bankruptcy Act which provides
for the payment of actual and necessary office and other expenses
of the referees when authorized and approved by the Director for
the efficient and economical operation of their offices including
mechanical equipment and devices.
   The Committee was of the view that the purchase of air con­
ditioning equipment for referees' offices in Federal buildings would
be an appropriate expenditure from the referees' expense fund
and recommended that the Conference authorize the Administra­
tive Office to take appropriate steps to have made available suffi-
                                   41

    cient funds from the referees' expense fund to carry out the air
    conditioning project heretofore recommended for referees' offices
    in Federal buildings where the building itself is not to be air
    conditioned. The Conference approved this recommendation.
      STUDY OF COSTS OF ADMINISTRATION IN BANKRUPTCY CASES

       The Committee reported that pursuant to the previous au­
    thorization of the Judicial Conference the Bankruptcy Division
    of the Administrative Office reported that additional cost studies
    for the year 1956 were being made and that the same would be
    brought to the attention of the courts where the costs of admin­
    istration have recurrently exceeded the national average. The
    Administrative Office reported that substantial progress toward
    reducing the cost of administration had been made in several
    districts.
       The Committee recommended that the cost studies be con­
    tinued in accordance with the previous authorization of the Ju­
    dicial Conference. The Conference approved this recommenda­
    tion.

-      COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                   CRIMINAL LAW
      Chief Judge Parker, chairman of the Committee on the Ad­
    ministration of the Criminal Law, presented the report of the
    Committee.
                     ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES

      Chief Judge Parker reported that the proposal for the review of
    sentences in criminal cases by the courts of appeals introduced
    in the 84th Congress and presently contained in the bill, H. R.
    270 of the 85th Congress, had been circulated among the judges
    under the "Phillips Plan," as authorized by the Conference at its
    September, 1956 session (Cf. Rpt., p. 33), and will be reported
    on by the Committee at the next session of the Conference.
    PAYMENT     OF    COMPENSATION      TO   COUNSEL   ApPOINTED    TO
              REPRESENT POOR PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME

      The Judicial Conference at its September, 1956 session (Cf.
    Rpt., p. 34) renewed its recommendation that legislation be
    enacted with respect to providing public defenders in the federal
_   courts or authorizing payment of compensation to counsel ap­
                                22 

pointed by the courts to represent indigent defendants accused
of crime. This proposal is contained in a bill, H. R. 108, intro­
duced in the 85th Congress. The Committee recommended that             ~ 

Congress be urged to enact this legislation and the Conference
approved the recommendation.
     ApPEALS BY THE UNITED STATES IN CRIMINAL CASES

  The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
recommendation of legislation to amend Section 3731 of Title 18,
United States Code, so as to provide for an appeal by the United
States from an adverse decision on a motion to suppress evidence.
(See Cf. Rpt., Sept. Sess. 1956, p. 35). This proposal is contained
in the bill H. R. 263 of the 85th Congress. The Conference re­
newed its recommendation concerning this proposal.

                         HABEAS CORPUS

  The Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference
again approve the bill heretofore endorsed by the Conference in
reference to applications for writs of habeas corpus by persons in
custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court. (See Cf. Rpt.,
Sept. Sess., 1955, p. 23; Mar. Sess., 1956, p. 17.) After a full
discussion the Conference voted to reaffirm its recommendation
of this proposal.
                                                                       o
COMMITTEE ON THE RULES OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

   The Committee renewed its previous recommendation (Cf. Rpt.,
Sept. Sess., 1956, p. 35) that the Conference recommend to the
Supreme Court that the Court revive, reconstitute and consolidate
its committees on the civil and criminal rules. After a full dis­
cussion the Conference authorized a committee to be appointed to
study (1) whether there should be a standing committee on the
rules of civil and criminal procedure and (2) whether there should
be a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States
to recommend changes in the rules.
   The Chief Justice was authorized, if he shall see fit, to appoint
a committee of this Conference to report concerning uniform rules
for appeals from the decisions of the Tax Court of the United
States.

-      Chief Judge Parker reported that the Committee had under 	
    consideration the recommendations of the Judicial Conference of
    the Ninth Circuit referred to it by the Conference at its last ses­
                                                                            1

    defined and that the probation law be changed to permit the dis­
    missal of an indictment after the successful completion of a term
                                                                            I

        TIME SPENT BY DEFENDANTS IN CONFINEMENT PRIOR TO
                                                                            I
                               SENTENCING

      The National Legal Aid Association by resolution presented to 

    the Judicial Conference had urged the giving of credit for the time 

    spent in jail prior to sentence by defendants in cases where such 

    defendants are sentenced to a term of imprisonment. It was the 

    informal opinion of the members of the Committee that most 

    sentencing judges now consider the time a prisoner has spent in 

    jail prior to sentence in determining the length of sentence to be 

    pronounced. The Committee has asked the Administrative Office 

    to collect information from the judges on this subject. 


    INCREASED PUNISHMENT FOR FOURTH CONVICTION OF A FELONY

      Chief Judge Parker reported that a bill, S. 543, introduced in 

    the 85th Congress, proposes to amend Section 3575 of Title 18, 

    United States Code, and provide that upon a fourth or subsequent 

    conviction of a felony the defendant be sentenced for a minimum 

    term of fifteen years and a maximum term of life. No release on 

    parole would be allowed until the minimum term of fifteen years 

    was served. The Committee unanimously recommended to the 

    Judicial Conference the disapproval of this legislation embodying 

    mandatory sentences. The Conference approved this recom­

    mendation. 

      The Committee further reported that the subject of the dis­

    parity of sentences was under study by the Committee and will 

    be reported on at a later date.

      THE STUDY OF PRE-TRIAL PROCEDURE IN 

               PROTRACTED CASES 

   Circuit Judge Alfred P. Murrah on behalf of the group of judges
appointed by the Chief Justice to make a study of the problems in
the pre-trial of protracted cases reported that considerable prog­
ress had been made and that he would communicate with the Chief
Judge of each circuit concerning the work of the study group.

           THE COURT REPORTING SYSTE;\1
  The Acting Director reported to the Conference that he was of
the view that a resurvey of the salaries of Court Reporters should
be undertaken at this time. The Conference was of the view that
the Administrative Office has authority to make such a survey un­
der the 1952 resolution of the Conference. (See Cf. Rpt., Mar.
Sess., 1952, p. 27).
  The following resolution of the Judicial Council of the Ninth
Circuit was referred to the Judicial Conference:
    Resolved, That this Council recommend to the Judicial Con­
    ference of the United States and to Congress that the legis­
    lation which permits certain government employees in Alaska
    to receive a 25 percent increase or differential in salaries due
    to the higher cost of living in Alaska, be extended to the Court
    Reporters there employed.
  The Conference was informed that a bill, H. R. 5801, to provide
cost-of-living allowances to judicial employees stationed outside
the continental United States or in Alaska had been introduced in
the Congress. The Conference recommended the enactment of
H. R. 5801.

PERMANENT QUARTERS FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE
                 OFFICE
   The Administrative Office reported that a sum had been in­
cluded in the appropriation estimates for the Administrative Office
for the coming fiscal year for the purpose of removing a substan­
tial part of its personnel and equipment from the Supreme Court
Building to rented quarters. This is in the nature of a temporary
measure to relieve the present crowded condition in the Supreme
Court Building, and the question of permanent quarters for the
                                   25 

    Administrative Office remains. After a full discussion the Con­
    ference resolved that the Administrative Office (1) be moved as
-   quickly as possible from the Supreme Court Building, (2) that
    an appropriation for moving be secured as soon as possible, and
    (3) that arrangements be made for permanent quarters for the
    Administrative Office. The Conference authorized a committee
    to be appointed to assist in these arrangements.

        THE JUDICIAL SURVIVORS' ANNUITY SYSTEM
       The Acting Director reported that the Judicial Survivors' Annu­
    ity System was in full operation and that the fund was in a satis­
    factory condition. On March 1, 1957 the Fund was worth $760,­
    506 and on that date annuities in the amount of $250,058 per
    year were being paid to 115 survivors of deceased federal judges.
    Almost 87 percent of the living judges eligible to corne under the
    system have elected to participate.

    COMPULSORY RETIREMENT OF JUDICIAL EMPLOYEES
      The Acting Director submitted a report to the Conference con­
    cerning the compulsory retirement of judicial employees under
    section 5 of the Civil Service Retirement Act as amended by Public
    Law 854, of the 84th Congress, approved July 31, 1956, and the
    re-employment of annuitants under section 13 of that Act. The
    report showed that a total of 85 judicial employees have been
    retired under the provisions of the Act for the period October 1,
    1956, the date the Act went into effect, through January 31, 1957.
    Of these 43 have been re-employed.

    CLASSIFICATION OF THE POSITION OF CHIEF DEPUTY
     CLERK OF THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT
     OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
      Chief Judge Edgerton brought to the attention of the Conference
    the request of the Judicial Council of the District of Columbia
    Circuit that the position of chief deputy clerk of the Court of
    Appeals of this circuit be reclassified from grade GS-12, $8,215
    per year, to grade GS-13, $8,990 per year. This position in the
    past has been graded higher than that of Chief Deputy Clerk
    in the other Courts of Appeals because of the unusual duties in­
    volved. The Conference approved the request.

    COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OJ? THE LAWS
   Circuit Judge Albert B. Maris for the Committee on the Re­
vision of the Laws submitted an information report upon certain
bills which have been introduced in the first session of the 85th
Congress. At the suggestion of the Committee the Conference
recommended the enactment of the following bills which contain
proposals previously endorsed by the Conference:
       (1) Appointment of an Additional Judge When a Disabled
    Judge Fails to Retire.-This legislation is contained in the
    bills S. 1341 and H. R. 110 (Cf. Rpt., Sept. Sess., 1956, p. 7).
       (2) Roster of "Senior Judges".-The bills, S. 1338 and H. R.
    3818, would carry out the recommendations of the Conference
    with respect to this proposal (Cf. Rpt., Sept. Sess., 1956, p.
    8).
       (3) Assignment to Active Duty of Former Territorial
    Judges Who are Receiving Salary Under Section 373 of Title
    28, United States Code.-The bill, H. R. 3371, embodies the
    recommendation on this subject of the Judicial Conference
    made at its September, 1956 session (Cf. Rpt., p. 43).
       (4) Furnishing the Congressional Record to Judges and
    Court Libraries.-A bill, H. R. 1164, would carry out this pro­
    posal approved by the Judicial Conference at its September,
    1956 session (Cf. Rpt., p. 44).
       (5) The District Court of Guam.-The bill, H. R. 4215, is
    identical with H. R. 10,360 of the 84th Congress which was
    approved by the Judicial Conference at its September, 1956
    session (Cf. Rpt., p. 45).
       (6) Tenure and Retirement of District Judges in Hawaii
    and Puerto Rico.-The bill, H. R. 3811, 85th Congress, is
    identical with H. R. 8621 of the 84th Congress on this subject
    which was approved by the Judicial Conference at its Sep­
    tember, 1956 session (Cf. Rpt., p. 46).
  The Committee recommended that the Conference disapprove
H. R. 818 relating to the eligibility of the members of the bar of
the United States Supreme Court to practice before all courts of
appeals and district courts of the United States except the district
court for the District of Columbia. The bill is identical with
H. R. 7461 of the 84th Congress which was disapproved by the
Judicial Conference at its September, 1956 session (Cf. Rpt.,
                                      27 

     p. 42). The Committee also recommended that the Conference
     disapprove H. R. 820 relating to the practice of law in the District
     of Columbia. This bill is identical with H. R. 151 of the 84th
     Congress which was disapproved by the Conference at its Sep­
     tember, 1956 session (Cf. Rpt., p. 43). The recommendation
     of the Committee that the bills H. R. 818 and H. R. 820 be dis­
     approved was adopted by the Conference.
        The following bills introduced in the 85th Congress not here­
     tofore considered by the Conference 'were referred to the Com­
     mittee on the Revision of the Laws for study and later report: S.
     345 to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to regulate
     judicial review by the district courts of deportation and exclusion
     orders; H. R. 272 to permit judicial review of decisions of the
     Administrator of Veterans Affairs and provide the procedure there­
     fore; H. R. 832 to amend section 10 (d) of the Administrative
     Procedure Act so as to broaden judicial relief under that section
     pending review of administrative action; S. 1000 to amend section
     1391 of Title 28, United States Code, relating to venue in the dis­
     trict courts in tort cases and cases where an official is a statutory
     agent; S. 188 and H. R. 285 which would provide for the registra­
     tion of State support orders in United States district courts and for
__   the enforcement of such orders by contempt proceedings; and
     H. R. 819 to amend section 1963 of Title 28, United States Code,
     so as to include among the judgments authorized by that section to
     be registered in another district those portions of divorce decrees
     issued by the territorial district courts which provide for the pay­
     ment of money or the transfer of property. The proposal con­
     tained in the bill, H. R. 3046, to provide for the transfer between
     the district courts and the Court of Claims of cases filed in either
     one of those courts which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of
     the other had been previously considered by the Conference (Cf.
     Rpt., Sept. Sess., 1954, p. 33; Mar. Sess., 1955, p. 22). This bill
     was also referred to the Committee.
        At the suggestion of Judge Maris the Conference authorized the
     Administrative Office to refer directly to the appropriate commit­
     tees of the Conference for their consideration, requests for reports
     submitted by Committees of the Congress with respect to bills
     pending in the Congress not heretofore considered by the Confer­
     ence and bills pending in the Congress coming to the attention of
     the Administrative Office which affect the judicial system.

  REPORTING OF THE OPINIONS OF THE COURT OF
                   CLAIMS
   Judge 'Vhitaker brought to the attention of the Conference the
desire of the Court of Claims to have its opinions reported with
those of the appellate courts in the National Reporter System.
He informed the Conference that the company concerned has de­
clined to do so on the grounds that a committee of the Conference
had directed otherwise. The Court of Claims was advised that
there is no regulation of the Judicial Conference of the United
States either restricting the publication of or requiring that pri­
vate reporting firms publish in any manner whatsoever the opin­
ions of the United States Courts.

PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS OF AP­
   PEALS OF THE EIGHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS
  At the request of Circuit Judge Whittaker, the Conference, pur­
suant to Title 28, U. S. C. 48, consented that terms of the Court of
Appeals of the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be
pretermitted during the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1957.
  At the request of Chief Judge Bratton, the Conference con­
sented that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit
at places other than Denver be pretermitted during the fiscal year
commencing July 1, 1957.

     CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER ADVISEMENT
   The Administrative Office submitted a report to the Conference
listing, by judge, 15 cases and motions which had been~held under
advisement more than 6 months on March 1, 1957. Where neces­
sary, these will be brought to the attention of the circuit council
by the chief judge of the circuit.
   The Conference declared a recess, subject to the call of the Chief
Justice.
   For the Judicial Conference of the United States.

                     APPENDIX 

                      REPORT 

                         OF 

      THE HONORABLE HERBERT BROWNELL, JR. 

     ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 

                      TO THE 

     JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES 





                  WASHINGTON, D. C. 


-                   MARCH 14. 1957
    Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference:
      I appreciate very much your invitation to appear at this special
    session of the Judicial Conference of the United States. As you
    know, at the request of the Chief Justice, the Attorney General
    makes an annual report to the September meeting of the Judicial
    Conference on matters of mutual concern which relate to the busi­
    ness of the courts. I do not propose, therefore, to make a detailed
    report today. Rather, I wish to discuss briefly several matters of
    current interest.
      The drive to reduce excessive delays and congestion in the Fed­
    eral courts is proceeding satisfactorily. As a part of it, the De­
    partment of Justice is actively supporting a number of legislative
    proposals which this Conference has recommended.
      The so-called "omnibus judgeship bill" to provide additional
    district and circuit judgeships is already under consideration by
    Congressional Committees and we hope for early enactment of this
    necessary legislation.
       Proposals which give recognition to the fact that improved
    judicial administration will aid immeasurably in this important
    endeavor are the bills to provide for relinquishment by Chief
    Judges of their administration duties at age seventy and to provide
    a roster of "Senior Judges" from judges who wish to take advan­
    tage of the retirement provisions of the law and yet are willing and
    able to undertake special judicial duties upon assignment by the
    Chief Justice.
       We also support the proposal to authorize the appointment of
    an additional judge when the Judicial Conference certifies that a
    judge eligible to retire is either mentally or physically disabled.
    This would in substance replace 28 U. S. C. § 371 (c) which was
    inadvertently repealed.
       The Department has also endorsed the Conference recommen­
    dation to provide for district court representation on the Judicial
    Conference and the legislation to make judicial per diem compar­
    able to that now authorized for many executive positions.
       In addition to the Conference recommendations, the Depart­
    ment is supporting two legislative proposals which the President

-                                   (81)
                               32 

mentioned in his recent Budget message. One would provide in
substance that whenever any district judge appointed to hold office
during good behavior attains the age of seventy years and neither
resigns nor retires, and the Judicial Conference of the United
States certifies to the President that there is need for an additional
judge in that district, the President may appoint, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, an additional judge for the
district.
   The other ,,,ould provide that the Congress extend an invitation
to the Chief Justice to address it in person on the state of the
Judiciary soon after the beginning of each session of Congress.
We are firmly convinced that the Judicial Branch needs a spokes­
man who can present effectively the immediate and long range
requirements of the courts and that the Chief Justice is the best
qualified person to speak persuasively and authoritatively on this
subject. We invite attention of the Judicial Conference to these
two proposals.
   I also wish to call to your attention a matter relating to national
defense emergency planning. 28 U. S. C. § 141 provides that
"Special terms of district court may be held at such places in the
district as the nature of the business may require, and upon such
notice as the court orders, pursuant to rules approved by the ju­
dicial council of the circuit." (Emphasis added.) The revisor's
note states that judicial council a,pproval was included in this pro­
vision to insure uniform practice among the courts for convening
special terms. 28 U. S. C. § 142 provides that "Court shall
be held only at places where Federal quarters and accommodations
are available or suitable quarters and accommodations are fur­
nished without cost to the United States."
   The premise underlying national defense emergency planning
is to insure the availability and use of existing civil authority in
the event of a national emergency to the maximum extent possible
consistent with the factual situation presented. Unquestionably,
 the continued availability of the Federal courts may be of the
 greatest importance. Yet it is possible to envisage a situation
 wherein the courts in a particular district might not be able to
 convene at their regular place of business.
   We are advised that at the present time the judicial councils
 have not promulgated rules to meet this possible contingency. In
 the event such authority was required, it might not be possible .-.,
 to convene the councils for that purpose. In these circumstances
                                     33 

    the Judicial Conference may wish to suggest to the judicial coun­
    cils the issuance of appropriate stand-by rules. Such rules might
    include authority to permit special sessions of court during an
    emergency anywhere within the district. In addition, the courts
    may wish to determine in advance appropriate alternate locations
    pursuant to section 142.
        I turn now to the special question concerning the examining
    functions which the Department of Justice has been performing
    for the Judicial Branch ever since the establishment of the Ad­
    ministrative Office of the United States Courts. While I recog­
    nize that we are all perhaps equally familiar with this matter, it
    may be useful to set forth briefly the factual background out of
    which this procedure emerged and why we are seeking at this time
    Judicial Conference approval of a transfer of these functions to
    the Administrative Office.
        Prior to the creation of the Administrative Office of the Courts,
    the responsibility for supervising the administration of the Courts
     and for securing judicial appropriations was vested in the Attorney
     General. With the enactment of the Administrative Office Bill,
     it was possible to transfer with relative ease and within a short
    period of time most of the functions which we had theretofore per­
    formed. However, because of budgetary problems, it was appar­
     ently not possible to make an immediate transfer of the task of
     inspecting or examining offices in the court system. Since it was
     necessary for the Department to maintain an inspection unit for
     the United States Attorneys' and Marshals' offices, and because
     of the budgetary problem involved, it was agreed that the Depart­
    ment would continue to examine the judicial posts for an interim
     period. This fact is reflected in the Report of the Judicial Con­
     ference of January 22, 1940, as follows:
            "With respect to the supervision of the finances of clerks
         and other officers of the courts.-Resolved, That the Con­
         ference is of the opinion that the supervision of the finances
         of the clerks and other officers of the courts is within the func­
         tion of the Administrative Office, but that for the time being,
         (italics supplied) due to the fact that appropriations are
         not adequate to provide for that purpose, it is the desire
         of the Conference that the field examinations shall be con­
         ducted by the Department of Justice as heretofore, and that

-        the Director be requested to notify the Department of Justice
                                 34
    to that effect, and also to request that the reports of its ex­
    aminations be communicated to the Director."                        ~
                                                                            .j

   At the September 1944 session, the Conference considered a
recommendation from the Judicial Conference of the Seventh Cir­
cuit that personnel examining the offices of the courts be trans­
ferred from the Department of Justice to the Administrative
Office but decided to take no action on the recommendation.
   In 1950, Congress enacted legislation (64 Stat. 380; 5 U. S. C.
341 (b)) which "empowered" the Attorney General to investigate
the official acts, records and accounts of the clerks of courts, pro­
bation officers, referees, trustees and receivers in bankruptcy, com­
missioners, and court reporters "at the request of and in behalf of
the Director of the Administrative Office." This legislation was
enacted solely in order to provide that requests for appropriations
from year to year would not be withheld on a point of order. The
language contained in this provision makes it perfectly clear that
there has been no change in the view that the function was prop­
erly one for the Director of the Administrative Office. Thus
while we are expressly authorized to make such investigations the
law does not require it.
   The Administrative Office was created because it was generally
recognized that under the doctrine of separation of powers it was
wholly inappropriate for the Department of Justice to be responsi­
ble for the administration of the Judicial Branch of the Govern­
ment. Certainly the present procedure under which Departmental
officials are called upon to examine the records and books and offi­
cial acts of court personnel comes within this general principle.
The duties vested in the Director of the Administrative Office by
28 U. S. C. 601 respecting supervision, examination, and audit­
ing of vouchers of court personnel make it clear that Congress did
not contemplate that the Department should continue to exercise
this function. Indeed, except for the budgetary problem involved,
which tended through inadvertence to perpetuate itself, presum­
ably this function would have been transferred out of the Depart­
ment long ago.
   Therefore, our primary reason for seeking a transfer of these
examining duties to the Administrative Office is our strong belief
that it is inappropriate for the Department to supervise and ex­
amine the activities of a separate branch of the Government. In
addition, however, we are currently undergoing a reorganization         "



which will result in the disbandment of the unit which heretofore
                               35 

has performed examinations, including that of the courts. It is
this latter aspect which results in this matter being brought to
your attention at this time.
   We have discussed this matter with Mr. Whitehmst with a
view to transferring, in conjunction with this reorganization, the
responsibility for comt inspections to the Administrative Office.
It has been determined that 67.2% of the time of the present
examiners is consumed in comt examining work. This represents
approximately $75,000 of the appropriation allotted to the overall
examining function. Subject to Judicial Conference approval, it
was proposed that a transfer of this function might be effectuated
by requesting the Senate Appropriations Committee to reduce om
appropriation and increase the Judicial appropriation in the above
amount in the pending budget for the fiscal year 1958. If this
could be accomplished, the smplus experienced personnel in our
examining unit could be transferred to the Administrative Office
as of July 1, 1957.
    For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully seek Judicial
Conference approval of this action.
    FinaHy, in my report to the Judicial Conference of last Septem­
ber, I indicated that the Department of Justice would undertake
a comprehensive study of sentencing procedures in criminal cases
in the Federal district comts. This matter is currently receiving
top priority consideration by the Department and by the Advisory
Corrections Council on which both the Chief Justice and the At­
 torney General have designated members.
    The basic shortcoming of the present sentencing system is the
lack of a uniform sentencing philosophy. This has resulted in
 disparate sentences being imposed even where by comparison the
crime and the background of the criminal are substantially similar.
Such a result is unfair and poses serious morale problems. There­
fore, in consultation with representatives of the comts we are
 attempting to formulate a program (both legislative and admin­
istrative) which will provide for greater uniformity in sentences
 without at the same time withholding from the sentencing author­
 ity the power to fit the punishment to the criminal and not
necessarily to the crime.
    am study is by no means complete, and for this reason I am
 not in a position to commen t on the specifics of any recommenda­
 tion. However, we plan in the near future to submit a draft of
 legislation for your consideration.
