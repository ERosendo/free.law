                                  4


REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
          OFFICE OF THE U.S. COURTS
   Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office, had
previously submitted to the members of the Conference his re­
port for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1959, in accordance with
the provisions of 28 United States Code 604(a) (3). The Con­
ference approved the immediate release of the report for publi­
cation and authorized the Director to revise and supplement it in
the final printed edition to be issued later.
   Mr. Olney addressed the Conference and called attention par­
ticularly to the urgent problems facing the judiciary, as outlined
in his report. He reported also that many proposals contained
in the legislative program of the Judicial Conference had been
acted upon favorably by the Congress and that the Chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, Honorable James O. Eastland,
and the Chairman of the Rouse Judiciary Committee, Honorable
Emanuel Celler, have cooperated in giving full consideration to
Conference proposals.
  "State of the Dockets of the Federal Courts-Courts of Ap­
peals.-Despite heavy caseloads in some circuits, the Courts of
Appeals are disposing of cases promptly and keeping up with their        ()
work. Cases filed during the fiscal year 1959 totaled 3,754, which
is a slight increase over last year. There were 3,753 cases ter­
minated, one less than the number filed, leaving 2,034 cases re­
maining for disposition on June 30,1959.
   While there has been only a slight variation in the backlog of
pending cas~ in the Courts of Appeals during the last five years,
the median time interval from the filing of the complete record to
final disposition has decreased slowly. For cases terminated after
hearing or submission in all courts of appeals in 1959, the median
was 6.7 months, compared with 7.0 months in 1958, 7.1 months in
1957, and 7.4 months in 1956. The record of the courts of appeals
in keeping up with their work in 1959 is due in large measure to
the contribution of the senior judges who have continued to sit in
their own circuit.'l, and of the district judges who have been sitting
by designation in the courts of appeals. The caseloads in the
Second, Fourth and. Fifth Circuits, however, continue to be
excessive.
                                       5

         District Courts.-Despite a substantial decrease in civil filings,
      the district courts faced a heavy workload throughout fiscal year
       1959. They entered the year on July 1, 1958, with 68,168 civil
      casee and 7,451 criminal cases pending and, during the year, re­
      ceived an additional 57,800 civil cases and 28,729 criminal cases
      by new filings. Filings of civil cases were down by 9,000 during
      fiscal 1959, a reduction of 13.9 percent. This reduction in filings
      was brought about mainly by the Act of July 25, 1958, which
      altered the jurisdiction of the district courts, although the United
      States cases were down by more than 1,000.
         The district courts during the year terminated 62,172 civil cases
      and 28,521 criminal ca·ses, or almost 1,000 more cases than in 1958.
     The decrease in civil filings, plus the increased termination of
     cases by the district judges, has resulted in an overall decrease in
      the backlog of 4,372 cases, leaving 63,796 civil cases pending on
     June 30, 1959. Pending criminal cases increased slightly to 7,727
     from 7,451 at the end of fiscal 1958. The overall result, there­
      fore, is that the United States district courts were able, during
     fiscal 1959, to reduce the pending backlog by only 5.4 percent and
     ended the year with a civil-criminal combined workload of 71,523
     cases.
(C       The median time interval from filing to disposition of civil
     cases tried increased more than a month to 15.3 months in 1959
     compared with 13.9 months in 1958. The interval from filing to
     trial also increased to 13.3 months compared with 11.9 months in
     1958. These increases reflect mostly the increased activity in the
     district courts in disposing of the older pending cases.
         Bankruptcy cases filed in the district courts in 1959 reached a
     newall-time peak of 100,672 as the filing of petitions by wage­
     earning employees and other non-business debtors continued to
     spiral upward. Business filings were 11,729, or 11.7 per cent of
     the total and non-business filings, including petitions by wage­
     earning employee~, were 88,943 or 88.3 per cent of the bankruptcy
     business. During the year a record 96,845 bankruptcy cases were
     closed, or 21.5 per cent more than in 1958. Even so, filings out­
     stripped terminations, and 3,800 cases were added to the backlog,
     which climbed to 84,273 on June 30, 1959, a newall-time high.

            EXPEDITION OF COURT BUSINESS
   The Conference received reports from the Chief Judge of the
Court of Claims and from the Chief Judges of the respective cir­
cuits, concerning the state of the dockets and the need for addi­
tional judicial assistance in each district and circuit. These reports
were supplemented by the district judges who presented additional
details concerning the business of the district courts in their
circuits.
   On recommendation of its Committees on Court Administration
and Judicial Statistics, the Conference took no further action with
respect to the need for additional judgeships, but directed the Com­
mittees to report thereon at the next session of the Conference in
March. The Conference reiterated its concern over the condition
of the dockets in many courts and called attention to the continuing
need for the additional judgeships previously recommended.

   At the request of Judge William C. Mathes, the Conference re­
ferred to the Committees on Judicial Statistics and Court Admin­
istration a proposal to provide for two district judgeships for the
District of Alaska.

     REPORT OF THE COJ\fMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
                                                                         (   )
   Chief Judge Charles E. Clark, Chairman of the Committee on
the Budget, submitted the estimates of appropriations for the fiscal
year 1961. These estimates were prepared by the Director of the
Administrative Office pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 605 and were approved
by' the Committee. The estimates show increases aggregating, $'2,­
635,900 over appropriations for the fiscal year 1960 and show a
total increase of 204 in the number of positions requested for 1961.
On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved
the budget estimates presented, subject to amendments which may
be required by action of the Conference at this meeting, or by leg­
islation enacted by the Congress prior to the submission of these
estimates to the Bureau of the Budget.
   Estimates of supplemental appropriations for the, fiscal year
1960 which include $40,000 forthe fees of the United States com­
missioners; an appropriate sum (not to exceed $70,000) to cover
the increased subsistence allowance provided by Public Law 86­
138; $12,000 for the purchase of transcripts for persons permitted
                                      7

      to appeal in forma pauperis; $270,000 for the purchase of furni­
      ture previously furnished by the General Services Administration;
     and $100,000 for the salaries and expenses of referees in bank­
     ruptcy, were also submitted by the Committee. On recommenda­
     tion of the Committee, the Conference authorized the Director
     of the Administrative Office to submit to the Congress estimates
     of supplemental appropriations in such amounts as he deems
     appropriate for the purposes stated above.
        The Conference discussed fully the presentation before the Con­
     gress of the budget for the judiciary in prior years and authorized
     the Committee, with the assistance of the Administrative Office,
     to develop a plan for improving the annual presentation of the
     budget estimates to the Congress. The Chief Justice was author­
     ized to increase the size of the Budget Committee or to reconsti­
     tute it as he may see fit.
        The overall problems of court administration in multiple-judge
     courts were also discussed, and the Chief Justice was authorized by
     the Conference to appoint a committee of the Conference consist­
     ing of the thirteen chief judges of district courts having five or
     more judgeships to meet and consider the personnel and hudgetary
«(   rc-quirements of the large district courts.

     JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEES ON COURT
       ADMINISTRATION AND REVISION OF THE LAWS
        Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on
     Revision of the Laws, submitted a report on legislative proposals
     considered jointly by the Committees on Court Administration
     and Revision of the Laws:
        (1) H.R. 594, H.R. 947, H.R. 975, H.R. 1202, H.R. 5986, H.R.
     8375, H.R. 2272, and S. 1490, 86th Congress, to authorize various
     types of judicial review of veterans' clai1rb8.-The Conference, at
     previous sessions, had taken no position with respect to the policy
     involved in providing judicial review of veterans' claims, but rec­
     ommended that if such review is to be granted, that it should be
     in a district court sitting in the veteran's locality and not in a
     United States Court of Appeals or a special court, and further that
     the review, if granted, should be in accordance with the standards
     of the Administrative Procedure Act. (Conf.Rept., Sept; 1957;
     p. 36; March 1958; pp. 26 and 27).. -On reoon:u:ilendation of the
                                  8

Committees the Conference reaffirmed its position with respect to
these proposals.
   (2) H.R. 1107, 86th Congress, to amend the National Labor
Relations Act to require the trial of unfair labor practice cases in
the federal district courts.-The proposal would continue the N a­
tional Labor Relations Board as an administrative agency respon­
sible for the handling of representation matters including the
conduct of elections, but would transfer unfair labor practice cases
to the district courts. The Conference considered the proposal
and voted to disapprove it on the ground that it would enlarge the
jurisdiction of the district courts to embrace litigation of (',ontro­
versies of a type and character which the district courts are not
organized or equipped to adjudicate and for which there appears
110 historical precedent.
   (3) H.R. fJ807, 86th Congress, to authorize a new type of judicial
review of administrative orders for the deportation of aliens from
the United States, which, except as to aliens in custody, would be
f'Xclusive.-This proposal would permit an alien to file a petition
for the review of a deportation order in a United States Court of
Appeals within six months from the date of the final order. In
so doing, the bill implements and applies Section 10 of the Ad­
ministrative Procedure Act, and, with some exceptions, makes.
the procedure of the Hobbs Act (5 U.S.c. 1031 et seq.) applicable
to the judicial review of deportation orders. The review would
be had upon the administrative record upon which the order was
based, and the Attorney General's findings of fact, if supported
by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record
considered as a whole, would be conclusive. The right of any
alien in custody to petition for a writ of habeas corpus would be
preserved. The Committees stated that the proposal is intended
to do away with delays which heretofore had been encountered
as a result of repeated litigation in deportation proceedings, some
of which had been carried on for many years. On recommendation
of the Committees, the Conference approved the bill.
   (4) Jurisdiction of the district {)ourts in actions commenced by
fiduciaries by reason of diversity of citizenship.-It was brought
to the attention of the Committees that a practice had arisen in a
number of districts of procuring the appointment of a non-resident
administratory gua,rdi~n, or other fiduciary for a decedent or minor
                                             9

       having a claim against a local resident, in order to create diversity
       of citizenship so that suit may be brought on the claim in the
       United States district court. The Committees were of the view
       that the practice is undesirable and not within the spirit of the
       diversity jurisdiction. The Conference thereupon approved the
       following draft of a bill, presented by the Committees, which would
       eliminate this practice:
       A BILL To withdraw from the district courts jurisdiction of suits brought by
        fiduciaries who have been appointed for the purpose of crf>~ting diversity of
        citizenship between the parties

               Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
            of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
            section 1332 of title 28, United States Code, as amended,
            is further amended by inserting at the end of subsection
            (a) thereof an additional paragraph reading as follows:
               "Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsec­
            tion a district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action
            commenced by an administrator, guardian, trustee or other
            fiduciary who is a citizen of a State other than that of which
            the defendant is a citizen unless it appears either (1) that
(( 	        the plaintiff's decedent was or any ward or other beneficiary
            of the plaintiff is, a citizen of a State other than that of which
            the defendant is a citizen or (2) that the appointment of the
            plaintiff as such fiduciary was not obtained for the purpose
            of creating diversity of citizenship between the parties in
            order to invoke. the jurisdiction of the court."
       The Chief Justice did not participate in the consideration of this
       proposal.
          (5) The status of retired circuit and district judges.-The Com­
       mittees reported that various questions had arisen as to the status
       of retired circuit and district judges with respect to their participa­
       tion in cert.a.in activities of their former courts when they are
       assigned to active duty therein. These include the participation
       of retired circuit and district judges in the appointment of officers
       of the 'court and in the promUlgation of court rules, and, in the
       case of retired circuit judges, membership on the judicial council
       of the circuit and of the court of appeals sitting in bane. It was
       the view of the Committees that under the statute only judges
       who are in "regular active service", that is, those who have not
                                      :10 

retired under Section <371 (b) or 372Ea), Title 28, United States
Code, are the judges in "active service" to which the statutes refer.
However, the Committees thought it proper to permit a retired
CIrcmt judge to be a member of the court of appeals sitting in
bane in the rehearing of a case in which he has sat, by assignment,
in the panel of the court which heard the case originally. The Con­
ference agreed and thereupon approved the following draft of a
bill, presented by the Committees, clarifying thestatute and in­
corporating the change suggested.
A BILL To clarify the status of circuit and district judges retired from regular
                                active service

          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
      of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
      (a) Paragraph (b) of section 43 of title 28, United States
     Code, is amended to read as follows:
          "(b) Each court of appeals shall consist of the circuit
      judges of the circuit in regular active service. The circuit
     justice and justices or judges designated or assigned shall also
     be competent to sit as judges of the court."
        . (b) Paragraph (c) of section 46 of title 28, United States
     Code, is amended to read as follows:
         "(c) Gases and controversies shall be heard and determined
     by a court or division of not more than three judges, unless a
     hearing or rehearing before the court in banc is ordered by
     a majority of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in regu­
     lar active service. A court in bane shall consist of all circuit
     judges in regular active service. A circuit judge of the cir­
     cuit who has retired from regular active service shall also' be
     competent to sit as a judge of the court in bane in the rehear­
     ing of a case or controversy if he sat in the court or division
     at the original hearing thereof."                       ,
         SEC. 2. Paragraph (b) of section 132 of title 28, United
     States Code, is amended to read as follows:
         "(b) Each district court shall consist of the district judge
     or judges for the district in regular active service. Justices or
     judges designated or assigned shall be competent to si~ as
     judges of the court.
         SEC. 3. The first sentence of section 332 of title 28, United
   . S~ates Code~ is amended to read as follows: . iiThe chief judge
                                              <




                                                                                   (
                                         11
          of each circuit shall call, at least twice in each year and at
          such places as he may designate, a council of the circuit judgell\
          for the circuit, in regular active service, at which he shall
          preside."
      The,Chief Justice did not participate in the consideration of this
      proposal.
          (6) Abolition of terms of court.-Judge Maris reported that the
       proposal of Chief Judge Carl A. Hatch of the District of New
      Mexico to repeal the statutes relating to the holding of terms of
      court and to provide that the court shall be in continuous session,
       which was referred to the Committee on Court Administration at
      the last session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 13), was under
      study by a sub-committee. Accordingly, the Conference granted
       leave to the Committees to report upon this matter at a later
      session of the Conference.
          (7) H.R. 3217, 86th Congress, to provide that a corporation for
      purposes of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction shall be deemed to
       be a citizen not only of the state of its incorporation, but also of
       every state in which it is qualified to do business.-The Confer­
       ence at its March 1959 session (Con£. Rept., p. 12) directed the
((     Committees to make a study of H.R. 3217 and any bill of similar
       import which may be introduced. The Committees reported that
       the American Law Institute, at the suggestion of the Chief Jus­
       tice, had recently undertaken a comprehensive study of the di­
       versity of citizenship jurisdiction of the district courts. The Com­
       mittees, therefore, requested and were granted leave by the
       Conference to establish a sub-committee to collaborate with the
       American Law Institute on its project and to defer its report on
       H.R. 3217 to a later session of the Conference. The Committees
       were further directed to consider the proposal of Judge Bailey
       Aldrich to prohibit a plaintiff from prosecuting an action under the
       diversity statute in a district court sitting in the state of which he is
       a citizen.
          (8) S. 2708 and H.R. 9234 to provide for amendments to the
       compact between the people of Puerto Rico and the United
       States.-These bills (which supersede S. 2023 and H.R. 5926)
       would provide for an amended compact between the people of
     . Puerto Rico and the United States consisting of sixteen Articles.
       Only Articles XIII and XIV affect the federal judiciary. Article
                                 12 

 XIII relates to the United States District Court for the District
of Puerto Rico and provides in paragraph (a) that its jurisdiction
shall be the same as that provided by law with respect to district
courts of the United States in the various districts in the states of
the Union; in paragraph (b) that all proceedings in the court shall
be in the English language except that if the judge determines
that the interests of justice so require and the parties consent,
he may order a trial to be conducted in the Spanish language; in
paragraph (c) that the qualifications of jurors in the district court
shall be the same as those for jurors in the other federal district
courts, except that jurors in proceedings conducted in the Spanish
language need not have a knowledge of English; and in paragraph
 (d) that no suit to restrain the assessment or collection of any
tax imposed under the laws of Puerto Rico shall be maintained in
any United States court. Article XIV provides that the final
judgments of the highest court of Puerto Rico shall be subject to
review by the Supreme Court of the United States in like manner
as the decisions of the highest courts of the several states of the
Union, rather than by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
as at present.
   The Committees recommended that the Conference approve
paragraphs (a) and (d) of Article XIII which incorporate exist­
ing law and all of Article XIV which incorporates a proposal pre­
viously approved by the Conference (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1957, p.
40). The Committees further recommended the amendment of
paragraphs (b) and (c) of Article XIII so as to eliminate the au­
thority to conduct trials in the Federal District Court in Puerto
Rico in the Spanish language and the provision that jurors in
such trials need not have a knowledge of English. It was the view
of the Committees that since the United States District Court for
the District of Puerto Rico is an integral part of the federal ju­
dicial system, its proceedings should continue to be conducted in
the English language in accordance with the practice which has
always been followed in the federal courts everywhere and which
has been followed in that court ever since its creation. Upon the
recommendation of the Committees, the Conference approved
Article XIV of S. 2708 and H.R. 9234 and also approved Article
XIII of the bills, provided that paragraphs (b) and (0) thereof
are amended to read as follows:
                                   13
        H (b) All proceedings in said Court shall be conducted in

     the English language.
        tI ( c) Qualifications of jurors, as fixed by the statutory laws

     of the United States, shall apply to jurors selected to serve
     in the United States courts in Puerto Rico."
Judge Maris was granted permission to release immediately Con­
ference action with respect to these proposals.
   (9) S. 1489 and H.R. 5111 to provide judicial review of the ad­
 ministrative removal or suspension of federal employees.-The
proposal contained in S. 1489 would empower the United States
district courts to entertain appeals of civilian employees of the
Executive Branch of the Government for reinstatement or restora­
tion to duty following final action by the appropriate adminis­
trative authority for their removal or suspension without pay from
the service or, concurrently with the Court of Claims, for com­
pensation for their period of removal or suspension, or both. The
proposal contained in H.R. 5111 would empower the district courts
to entertain suits by persons dismissed for cause, or suspended
without pay from positions in the classified civil service, to have
such dismissal or suspension set aside and reinstatement directed.
The Committees were of the view that the ultimate decision as
to the retention of employees in the Executive Branch of the Gov­
ernment should remain in the Executive Branch and that judicial
review of such decisions is neither appropriate nor justified. More­
over, the enactment of these bills would materially increase con­
gestion in the United States district courts. On recommendation
of the Committees, the Conference disapproved the bills.

JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORTING
  PERSONN;EL AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT AD­
  MINISTRATION
   Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
Supporting Personnel and of the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration, made a joint report for the two Committees.
                            Clerks' Fees
  The Committee reported that they had been informed by the
Bankruptcy Committee of a proposed change in the special charges
    533192-59-3
                                  14
to be made by referees for copy work to provide a certification
fee of 50 cents for each certificate to be attached to a copy of a
document presented for comparison and certification, in addition
to the regular comparison fees. The Committees were of the
view that a similar charge should be made by the clerks of court
                                                                         I
                                                                         II
and recommended that the schedule of fees for the comparison and
certification of copies presented for certification, approved by the
Conference at its March 1959 session (Con£. Rept., p. 8), be
further amended in accordance with the above to read as follows:
      "For comparing with the original thereof any copy (except
    a photographic reproduction) of any transcript of record,
    entry, record or paper, when such copy is furnished by the
    person requesting certification, 10 cents for each page of 250
    words or fraction thereof, and 50 cents for each certificate.
      "For comparing with the original thereof any photographic
    reproduction of any record or paper not made by or under
    the supervision of the clerk, 5 cents for each page and 50 cents
    for each certificate."
The recommendation was approved by the Conference.
  The Committees also recommended that the schedule of fees
to be charged by the clerks of court for the preparation and mail­
ing of notices in bankruptcy cases be amended to conform with
the schedule of such charges to be made by referees as hereinafter
approved by the Conference. The Conference approved this rec­
ommendation and directed that paragraph 4 of the schedule of
miscellaneous fees of the clerks of the United States district courts,
approved by the Conference at its September 1945 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 25) be amended to read as follows:
       "4. For the preparation and mailing of each set of notices
    in asset cases and in cases filed under the relief chapters of
    the Bankruptcy Act, in excess of 30 notices per set, 10 cents
    for each additional notice on the first 10,000 and 5 cents per
    notice on the balance, provided that in no proceeding admin­
    istered in straight bankruptcy shall the total charge for this
    special service exceed 25 percent of the net proceeds realized
    in asset cases."
  Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Administrative Office had
called to the attention of the Committees the fact that no uniform
                                         15 

       system or procedure is followed in respect to the sale by the clerks
       of the district courts of copies of the opinions of their courts. The
       Committees have requested the Administrative Office to make a
       study of the charges for copies of district court opinions through­
       out the United States and Territories and to report thereon with
       recommendations. The Conference granted leave to the Com­
       mittees to consider this matter and report at a future session of
       the Conference.
                                  Court Reporters
          Chief Judge Biggs reported that a sub-committee, under the
       chairmanship of Judge William C. Mathes, has undertaken a com­
       prehensive study of the court reporting system, including the
       status of court reporters, their salaries, their fees, and the nature
       of their work. The Bureau of the Budget, assisted by the Ad­
       ministrative Office, is also engaged in a survey of the court report­
       ing system, and tests of various electronic recording systems have
       been made by the Administrative Office. Upon recommendation
       of the Committees, the Conference adopted the following resolu­
       tions prepared by the Sub-committee on Court Reporters:
          L That no change be made in the present reporting system, or
(( 	   in salaries or transcript rates in general, until such time as the
       survey now being made by the Bureau of the Budget is com­
       pleted, and full information can be made available.
          2. That the Administrative Office be instructed, wherever pos­
       sible and agreeable to the judges concerned, to supply electronic
       recording systems for use in the United States district courts
       whenever a vacancy occurs in the office of the existing court
       reporter.
          3. That the Administrative Office be authorized to supply elec­
       tronic recording systems to the courts of appeals, when requested.
         4. That the Administrative Office be instructed to include in
       the budget estimates the amount necessary to implement the sec­
       ond and third recommendations.
          5. As presently advised, the Sub-committee believes that the
       statute (28 U.S.C. 753) is adequate without amendment to au­
       thorize an electronic recording system in the district court, pro­
       vided the deputy clerk, or other officer entrusted with the keeping
       of a log in the courtroom and supervising or making the tran­
       scription, is designated by order of the court as an official reporter
C_ 	   and authorized, as such, to certify the transcript.
                                      16 

   The Committees reported that the judges of the Western Dis­
trict of Kentucky had requested the reclassification of their court
reporters from "non-metropolitan" at a salary of $6,505, to "metro­
politan" at a salary of $7,095 per annum. Only recently, the re­
porters in this district were raised to the higher classification of
"non-metropolitan" from the "rural" classification, which was
abolished by the Conference in September 1958 (Conf. Rept., p.
12). The Conference approved the recommendation of the Com­
mittee that the reclaSsification not be granted.
  At the request of Chief Judge Biggs, the Committees were au­
thorized to consider the problem of the transcription of the notes
of deceased court reporters.
                   Law Clerks and Secretaries
   The Conference at its March 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 10)
authorized the Committee on Supporting Personnel to consider
further the qualification standards for law clerks and secretaries
to judges submitted to the Committees by the Administrative
Office. The Committees reported that many communications from
judges had been received suggelilting that the present qualifica­
tion standards for law clerks and secretaries are insufficient and
inadequate, and that careful consideration had been given to the
proposed amendments to these standards prepared and submitted
by the Administrative Office. After a full discussion, the Con­
ference approved the following revised qualification standards for
law clerks and secretaries submitted by the Committees:

(( 	   committee of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of
       Representatives on Appropriations for the Judicia,ry for the fiscal

       ployment of crier-law clerks in the courts. At that time no
       statutory authority satisfactory to the Sub-committee was cited.
       The question was thereafter considered by the Committees and
       reported to the Conference. After a full discussion, the Confer­
       ence directed that the matter be held in abeyance until an opinion
       could be obtained from the Comptroller General.

       thorize the employment of interpreters on a contract or per diem
       basis and to authorize the payment of fees of psychiatrists when
       employed in the United States District Court for the Southern
       District of New York (See Conf. Rept., March 1959, p. 14). The
                                 20

submitted to the Committees a draft of a bill to provide the ju­
diciary with the same authority given to the Executive Branch of

mendation of the Committees, the Conference approved the pro­
posed legislation in principle and recommended that suitable
legislation of this
                . type be enacted .
   Fees and Mileage of TVitnesses in Habeas Corpus Proceedings
   The Committees reported that memoranda had been submitted
by the Administrative Office with respect to the proposal to provide
for the payment of fees and mileage of witnesses in habeas corpus
proceedings brought by persons authorized to proceed in forma
pauperis, which was referred to the Committees by the Conference
at its March 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p.14). However, the mat­
ter requires additional study, and the Committees were granted
leave by the Conference to consider the matter further and to
report at a, later session of the Conference.

      Terms of District Judges on the Judicial Conference
  Chief Judge Biggs reported that there had been referred to the
CJ0mmittee on Court Administration by the Administrative Office
the resolution of the Judicial Conference of the Sixth Circuit re­
questing that the term of Judge Paul Jones as a member of the
Judicial Conference be regarded as one of three years from the
time of his election, rather than from the date of the approval
of the statute. This would extend the term of Judge Jones to
August 1961 instead of August 1960. It was the sense of the
Committees that in the light of the statutory provisions and the
administrative interpretation thereof by the resolution of the
Judicial Conference, dated March 18, 1958 (Conf. Rept., p. 10),
that the term of Judge Jones, as district judge representative, will
expire on August 28, 1960 and may not be extended unless by
way of re-election. The Conference concurred in the views of
the Committees.

mendations of Congressman Emanuel Celler (1) that the Con~
ference undertake a comprehensive study of the organization and
function of the Judicial Councils of the Circuits, their jurisdiction
over the internal affairs of the courts of the circuits, and the advis­
ability of including district judge representatives on the circuit
councils and (2) that the Conference undertake a survey of the
geographical organization of the entire federal judicial system in
the light of population increases and economic changes, which will
include a study of the adequacy of the present number of places
of holding court, had been referred to the Committee on Court
Administration by the Chief Justice. The Chairman of the Com~
mittees has been authorized to appoint a sub-committee or sub­
committees to consider Congressman Celler's recommendations.

tration of the courts. These sub-committees will be appointed and
reports to the Conference in respect to these matters will be made
as soon as possible.

tration the proposal of Judge William C. Mathes that a seminar

judges, in order to permit an exchange of views with some of the
more experienced judges on subjects such as the handling of cal­
endars, juries, pre-trial conferences and the day-to-day practical
conduct of the district court in such a manner as best to dispatch
the judicial business.
   The Conference also referred to the Committee on Court Ad­
ministration the proposal of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth

ruptcy Act, with the request that the district judges advise the
Judicial Councils of their respective circuits of their views with

Office of the views of the Judicial Councils of their circuits. The
Committee considered the report of the Director, together with
the views expressed by the district judges and the circuit councils.
                                                                        )

                                                                                            1
                                                                                            I


        (1) 	 Designated Chico as an additional place of holding court for the referee
            at Eureka, effective October 1, 1959.

                                    TENTH CIRCUIT
      District of Ooloraao:
        (1) 	Designated Durango and Sterling as additional places of holding court
            for the referees at Denver, effective October 1, 1959.

                                         LEGISLATION

       The Committee called attention to the following legislative pro­

    posals affecting bankruptcy administration pending before the 

    86th Congress: 

       (1) H.R. 4850 to give the bankruptcy court summa:ry jurisdic­

    tion in actions brought involving preferences, lien8, fraudulent 

                                     25 

    transfers, and the trustee's title to property.-Upon the recom­
    mendation of the Conunittee, the Conference reaffirmed its ap­
    proval of this bill.
       (2) H.R. 6556 to amend Section 39c of the Bankruptcy Act,
    11 U.S.C. 67(c), to clarify the time for filing a petition to review
    a referee's order.-The Conunittee suggested that the bill, now
    pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee, be amended by
    inserting after the second sentence the following:
        "Unless the person aggrieved shaH petition for review of such
        order within such lO-day period, or any extension thereof, the
        order of the referee shall become final."
    On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved
    the amendment and authorized the Administrative Office to pre­
    sent it to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
       (3) H.R. 6818 to amend Section 57a of the Bankruptcy Act,
    11 U.S.C. 93a, and 18 U.S.C. 152, to eliminate the requirement
    tlwt proofs of claim be verified under oath.-The Committee re­
    ported that an additional amendment has been proposed to H.R.
    6816, which would preserve the present standing of a verified proof
    of claim as prima facie evidence of the validity and the amount of
    the claim. The bill is now pending before the Senate Judiciary
    Committee. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Ad­
    ministrative Office was authorized to request the Senate Judiciary
    Committee to amend the bill by adding the following sentence:
        "A proof of claim filed in accordance with the requirements
        of the Bankruptcy Act, the General Orders of the Supreme
        Court, and the official forms, even though not verified under
        oath, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and
        amount of the claim."
      (4) H.R. 7233 to amend Section 832 of Clwpter XIII (Wage
    Earner Plans) of the' Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 1032, relating
    to the first meeting of creditors and the filing of proofs of claim.­
    This bill, now pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
    would require the filing of proofs of claim in Chapter XIII cases
    in accordance with Section 57n of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.
    93n) and would clarify the provisions with respect to the first
    meeting of creditors. The Committee recommended that the bill

(
                                 26
be amended by striking the last sentence of Section 632 as now
contained therein and substituting the following:
      uln the event such first meeting shall not be held as pro­
    vided herein, then the court shall cause such meeting to be
    held promptly upon not less than 5 days' notice to the debtor,
    creditors, and other parties in interest."
The Conference approved the Committee's recommendation, and
authorized the Administrative Office to request such an amend­
ment to the bill.
   (5) H.R. 7727 to amend Sections 334, 367 and 369 of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 734, 767 and 769, and to add a new Section
355 so as to require proofs of claim to be filed and to limit the time
within which claims may be filed in Chapter XI (Arrangements)
proceedings to the time prescribed by Section 57n of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 93n.-On recommendation of the Commit­
tee, the Administrative Office was directed to make a further study
of the need for these amendments to Chapter XI and to report
thereon to the next meeting of the Bankruptcy Committee.
                 SUPPLEMENTAL ApPROPRIATIONS

   The Committee reported that it had approved the estimates             (
of supplemental appropriations contained in the report of the
Budget Committee for salaries of referees for the fiscal year 1960
in the amount of $25,000, to cover the cost of additional positions
and salary increases, and the estimates of $75,000 for expenses of
referees, to cover the salaries of additional clerical employees,
                                                                             j
                                                                             I

telephone expense, rent, and the cost of furniture in buildings
operated by the General Services Administration.
                 SPECIAL CHARGES BY REFEREES

   The Administrative Office had suggested to the Committee that,
in view of the increased postal rates, it would be desirable to
change the schedule of charges for the preparation and mailing
of notices in bankruptcy cases to provide a uniform charge of 5
cents per notice for all notices in excess of to,OOO. Upon the
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference amended the
first paragraph of the schedule of special charges for referees

                                                                         /
                                                                         \
                                    27 

    promulgated under Section 40c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11
    U.S.C. 68c(3), to read as follows:
        1. 	For the preparation and mailing of each set of notices in
             asset cases and in cases filed under the relief chapters of
             the Act, in excess of 30 notices per set, 10 cents for each
             additional notice on the first 10,000 and 5 cents per notice
             on the balance, provided, that in no proceeding admin­
             istered in straight bankruptcy shall the total charge for
             this special service exceed 25 percent of the net proceeds
             realized in asset cases.
       The Committee called attention to the action of the Conference
    at its March 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 25) which amended
    paragraph (4) of the schedule of special charges to provide a
    charge, not originally included in the schedule, for photographic
    reproductions made in the office of the referee. It was pointed
    out, however, that while a charge is now provided for m~ng
    photographic reproductions, no charge has been provided for
    certifying photographic reproductions or other copy not made in
    the referee's office. The Committee reported that the Administra­
    tive Office had recommended a fee of 50 cents for the certification
    of any document not prepared in the referee's office. Upon the
    recommendation of the Committee, the Conference amended para­
    graph (4) to include such certification fee. The amended para­
    graph is as follows:
        4. 	For making a copy (except a photographic reproduction)
             of any record or paper, and the certification thereof, 65
             cents per page of 250 words or fraction thereof.
             For comparing with the original thereof any copy (ex­
             cept a photographic reproduction) of any transcript of
             record, entry, record, or paper when such copy is fur­
             nished by the person requesting certification, 10 cents
             for each page of 250 words or fraction thereof and 50
             cents for each certificate.
             For a photographic reproduction of any record or paper,
             and the certification thereof, 50 cents for each page. For·
             comparing with the original thereof any photographic
             reproduction of any record or paper not made by the

                                    28
           referee 5 cents for ea.ch page and 50 cents for ea.ch
           certificate.
                      RETIREMENT OF REFEREES

   The Committee reported that the Administrative Office had 

 brought to its attention several proposals for increased retirement 

 benefits for referees. These proposals were considered by the full 

 committee and a sub-committee has been appointed­
     (1) 	To determine and recommend to the full committee
          whether items of legislation and the administration of
          referees in bankruptcy shall be based on a policy of ref­
          erees being officers of the courts in the same sense as
          other supporting personnel, such as clerks, or whether
          they should be considered as being in a different category
          and more nearly equivalent to judges, and
     (2) To consider, in the light of the sub-committee's decision
          on the above items, pending legislation relating to retire­
          ment, salaries and terms of office of referees in bankruptcy.
 These studies were approved by the Conference.
             Improvements in Bankruptcy Procedures                           (
     The Committee reported that a concentration of trustee ap­
  pointments and appointments of attorneys for trustees in certain
  areas in violation of 11 U.s.c. 76(a), has been brought to its
  attention. The Administrative Office is carefully investigating
  the facts and is taking and will continue to take corrective action.
     In cooperation with the Department of Justice, the Adminis­
  trative Office is also inquiring into the administration of bank­
  ruptcy cases in certain districts in which there is clear evidence of
  laxity on the part of receivers, trustees and referees in observing
  the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act relating to the sale and dis­
  position of scheduled assets, the inventory and appraisal thereof,
  the audit of receivers' and trustees' reports and accounts by the
  referee, and compliance with the Bankruptcy Act and the General
  Orders relating to the handling of monies belonging to bankrupt
• estates.
     An examination of the statistical reports filed by the referees 

  in cases closed in the fiscal year 1959 has also disclosed many errors 

  in the computation and allowance of receivers' and trustees' com­
                                   29 

 missions and in the computation of the charges made for the ref­
erees' salary and expense funds. The Administrative Office pro­
 poses to audit all statistical reports of cases closed during the fiscal
year 1960 and to hold receivers, trustees and referees accountable
for any errors therein.
   Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
adopted the following policies with respect to these matters and
authorized and directed the Administrative Office to put them
into effect:
   (1) That in all cases where the creditors fail to elect a trustee,
any qualified person shall be eligible for appointment by the ref­
eree and such appointments shall be spread as widely as reason­
ably possible. Likewise, appointments of attorneys for trustees
should be apportioned among a number of persons so that no
monopoly of appointments or inordinate compensation will result.
   (2) That the referees shall cause a thorough audit to be made
of all accounts of receivers and trustees and require strict com­
pliance by them with all provisions of the Bankruptcy Act relat­
ing thereto.
   (3) That receivers, trustees and referees shall be held person­
ally accountable for any errors in the computation of receivers'
and trustees' compensation and charges for the referees' salary
and expense funds disclosed by an audit of statistical reports of
cases closed in the fiscal year 1960.
   On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference author­
ized the immediate release of the action of the Conference with
respect to the recommendations contained in the Committee's
report.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRA·
         TION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
   Chief Judge William F. Smith, Chairman of the Committee on
the Administration of the Oriminal Law, reported that the Com­
mittee, as reconstituted by the Chief Justice in April, was in the
process of being reorganized. An inventory of all matters referred
to the Committee has been prepared and an initial business meet­
ing will be held in October. Pursuant to the direction of the
Conference at its March 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 33) the
National Legal Aid Society and the New York Legal Aid Society
                                30 


have been invited to appear before the Committee at the October
meeting to present their views on the proposal to authorize grants
to Legal Aid Societies and other organizations providing free legal
services to indigent persons accused of crime in the United States
courts.
   Chief Judge Smith also reported that the Chief Justice had
assigned to the Committee the study of the entire system of United
States Commissioners which was suggested to the Conference by
Congressman Celler in March (Conf. Rept., p. 4).
   On motion of Chief Judge Prettyman, the Conference called
to the attention of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law the problem of the waiver by the Juvenile Court
of the District of Columbia to the District Court of jurisdiction
over juvenile offenders in the District of Columbia.
   The Conference referred to the Committee on the Administra­
tion of the Criminal Law the recommendation of the Judicial Con­
ference of the Third Circuit that mandatory sentences in criminal
cases be abolished and the recommendation of the Judicial Con­
ference of the District of Columbia Circuit that mandatory capital
punishment be abolished in the District of Columbia.

REPORT ON THE PILOT INSTITUTE ON SENTENCING
   Chief Judge William J. Campbell, Chairman of the Institute
on Sentencing, reported that the Pilot Institute, authorized by
the Conference in March 1959 (Conf. Rept., p. 33), was held in
conjunction with the Seminar on Protracted Cases at the Univer­
sity of Colorado on July 16 and 17. There were in attendance
about 75 persons, including circuit and district judges, members of
Congress, staff members of Congressional Committees, representa­
tives of the Administrative Office, the Department of Justice, the
Department of the Treasury, the Department of the Army and
federal law enforcement agencies, and members of the Advisory
Corrections Council.
   The program for the Institute was developed by a planning
committee assisted by Professor Frank Remington of the Univer­
sity of Wisconsin School of Law, who also developed a desk book
on sentencing for the use of the participants in the Seminar.
Copies of the desk book and of the formal papers presented at th~
Institute were made available to the members of the Conference.
                                 31 

   Judge Campbell further reported that a questionnaire on vari­
ous aspects of the Institute had been circulated among the parti­
cipants. On the basis of the replies thereto, the following
recommendations were submitted to the Conference:
   (1) That future sentencing institutes be held from time to time
on a national level, in addition to institutes on a circuit level, as
contemplated by the authorizing legislation.
   (2) That participation: be specifically limited to judges, assisted
only by such experts in the field of sentencing as the judges them­
selves, in collaboration with the Administrative Office, may
determine.
   (3) That the present committee of judges assigned to the pilot
institute be discharged.
   (4) That future work on the sentencing problem be referred to
th~ Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.
   (5) That there be created in the office of the Director of the
Administrative Office a staff position, with necessary supporting
personnel and funds, to which would be assigned the responsibility
of preparing agenda and assisting in providing experts for future
sentencing institutes on both national and circuit levels and in
correlating this work for the Committee on the Administration of
the Criminal Law.
   (6) That the Attorney General be requested to create a staff
position in the Department of Justice to discharge the responsibili­
ties in connection with sentencing institutes which are placed on
the Attorney General, and that sufficient funds be allocated to
permit collaboration with the Administrative Office and the Judi­
cial Conference, as the statute contemplates.
   These recommendations were approved by the Conference.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL STATISTICS
   Chief Judge Charles E. Clark, Chairman of the Committee on
Judicial Statistics, presented the report of the Committee. He
stated that during the past year there had been considerable com­
ment and some criticism of the judicial statistics prepared and
published by the Administrative Office. In view of these com­
ments, the Committee desired again to emphasize its basic objec­
tive of securing and setting forth reliable, impartial information
as to the actual operation of the federal judicial establishment. In
                                 32 

general, the Committee was of the opinion that the statistics re­
ceived by the Administrative Office are adequate, but that greater
use of the data should be made in the direction of the preparation
and dissemination of more detailed information as to individual
districts.
   The Committee called attention to Table C 3a., appearing in
the Annual Report of the Director for the first time this year,
which shows the number of civil cases pending at the end of the
year in each district court by nature of suit. The report of the
Committee was received by the Conference and ordered to be
circulated to all circuit and district judges for their information.

     REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PRE-TRIAL
                  PROCEDURE
   Chief Judge William J. Campbell, in the absence of Chief Judge
Murrah, Chairman of the Committee, presented the report of the
Committee. The Conference considered the suggestion of the
Committee that it be declared the sense of the Conference that an
order, report, or copy of the transcript should be filed following
the pre-trial conference which contains the agreements and stip­
ulations of the parties and which shall control the subsequent          '
course of the action unless modified at the trial to prevent manIfest
injustice. After a full discussion the Conference directed that
the proposal, together with the other recommendations contained
in the Committee's report, be referred back to the Committoo for
further study in the light of the discussions in the Conference.
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION 

             OF THE JURY SYSTEM 

  Chief Judge Harry E. Watkins, Chairman of the Committee on
the Operation of the Jury System, submitted the report of the
Committee.
         TRAVEL AND SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE OF JURORS

  Chief Judge Watkins reported that it was the view of the
Committee that the subsistence allowance of jurors who are re­
quired to remain overnight should be increased from $7.00 to
$10.00 per day, and further, that the daily interim travel allow­
                                 33 

ance should be limited to what the juror would receive as sub­
sistence allowance. Each year since 1954 the Administrative
Office has circulated reports to all judges showing the districts
where excessive travel payments are being made and the amounts
thereof (See Conf. Rept., Sept. 1953, p. 17). The Committee
had hoped that these excessive payments would be reduced with­
out the necessity of a statute limiting the payment of daily travel
to the amount of the subsistence allowance. However, there has
been little improvement over the years. A draft of a bill to amend
28 U.S.c. 1871 to increase the subsistence allowance of jurors to
$10.00 per day and to limit daily interim travel expense payments
to the amount of the subsistence allowance, presented by the Com­
mittee, was thereupon approved by the Conference.

                            LEGISLATION

   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference took
the following action with respect to legislative proposals previously
considered by the Conference:
   (1) Reaffirmed its disapproval of the proposal contained in
H.R. 591 and H.R. 1095 to provide that in a civil case the number
of jurors required to constitute a jury and the number who must
agree for a valid verdict shall be determined by the law of the
state in which the action is tried.
   (2) Reaffirmed its approval of H.R. 4157 to increase the com­
pensation of jury commissioners from $5.00 to $10.00 per day with
no limit on the number of days of service.
   (3) Reaffirmed its approval of H.R. 4343 to provide a jury com­
mission for each United States district court to regulate its com­
pensation, to prescribe its duties, and for other purposes.
  Judge Watkins reported that H.R. 2978, 86th Congress, to au­
thorize additional peremptory challenges to multiple plaintiffs in
civil actions, as now allowed multiple defendants, had been ap­
proved by the President as Public Law 86-282.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ASSIGNMENT
        AND DESIGNATION OF JUDGES
  Circuit Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, Chairman of the Committee
on the Assignment and Designation of Judges, submitted on behalf
of the Committee a comprehensive report outlining the historical
                                  34 


  background of the assignment pra.ctice, the factQrs that limit the
  use of judges outside of their respective circuits, and an analysis
 of the procedural means that may he employed for correlating need
  with available judge power. He reported that the Committee
  conceives its task to be that of the preparation and submission of a
 plan for the transfer of judges, but that the Committee believes
 that study and experimentation are necessary before it can submit
 such a plan to the Conference.
    With the understanding that the procedures suggested below are
 to aid in the preparation of a plan for the assignment and desig~
 nation of judges the Committee recommended that:
    (1) All requests for the services of judges from without a circuit
 be presented to the Committee.
    (2) The Committee be authorized to request judges to serve
 outside their circuits and to seek the necessary consents for such
 serVIce.
    (3) The Committee be instructed to obtain information as to
 the need for and availability of judges for work outside their
 circuits, to analyze that information, and to report thereon to the
 Conference.
    (4) The Committee be directed to formulate procedural stand­
 ards and rules to be applied in the transfer of judges outside their
 circuits and to report its recommendations to the Conference for
 such action as it deems appropriate.
    (5) The Committee be directed to make recommendations to
 the Chief Justice relative to the transfer of judges for service out­
 side their circuits and to be of such other assistance to the Chief
 Justice in connection with the assignment and designation of
 judges as may be requested by him.
. The Conference discussed these recommendations fully and
agreed that the Committee should undertake this program. It
 was understood that when the Committee was sufficiently or­
ganized to put these procedures into effect, the members of the
Conference would be notified. Until then the existing procedures
for securing the assistance of judges outside of their own circuits
would be used.




                                                                         I,

      REPORT OF THE COMMITI'EE ON REVISION 

                  OF THE LAWS 

    Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on
 Revision of the Laws, submitted the Committee's report on
 legislative proposals considered by the Committee.
     (1) Con8ent judgment8 and decrees in antitru8t cases.-S. 1337,
 H.R. 6253, and H.R. 5942 would require that proposed consent
 decrees in antitrust cases be published in the Federal Register at
 least 30 days prior to their entry. H.R. 5942, which is substantially
 identical to H.R. 427, 85th Congress, approved by the Conference
 at its September 1957 session (Conf. Rept., p. 40), would make
 this requirement applicable to orders entered by a district court
 or the Federal Trade Commission and S. 1337 and H.R. 6253
 would make the requirement applicable also to all consent orders
 entered by any board or commission for the enforcement of the
 Clayton Act or the Federal Trade Commission Act. Upon rec­
ommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
 proposals contained in these three bills.
    (2) Admission of attorneys to practice in Courts of Appeals
and District Court8.-H.R. 8070 and H.R. 8208, 86th Congress,
would provide that any person who is a member in good standing
of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States and of the
highest court of any state, shall be eligible to practice before any
court of appeals or district court of the United States without
the necessity of making application therfor or of showing any
other qualifications. Similar proposals had been previously dis­
approved by the Conference at its September 1956 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 42) and at its March 1959 session (Con£. Rept., p. 31).
'I'he Committee pointed out that these bills would deprive the
lower federal courts of all effective control of the admission of
attorneys to their bar. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference disapproved both bills.
    (3) Registration and enforcement of 8upport orders in certain
8tate, territorial and other courts.-H.R. 5486, 86th Congress, is
substantially identical to bills previously considered by the Con­
ference at its September 1957 session (Conf. Rept., p. 37). The
Conference at that session disapproved the provisions of the pro­
posal which would provide for the registration and enforcement
of support orders by the federal district courts and expressed no
                                 36 

 opinion on the other features of the proposal. On recommendation
 of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its action on this
 proposal.
     (4) Arbitration Procedure-ludicial Revie'w of Questions of
 Law.-Judge Maris reported that H.R. 6322, 86th Congress, on
 which a request for the views of the Conference had been received
 from the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representa­
 tives, is substantially similar to H.R. 7577, 85th Congress, pre~
 viously considered by the Conference at its September 1958 ses~
 sion (Conf. Rept., p. 36). In addition to making a number of
 desirable and non-controversial improvements in the arbitration
 procedure provided by Title 9, United States Code, the bill previ~
ously considered contained two controversial provisions. One of
 these would require that no final award may be issued in a mari~
 time arbitration proceeding until after the arbitrators had sub~
mitted to the parties a statement in writing of their proposed
award. This provision is not included in H.R. 6322, but the
other controversial proposal to require the arbitrators at any time
before final award in the maritime arbitration, if so directed by
order of the district court, to state for the decision of the district
court any question of law arising in the course of the arbitration, (
or to state the award or a part thereof in the form of a special case,
has been retained. The Conference discussed the proposal fully,
and on motion of Chief Judge Sylvester J. Ryan disapproved H.R.
6322 on the ground that the bill is inconsistent with the basic
principles of arbitration, and that its enactment would result in
serious delay in arbitration procedure and in a substantially in­
creased burden upon the presently congested district courts in
the metropolitan port centers.
    (5) Service of Notice by Certified Mail.-H.R. 8542 and H.R.
8543, 86th Congress, would authorize the use of certified mail for
the transmission or service of matter now required by certain
federal laws to be transmitted or served by registered mail. With
regard to judicial proceedings, the bills would authorize the use
of certified mail in the service of notices now required to be given
by register-ed mail under 28 U.S.C. 2284 and 2410(b), and under
section 3491(c) of the Revised Statutes, 31 U.S.C. 232. These
provisions are contained in paragraphs (23), (24) and (32) of
section 1 (a) of the bills. On recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference approved these provisions.

   (6) Record on Judicial Review of Orders issued under the Fed­
eral Aviation Act of 1968 and the Food Additives Amendment of
1968.-The Congress in 1958, upon recommendation of the Con­
ference, enacted Public Law 85-791,72 Stat. 941, making uniform
the law relating to the record on review of agency orders, which
by specific amendment applied to all existing statutory provisions
for the review of agency orders by the courts of appeals. The
Committee reported, however, that at the time this recommenda­
tion was under consideration by Congress, two new Acts were
passed which made provision for judicial review of agency orders.
These were the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which superseded
the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, and the Food Additives Amend­
ment of 1958 which added to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos­
metics Act. H.R. 7847, 86th Congress, would bring the provisions
of these Acts, with respect to the record on judicial review of the
orders of the agencies concerned, into harmony with the uniform
law on that subject established by Public Law 85-791. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
bill.
               HABEAS CORPUS PROCEDURE
   Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
Habeas Corpus, informed the Conference that the bill, H.R. 3216
to amend 28 U.S.C. 2254 in reference to applications for writs of
habeas corpus by persons in custody pursuant to the judgment of
a state court, drafted by the Committee and approved by the Con­
ference (Conf. Rept., March 1959, p. 28), had passed the House
of Representatives and was now pending before the Senate Ju­
diciary Committee. He suggested, however, that a proposed
amendment to the last sentence of 28 U.S.C. 2254(b), as provided
in the bill, with respect to the constitution of the three-judge dis­
trict court, would be desirable. The Conference adopted the sug­
gestion and recommended that this sentence be amended to read
as follows: "At least one of the judges designated shall be a circuit
judge".
      REPORT ON THE STATUS OF LEGISLATION
 The Conference directed that the report prepared by the Ad­
ministrative Office on the status in the 86th Congress of legislative
                                38 

proposals considered by the Conference be brought up to date and
circulated to the members of the Conference.                     (
                                                                      '­

 INSTITUTE ON 	SENTENCING IN THE DISTRICT OF 

               COLUMBIA CIRCUIT 

  Pursuant to Public Law 85-752, 72 Stat. 845, the Conference
consented to the convening of an Institute on Sentencing in the
District of Columbia Circuit in accordance with the plan sub·
mitted by Chief Judge Prettyman.
  CONFERENCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE
  On motion of Chief Judge Prettyman, the Conference adopted
the following resolution with respect to the establishment of a
permanent Conference on Administrative Procedure:
       "Be it resolved, That this Conference (1) hereby ttpproves
    the action of the Judicial Conference of the District of Colum·
    bia Circuit proposing the establishment of a permanent Con­
    ference on Administrative Procedure, as set forth in the res·
    olution adopted by that Conference on May 21, 1959, and
    (2) authorizes the appointment of a Committee to consider (
                                                                    \~
    this matter and report to this Conference at its March 1960
    meeting.
                                .
     CLOSING OF CLERKS' OFFICES ON SATURDAYS
   The Conference referred to the Committee to be appointed to
study the rules of practice and procedure the proposal of the Ju­
dicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit to effect the
closing of the clerks' offices of the federal courts throughout the
country on Saturdays.
     PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURT OF
         APPEALS OF THE TENTH CIRCUIT
  At the request of Circuit Judge Pickett the Conference, pur­
suant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that terms for the Court of Ap­
peals for the Tenth Circuit at places other than Denver be pre­
termitted during the current fiscal year.
                                     39
           CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER SUBMISSION
       The Administrative Office submitted to the Conference a report
    on cases under submission in the courts of appeals and cases and
    motions under advisement in the district courts. The report listed
    29 cases under submission in the courts of appeals more than three
    months as of September 1, 1959, and 44 cases and motions which
    had been held under advisement by the district courts more than
    six months as of that crate. Where necessary, these will be brought
    to the attention of the circuit councils by the chief judges of the
    circuits.

     MAINTENANCE AND TRAVEL EXPENSES OF JUDGES
       The Director of the Administrative Office submitted for the
    approval of the Conference the interim travel regulations dated
    August 11, 1959 relating to the maintenance and travel expenses
    of judges issued by him pursuant to the provisions of Public Law
    86-138. The Director proposed, subject to the approval of the
    Conference, to issue permanent regulations requiring a judge who
    elects to claim reimbursement for actual expenses of subsistence to
(   list on his voucher under approximately five broad headings the
    actual expenses incurred by him for each calendar day up to $25.00.
    Any other unusual expense not included under one of the headings
    could be listed separately. Upon motion of Chief Judge Biggs the
    proposed regulations with respect to the subsistence expenses of
    judges were approved by the Conference.

                             COMMITTEES
       The Conference, on motion of Chief Judge Biggs directed that
    all existing Committees, including the Advisory Committee of
    the Conference, be continued and authorized the Chief Justice to
    reconstitute any Committee as he may see fit.
       The Conference declared a recess subject to the call of the Chief
    Justice.

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 

                          TO 

THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES 

                          BY 

     THE HONORABLE WILLIAM P. ROGERS 

         Attorney General of the United States 


                  Washington, D.C. 

                 September 16, 1959 

                              APPENDIX


      Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference:.
      It is always a privilege to attend the Judicial Conference of the
    United States and to render a report on matters of mutual interest.
    This Conference, quite properly, tends to focus its attention on
    measures to further improve the administration of justice. By
    continuing to unite our efforts, we may hope to make progress
    toward our objective of equal justice for aU under law.
    1. .Court Calendar8
       Problems of court congestion and delay still claim our primary
    attention. Although there has been a recent decrease in filings of
    civil cases and increased terminations, there were' nevertheless
    63,796 civil ca.ses pending on June 30, 1959-more than in any
    recent year except 1958, when 68,168 cases were pending.. This
    caseload continues to be a matter of serious concern.
       Certainly the judges have made considerable effort to meet
    the increasingly heavy workload in our Federal District Courts.
    On an average the individual judge terminated 236 civil cases in
    1959 as compared to 231 per judge in 1958 and to 169 in 1941-an
    increase over the past eighteen years of about 40% in the pro­
    ductivity of our Federal district judges. As a matter of fact, the
    average disposition for each judge may well be higher since these
    figures are based upon the number of authorized judges and not
    the number actually on duty.
       Special assignments made of additional judges to districts where
    calendars have been particularly congested have been most pro­
    ductive. Furthermore, the holding of special terms of court haa
    been helpful. For instance, the assignment of additional judges
    to the Eaatern District of New York during the Spring of this year
    enabled the Government to dispose of 132 of the 186 cases btigi­
    nallyset on this court calendar.
    . .The total of all cases and matters pending in the United States
    Attorneys Offices is now at an all-time low. The number of pend­
                                   (43)
(
                                 44 

iug government cases in the United States District Courts was
reduced during the past year in all categories except criminal
cases. It is significant that although the criminal cases tel'mi­
nated were greater than in the previous year, the terminations did
not keep abreast of the criminal cases filed. There were 7,727
eriminal cases pending at the end of fiscal 1959, an increase of
about 500 cases over the preceding year.
   The increase in pending criminal cases is attributable primarily
to the steady increase in the number of criminal matters being
received in United States Attorneys Offices and the lack of avail­
able judges in some districts.
   We are encouraged by the progress made in the reduction of
government cases. I am confident that we will continue to make
even greater progress during the coming year in our combined
efforts to reduce court congestion and bring about the disposition
of all cases within a reasonable time.
 II. 	Filling Judicial Vacancies
   At the close of the Congressional session just completed, the
President had sent nominations to the Senate for all vacancies
which had been in existence more than thirty days except one.
Forty were confirmed and four were left pending at the close of
the session. In addition, one district and one circuit vacancy have
come into existence since the first of the month. We thus open
the full term of court with practically a full complement of judges.
The cooperation of the Senate, particularly the Chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, has been of utmost value in bring­
ing about this satisfactory situation.
III. 	Antitrust Cases
   During the last fiscal year, criminal antitrust cases filed in­
creased from 22 to 41. Government civil cases dropped from 32
to 21. With respect to dispositions, the number of cases tried and
closed dropped from 12 to 10, but the number terminated with­
out trial increased from 37 to 55. It is our hope that we can con­
tinue to reduce the amount of court time consumed by the average
antitrust case. Last year only one antitrust trial exceeded 19
court days and was then classified as a protracted case. This case
lasted 37 court days but except for 1956 this is the least number
of trial days consumed by protracted antitrust cases for the last
ten years.
                                  45 

   The difference in efficiency between cases which are handled by
a single judge compared to those which are left to pass from one
judge to another in a multiple judge court continues to be striking.
For example, the Bethlehem- Youngstown case took only two years
from filing to final judgment, notwithstanding the complexities of
the evidentiary materials necessary for consideration. In another
merger case in which such an assignment was not made it took one
year to dispose of one set of interrogatories. Although we rec­
ognize the calendar problems of the courts, we hope that it will
be possible to increase the frequency of assignments of antitrust
cases to a single judge.
IV. Sentencing Institute
    In previous years I have discussed with you the disparities in
 the sentences given like offenders for like offenses and you may be
 sure that the Department welcomed the speed with which the first
 sentencing institute was organized under the 1958 law which made
 provision for them.
    The new law, as you know, also gave the courts some additional
 sentencing alternatives in their efforts to fit sentences more closely
 to the various factors involved in each case. Recognizing that
 there are about 27,000 convictions during each fiscal year, the new
 procedures cannot yet be considered in wide use. However, more
and more of the courts are applying them. Under the subsection
which authorizes the court to fix a minimum term (18 U.S.C. Sec.
4208 (a) (1)), sixteen courts during the 1959 fiscal year sentenced
38 defendants to maximum terms up to 15 years and to minimums
ranging from one month to five years, with nearly all the latter
for one year or less.
    The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 4208(a)(2) authorizing the court
to impose only the maximum term and to specify that the Board
of Parole shall determine parole eligibility have been used with
more frequency. Twenty-three courts disposed of 119 cases by
t,he maximum-only procedure. with the maximums ranging from
six months to more than 15 years.
    We have also watched with particular interest the use of the
diagnostic and observation procedure contained.in section 4208(b).
In effect, as you know, this section extends to a p~riod of three to
flix months the court's authority to' modify a sentence, an,d the
court can commit the defendant to one of our institutions for
                                 46 

intensive study over this period. This procedure furnishe'sthe
judge a summary of data concerning the defendant's mental and
emotional health, his physical condition. his social history, his
vocational or educational needs and any other information perti­
nent to the disposition of his case. It gives the court the benefit
of the views of the people who must deal with the prisoner and a
good idea whether the defendant needs institutional treatment
and how lengthy this treatment should be. Twenty-three courts
during the last fiscal year sent us 99 of these cases.
   You know of course that our institutional populations are in­
creasing rapidly, and a, number of you have expressed your con­
cern to us that the resulting overcrowding will adversely affect the
rehabilitation of the offenders you have committed. During the
past year or so we have taken a number of steps which will permit
us more effectively to carry out the sentences of the courts. We
have opened a new camp in South Carolina and another in Ari­
zona, which are expected to relieve to some extent the overcrowd­
ing of institutions in those areas. We have also reopened the
Sanstone, Minnesota. institution, and from now on offenders quali­
fied for medium or minimum custody will be committed directly to
it from the courts in that area. Two months ago we took over
from the Army the superlatively equipped institution at Lompoc,
California, and it will serve as a reception center for courts in that
area and as an institution for the confinement and rehabilitation
of young adult offenders. Finally, the Congress has given us funds
to begin construction of a new maximum custody institution in
southern Illinois, but it will be at least three years bdore this
institution can be occupied.
V. The Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure
   The Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure
and its Advisory Committee, established by the Act of September
2, 1958 (P.L.' 85-906) have made some progress since our last
Conference.
   As you know, the Commission is charged with the· study of
existing practices of judicial cooperation between the United States
and foreign countries, 'particularly in the service of judicialdocu­
rric:atsahroad, the ohtaining of testimony abroad by deposition
and letters rogatory, and in proving foreign law.· For the purpose
of making practice more efficient, expeditious and economical, the
                                47 

COmnlission is to draft international agreements, to be negotilited
by the Secretary of State, a.nd to recommend other legislation
found necessary. Since the Act of September 2, 1958 provided
that the Commission should terminate prior to December 31, 1959,
it has limited its activities to tasks which seemed capable of sub­
stantial accomplishment in that short time. Except for a pilot
project of examining our juridical relations with Austria and Japan,
a study of only the pertinent sections of the Federal Judicial Code,
the Criminal Code, and the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal
Procedure has been undertaken. The purpose of this limited pro­
gram is to recommend such revisions as will permit the maximum
use abroad of existing procedures which are now impossible of
utilization in many civil law countries. It is also contemplated,
if time permits, that model laws and rules fashioned after the
Federal revision and suitable for adoption by the States will be
drafted, and that statutes and rules designed to simplify proof of
foreign law will be considered.
   A Bill, H.R. 8461, providing for an extension of the life of the
Commission to December 31,1961 was enacted into law September
16, 1959 (P.L. 86-287).
VI. Legislation
(a) Omnibus judgeship bill
   As you know the Conference recommended the creation of 4
new circuit and 35 new district judgeships. It also recommended
that 4 temporary district judgeships be made permanent. Al­
though no bill incorporating these specific recommendations was
introduced in either House, other bills varying slightly from that
recommended by the Conference were introduced and received
vigorous support from the Department. During the closing days
of 'the session a judgeship bill creating 25 new judgeships was in­
troduced in the Senate and was reported by the Senate Judiciary
Committee. Unfortunately, it did not come to the Floor prior to
adjournment. It is, however, now in a position to receive prompt
consideration in January.
(b) Increasing per diem/or judges on travel status
  The Conference at its session in September, 1958 approved a blil
to.increase the maximum reimbursement subsistence expenses. for
judges on travel status from $15 to $25 a day.. The Department
                                 48 

supported that proposaL On August 7, 1959, it was enacted
into law.
(c) 	 Habeas corpus
  "'The Conference originally approved a proposal in March of 1955
dealing with habeas corpus applications to the United States
Courts by persons in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State
court. After further consideration the Conference made changes
in its proposal. It limited the grounds for habeas corpus appli­
cations by state prisoners to federal constitutional questions; pro­
vided that a state prisoner may not relitigate a federal constitu­
tional question previously adjudicated adversely to him by the
Supreme Court unless a controlling fact was not before the Su­
preme Court and could not with reasonable diligence be brought
before it; and provided for a hearing before a district court of 3
judges of all cases in which a writ is issued. The decision of the
district court. of 3 judges would be reviewable only on writ of
certiorari to the Supreme Court. The Department of Justice
supported the position of the Judicial Conference and the House
of Representatives passed a bill incorporating the views of the
Conference on July 29, 1959. This bill is now pending before
the Senate Judiciary Committee.                                      (
(d) 	Public defender
    The Department sponsored a bill in this Congress to provide
for court appointment of public defenders for indigent defendants.
This Conference on March 16, 1959 urged upon the Congress and
Mr. Olney gave strong support to the bills sponsored by the
Department in his testimony before the Committee on the Ju­
diciary in the House of Representatives on May 6, 1959. The
Senate passed the bill sponsored by the Department on May 20,
1959, but it has been impossible to date to receive its discharge by
the subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee to which it
was referred.
   The United States is a party in a major share of the cases actu­
ally tried in the federal courts each year. It is also involved in a
substantial part of the cases taken on appeal and those finally
heard in the Supreme Court. Whether we are in the role of plain­
tiff, prosecutor, petitioner or respondent, our sole objective is to
secure the prompt impartial administration of justice. This is an
                                                                       .,,
                                                                       ,~
                                  49 

    awesome responsibility which we share with you. We solicit your
    advice as to how we may better discharge these duties and would
    welcome the opportunity to report on any matter of interest to
    the Conference.
