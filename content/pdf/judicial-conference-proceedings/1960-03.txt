       Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman of the Committee
(   on Judicial Statistics, presented to the Conference the Committee
    recommendations for the creation of additional judgeships, based
    on the Committee's study of the judicial statistics and other fac­
    tors relating to the need for additional judgeships. In making
    these recommendations, the Committee gave consideration in each
    instance to the effect on the judicial business of each district court
    of the Act of July 25, 1958 curtailing the jurisdiction of the district
    courts in diversity of citizenship and certain federal question cases.
    Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr. advised the Conference that the Com­
    mittee on Court Administration concurred fully in the recommen­
    dations of the Statistics Committee except that it recommended
    one additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
    Circuit in addition to that heretofore recommended by the Con­
    ference. At the request of Chief Judge Richard T. Rives of the
    Fifth Circuit and Judge Ben C. Connally, the Conference also con­
    sidered proposals for the creation of additional judgeships in the
    Southern District of Florida and the Southern District of Texas.
       After a full consideration of the Committee reports and of the
    views of its members, the Conference voted to recommend the
    creation of the following additional judgeships not heretofore
    recommended by the Conference:
       One additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
       One additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
       One additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
       One additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
       One additional judgeship for the District of Puerto Rico
       One additional judgeship for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the first
        vacancy occurring thereafter not to be filled.
       One additional judgeship for the Southern District of Florida
       One additional judgeship for the Southern DistrIct of Texas
       One additional judgeship for the District of Nevada, the first vacancy occur­
        ring thereafter not to be filled.
       The Conference also recommended the creation of one addi­
    tional judgeship for the Middle District of Tennessee and one
    additional judgeship for the Western District of Tennessee in lieu
    of a roving judgeship for the two districts previously recom­
    mended. All other recommendations for the creation of addi­
    tional judgeships previously made by the Conference including the
    creation of an additional judgeship for the Western District of
    Texas, were renewed.
L
                                        4

   The Conference granted leave to the Committees on Judicial
Statistics and Court Administration to consider further the need
for additional judgeships for the District of Alaska, the District
                                                                                      r
of Arizona, the Southern District of California, and the Western
District of Missouri and the proposal to make permanent the
existing temporary judgeship in the District of Utah.
   Noting the action of the sub-committee of the House Judiciary
Committee in reporting a judgeship bill which does not include
some of the judgeships recommended by the Conference, the Con­
ference adopted a resolution urging that the additional judgeships
recommended by the Conference and omitted from the bill, to­
gether with the additional recommendations made by the Confer­
ence at this session, be reconsidered.

    District of Georgia and the District of New Mexico be made
    permanent.
      The Conference also recommends that the existing roving judge..
(   ship in the State of Washington be made a judgeship for the West­

       REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
       Chief Judge William J. Campbell, Chairman of the Committee
    on the Budget, reported that the members of the Committee had
    appeared before the subcommittee of the Committee on Appropria­
    tions of the House of Representatives in support of the budget for
    the judiciary for the fiscal year 1961, which was approved by the
    Conference at its September 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 6). As
    soon as the action of the Committee on Appropriations of the
    House of Representatives is made known, the Committee will
    meet to con~der what request, if any, should be made to the Appro­
    priations Committee of the Senate.
      The supplemental appropriations for the operation of the courts
    for the fiscal year 1960, although less than the amount requested,
    have been approved by the House of Representatives. These are
    considered sufficient to carryon the activities of the courts for the

balance of the current fiscal year and the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office, Mr. Olney, has so stated in a letter to Senator Carl    fl.
                                                                        ~


Hayden, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   To assist the Budget Committee and the Administrative Office in
the preparation of the budget estimates for the judiciary for the
fiscal year 1962, the Chief JudgeS of the 13 metropolitan districts
have been requested to submit statements of anticipated increases
or decreases in requirements for that fiscal year. These reports will
be analyzed by the staff of the Administrative Office and presented
to the Budget Committee at its next meeting.
   Chief Judge Campbell also reported that the Administrative
Office has been advised by the General Services Administration that
it will not be able to provide furniture for the United States courts
in the new buildings being constructed by the General Services
Administration which are expected to be completed during the
fiscal year 1961. The estimated cost of the new furniture required
in seven locations is $142,400. Information on the cost of the fur­
niture for a new building in Charleston, West Virginia, scheduled
for completion in April 1961 is not yet available. On motion of
Chief Judge Campbell, the Conference authorized the Director of
the Administrative Office to request additional appropriations of
$142,400 for furniture and furnishings for the courts for the :fiscal
year 1961 either in the form of a supplemental appropriation or as
an amendment to the 1961 appropriations bill.

JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORT­
  ING PERSONNEL AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT
  ADMINISTRATION
   Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
Supporting Personnel and of the Committee on Court Administra­
tion, submitted to the Conference the joint report of the two
Committees.
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  The Committees reported that they concurred fully in the rec­
ommendations of the Committee on Judicial Statistics for the
creation of additional judgeships, and recommended in addition
thereto, that there be created an additional circuit judgeship for
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which

                                                                        (,
                                       7
     would increase the number of judgeships for that court to nine.
{    Conference action with respect to these recommendations is shown
     above.
                         DEPUTY CLERKS OF COURT

        At the request of the Committees the Conference directed the
     Administrative Office to study the grade classifications of the chief
     deputy clerks and other personnel in the clerks' offices of the courts
     of appeals and to report to the Committees prior toO their next
     meeting.
        The Conference at its September 1958 session (Conf. Rept.,
     p. 14), directed the Administrative Office to study the differences in
     duties and responsibilities of deputy clerks of court in charge of
     divisional offices and to report to the Committees on Supporting
     Personnel and Court Administration, as to whether or not there
     should be grade differentials in these positions. The Committees
     reported that the Administrative Office had submitted a report
     recommending the adoption of the following resolution:
            Resolved, That there shall continue to be grade differentials
         in the positions of deputy clerks in charge of divisional offices;
         that the present grade GS-lO ceiling for deputy clerks as pro­
(        vided by the classification plan for clerks' offices of district
         courts shall be raised to provide a special ceiling of grade
         08-11 for deputy clerks in charge of the larger independently
         operated divisional offices, and that wherever warranted com­
         parable grade raises shall be approved for deputies in charge
         of other (smaller) independent offices, proportionately scaled
         downward from the new ceiling of grade GS-11; that substan­
         tiallatitude shall be allowed the Administrative Office in clas­
         sifying these positions because of the many variations in the
         organization of clerks' divisional offices and the distribution of
         responsibilities among the occupants; that, since funds are not
         presently available, the upgradings resulting from this deter­
         mination shall be put into effect as soon as funds do become
         available, on a gradual basis if necessary; and that such up­
         gradings shall not serve to exclude the deputy clerks concerned
         from any future general reclassification of positions in clerks'
         offices.
       Upon recommendation of the Committees, the resolution was.
     approved by the Conference.
(.
                                  8
  On motion of Chief Judge Pine, the Committee on Supporting
Personnel was directed to make a study of the grade clrussifications
of deputy clerks in charge of divisions in courts not having geo..,
graphical divisions and to report thereon at the next session of the
Conference.
                         COURT REPORTERS

   The Committees reported that they had considered a request
of Chief Judge Sylvester J. Ryan for an additional court reporter
for the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York and were of the view that the authorization for such
additional reporter was a prime necessity. On recommendation
of the Committees, the Conference authorized the employment
of an additional court reporter for the Southern District of New
York at the same salary as the other reporters in the district.
 , The Committees also reported that since the last meeting of
the Conference, the Administrative Office had authorized the posi~
tion of reporter-law clerk for Senior Judge William J. Barker of
the Southern District of Florida, who has continued to perform
substantial judicial duties. At present there is a vacancy in a
judicial position in this district, which, when filled, will require
the services of an additional court reporter. Upon recommenda­           (j
tion of the Committ:res, the Conference approved the action of the
Administrative Office and authorized an additional full-time court
reporter for the Southern District of Florida, to be appointed when
the existing judicial vacancy is filled.
   Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that Judge Wal­
ter H. Hodge of the District of Alaska had.. requested authority
to employ a court reporter at the maximum statutory salary of
$7,095 per annum. Judge Hodge pointed out that the reporter
he intends to appoint received this salary as the court reporter­
secretary to a former district judge of the Territory of Alaska
and that his secretarial duties in that position were almost nil.
The Committees recommended that the court reporter for the
District of Alaska be clrussified as a non-metropolitan area re­
porter, but that a salary of $7,095 be approved for this reporter
in lieu of overseas cost-of-living differential received by other fed­
eral employees in Alaska. This recommendation was approved
by the Conference.
                                      9

       The Committees also reported that the United States District
(    Court for the Southern District of California, which has eleven
     active judges and one senior judge, who continues to perform sub­
     stantial judicial services, has only eleven authorized court reporter
     positions. An additional reporter is presently serving the court
     on a temporary per diem basis. Upon recommendation of the
     Committee, the Conference authorized a twelfth reporter position
    for the district at the metropolitan rate of $7,095 per annum.
       The Conference was advised by the Committees that the survey
     of court reporters being conducted by the Administrative Office,
     with the assistance of the Bureau of the Budget, will be completed
    ·in March. Mter its completion, arrangements have been made
     for its consideration by a subcommittee, appointed by the Chair­
     man, and by the Committees, with a view toward making a report
     and recommendations to the Conference at its September session.
                     CoURT CRIERS AND MESSENGERS

        After a full consideration of the present salary classification
     for court criers, the Committees have concluded that the classi­
c    fication of Grade GS-4 is insufficient and. that the classification
     for court criers should be changed to Grade GS-5. Since many
     criers have8Jready completed all possible within-grade promotions
    -and others have reached the final longevity step in Grade GS:..4,
    ·the Committees recolnmended that, as soon as funds are available,
    ·each crier be· placed ill a position in Grade GS-5 that would be
    .one full step above his present salary level. - The recommendation
    ·of the Committees was approved by the Conference.
        Upon recommendation of the Committees, the Conference also
    -requeSted the' Administrative Office to make a study of the salary
     status of the 'present messengers employed in the United States
     Courts of Appeals and to report as soon as possible to the
     Coinrriitte~s in respect thereto.

                                SECRETARIES

      The Co:minittee of Ohief Judges of Multiple-Judge Distriet
    Courts had recommended to the' Committee on Supportmg Per­
    sonnelthat the qualification standards for secretaries to judge~,
    Grade GS-lO, be amended to reduce the requirement of ten-years'
(
                                  10 

service as a federal judge's secretary to five years or its equiva­
lent. This proposal had been previously considered at the Sep­
tember 1959 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 10). The
Committees, however, were of the view that the matter should
have further consideration, and have asked the Adnrinistrative
Office to study the proposal and to report to the O:>mmittees. The
Conference granted leave to the Committees to consider the matter
further and to report thereon at the next session of the Conference.

                  OTHER SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

   Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the Conference
directed the Adnrinistrative Office to proceed a.s expeditiously as
possible with a survey and the preparation of a report with respect
to the appropriate grading and cla.ssification of personnel in the
clerks' offices, the probation offices, and the referees' offices of the
district courts to the end that a proper and equitable classification
be made for the various positions in these offices.

  The Conference at its March 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 14)
had referred to the O:>mmittees on Court Administration and Sup­
porting Personnel the request of Judge Edward J. Dimock with
regard to the employment of interpreters on a contract or per
diem basis and the payment of fees of psychiatrists by the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The proposal is currently under consideration by the Committee
on Supporting Personnel and the Conference granted leave to the
Committee to report at a later session of the Conference.

FEEs AND MILEAGE OF WITNESSES IN HABEAS CORPUS PRocEEDINGS

  The Conference· granted leave to the Committees on Supporting
Personnel and Court Administration to consider further the pro­
posal to provide for the payment of fees and mileage of witnesses
in habeas corpus proceedings brought by persons authorized to
proceed in forma pauperis, which was referred to the Committees
at the September 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 20).
                                                                           (

                    NATIONAL PARK CoMMISSIONERS

       The United States District Court for the District of Arizona,
    pursuant to Public Law 85-258, has appointed a special commis­
    sioner for Grand Canyon National Park at an annual salary of
    $5,950, subject to the approval of the Judicial Conference. This
    is the same salary paid to the National Park commissioners in the
    large national parks. The Committees were of the view that this
    is an appropriate salary for the special commissioner, and upon
    their recommendation the Conference approved the salary of the
    special commissioner as fixed by the district court.

                 AUDITS OF ACCOUNTS OF CoURT OFFICERS

       It had been brought to the attention of the Committees by Chief
    Judge Sylvester J. Ryan that the audits of accounts of officers of
    the courts by the examiners of the Department of Justice occur at
    relatively long intervals of three to four years. The Director of
    the Administrative Office had informed the Committees that the
    Assistant Attorney General, Administrative, concurred in the view
    that there should be mote frequent audits of accounts. The Com­
(   mittees therefore recommended to the Conference that it request
    the Department of Justice to make annual audits. of the accounts
    of the officers of the courts. This recommendation was approved
    by the Conference.

                  STANDING MAsTERS UNDER RULE        53
      Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the proposal of
    Judge John W. Clancy to provide for standing masters under
    Rule 53, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which had been referred
    to the Committees by the Conference at its March 1959 session
    (Conf. Rept., p. 14) was referred to the standing Committee of
    the Confere:p.ce on Rules of Fractice and Procedure.

      The Committees reported that they had considered the pro­
    posal to hold a seminar for newly appointed judges (Conf. Rept.,

posal of Chief Judge Murrah and recommended to the Conference
that it authorize such a seminar. The Committees' recommenda­
tion was approved by the Conference.
           ARBI1'RATION OF AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT CASES

    S. 2415, 86th Congress, to provide a method for the arbitration
 of automobile accident cases pending in the United States district
 courts had been referred to the Committee on Court Administra­
 tion at the September 1959 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept.,
 p. 20). The Committee reported that it had the matter under
 consideration, hut at the present time insufficient information is
 available to enable it to make a recommendation with respect to
 the ,bill; despite the fact that the Committee on the Judiciary of
 theU'nited States Senate has requested the views of the Con­
 ference with respect to the proposal. The Conference thereupon
'granted leave to the Committee to consider the matter further

    SAl;.tARIE8, TERMS OF OFFICE AND RETIREMENT OF REFEREES.

   Judge Phillips reported that a subcommittee, consisting of Dis­
trict Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman, Circuit Judge Bailey
Aldrich and District Judge Albert V. Bryan, appointed by him to
consider various proposals relating ro the salaries, terms of office,
and retirement of referees, had submitted its findings. Mter
careful consideration of these findings and of the subcom.:mittee
report consideroo as a whole, the Committee recommended to the
Conference each of the following proposals of the suboo:tn:It!.ittee:
   (1) That a more liberal retirement plan for referees be provided
based on a contribution of71;2 percent of the base pay ro be oon-.
tributed by the employee and a matching 71;2 percent contribu­
tion from the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund by the employ­
ing agency, and that compulsory retirement. at age 75 be made a
part of the liberalized retirement for referees.
                                                                                   (
                                       15 

        (2) That the term of office of a full-time referee be increased
(	   from 6 years to 12 years; the term of office of a part-time referee to
     remain at 6 years, as at present.
        (3) That the maximum salary of a part-time referee be in­
     creased from $7,500 to $8,500 per annum and the maximum salary
     of a full-time referee be increased from $15,000 to $17,500 per
     annum.
        The Conference considered fully each of these three proposals
     and voted to approve the program with reference to the retirement
     plan for referees and to the terms of office for full-time referees.
     However, the proposal to increase the maximum salary of full­
     time and part-time referees was referred back to the Committee
     for further study.
                                 LEGISLATION

        The Committee reported to the Conference concerning the fol­
      lowing legislative proposals considered by the Committee:
        (1) H.R. 4150, to amend Section 2aof the Bankruptcy Act (11
      U.S.C. 11a) to give the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to determine
     the dischargeability of provable debts.-This bill had been con­
     sidered previously by the Conference and approved (Conf. Rept.,
     March 1959, p. 18). However, the House Judiciary Committee
     was of the view that the right of a creditor to sue the bankrupt
     on a debt, which is alleged to be nondischargeable, in a court other
     than the bankruptcy court should be preserved, and that addi­
     tional jurisdiction for the bankruptcy court to determine the effects
     of a discharge should be authorized only where both the creditor
     and the bankrupt consent to have the bankruptcy court decide the
     question. Accordingly, the House Judiciary Committee amended
     a portion of Section 1 of the bill to read as follows:
          Upon application of the bankrupt and the creditor concerned
          determine. the dischargeability or nondischargeability of all
          provable debts.
     The bill passed the House on September 7, 1959.
        It was the view of the Committee that this amendment, to a
     large degree, nullifies the objective of the bill, and that upon the
     application of either the bankrupt or the creditor, the bankruptcy
     court should have jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability
     of all provable debts. Accordingly, the Committee recommended
l    that the word "and" in the above quoted portion of the bill be
                                 16 

 amended by inserting in lieu thereof the word "or" and that the 

 bill, as so amended, be approved by the Conference. The Confer~ 

 ence thereupon reaffirmed its approval of the bill as thus amended. 

    (2) H.R. 4346, to amend the Bankruptcy Act to' limit the use
 of false financial statements as a bar to discharge, by eliminating
 as a ground for the complete denial of a discharge the obtaining of
 money or credit by a false financial statement issued by a non­
 business bankrupt.-While the obtaining of money or property on
~redit through the issuance of a false financial statement under
 the provisions of the bill is no longer to be a ground for the com­
 plete denial of a diwharge to a nonbusiness bankrupt, the bill
makes it clear that the particular debt incurred as a result of a
false statement may not be diwharged under Section 17 of the
Bankruptcy Act. The bill passed the House of Representatives
with minor amendments on September 7,1959 and is now pending
before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Upon recommendation
of the Committee, the Conference approved the amendments now
proposed and reaffirmed its approval of the bill, as amended by the
House of Representatives.
   (3) H.R. 4850, to amend Sections 60b, 67e and 70e of the Bank­
ruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 96b, 107e, and 110e) to give the bankruptcy
court summary jurisdiction in actions 1,1wolving preferences, liens
                                                                         o
and fraudulent transfers, and the trustee's title to property.­
Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference re­
affirmed its approval of the bill. (Conf. Rept., March 1959, p. 19).
   (4) H.R. 6556, to amend Section 39c of the Bankruptcy Act
(11 U.S.C. 67c) to clarify the time for filing a petition to review
a referee's order.-The Conference at its September 1959 session
 (Conf. Rept., p. 25) approved the suggestion of the Committee
that H.R. 6556 be amended by inserting after the second sentence
thereof the following;
      Unless the person aggrieved shall petition for review of such
      order within such 10-day period, or any extension thereof,
      the order of the referee shall become final.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference re­
affirmed its approval of the bill with the above amendment.
   (5) S. 2052 and H.R. 6557, to amend Section I,.8c of the Bank­
ruptcy Act ( 11 U.s.C. 76c) to increase the closing fee of the trustee
in bankruptcy from $5.00 to $10.00, and to amend Section 132 of      0
                                        17
      the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.532) to require payment of a filing
(	    fee of $120.00 instead of $100.00 upcm the filing of an original
      Chapter X petition.-The increase of $20.00 in the filing fee for a
     Chapter X petition would provide the sum of $50.00 for the fees
     required under Sections 400, 48c and 52a of the Bankruptcy Act
      (11 U.S.C. 68c, 700, 80a), in the event an adjudication is entered.
     S. 2052 passed the Senate on August 24, 1959. Upon the recom­
     mendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the bilL
         (6) H.R. 6816, to amend Section 57a of the Bankruptc.y Act
      (11 U.S.C. 93a) and 18 U.S.C. 152 to eliminate the requirement
      that proofs of claim be verified under oath.-The Conference at
     its September 1959 session (Gonf. Rept., p. 25) recommended that
     H.R. 6816 be amended by adding the following sentence:
           A proof of claim filed in accordance with the requirements of
           the Bankruptcy Act, the General Orders of the Supreme Court,
           and the official forms, even though not verified under oath,
           shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and
           amount of the claim.
     On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed
     its approval of the bill as thus amended.
         (7) H.R. 7242, to amend Sections 1 (29), 57j, 64a, 67b, 67c and
     70c of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 1(29), 93j, 104a, l07b, l07c
     and 11 Oc), relating to priority claims, statutory liens and title to
     property.-This bill, which supersedes H.R. 4158 previously ap­
     proved by the Conference (Conf. Rept., March 1959, p. 18), pre­
     serves the present position of the costs of administration and wages
     in the distribution of the assets of a bankrupt and at the same time
     enables valid contractual liens, such as chattel mortgages, condi­
     tional sales contracts, trust receipts and the like, to retain their po­
     sition ahead of statutory liens on personal property unaccompanied
     by possession. The bill is identical with H.R. 4158 except for the
     addition in the first line after the word "Debts" of the phrase
     "whether or not secured by lien". This phrase was contained in
     a bill previously approved by the Conference (Conf. Rept., Sept.
     1957, p. 22). On recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
     ference reaffirmed its approval of the proposals contained in H.R.
     7242 and recommended its passage.
        (8) H.R. 7726, to eliminate the present requirement contained
     in Section 678 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 1078) that copies
                                  18 

 of petitions, notices and orders in Chapter XIII (Wage Earners)
 proceedings be sent to the Secretary of the Treasury, and to pro-        r
 vide in lieu thereof that the notice of the first meeting of creditors
 be given to the District Director of Internal Revenue for the
 district in which the court is located and to the Comptroller Gen­
 eral of the United States, a.s provided in Section 58e.-This bill
 would make the requirement8 for mailing notices in Chapter XIII
 cases to certain officers of the Government similar to those pro­
vided by Section 500 in straight bankruptcy cases. Section 58e
 also requires that a notice of the first meeting of creditors be
mailed to the head of any department, agency or instrumentality,
 whenever the schedules of the bankrupt disclose a debt due to the
 United States acting through any department, agency or instru­
mentality thereof.
   The Committee reported that it had been informed that the
Comptroller General did not desire to receive the notice of the
first meeting of creditors in Chapter XIII cases, or in any other
bankruptcy case, except where the bankrupt was engaged in the
business of transporting persons or property. He therefore sug­
gested that the reference to the Comptroller General contained in
H.R. 7726 be eliminated, and further, that an additional section          ("
be added to the bill that would amend Section 58e of the Bank­
ruptcy Act to require that notices in straight bankruptcy cases be
sent to him only when the bankrupt has been engaged in the
transportation business.
   The Committee concurred generally with the proposal of the
Comptroller General, but was of the view that notices involving
bankrupts engaged in the transportation business should be. sent
to the Comptroller General only Hwhere it clearly appears on the
face of the petition" that the bankrupt has been engaged in such
business. The Committee accordingly recommended that the pres­
ent reference to the Comptroller General in H.R. 7726 be elimi­
nated and that the bill be amended by adding thereto the following
additional section:
         SEC. 2. Section SSe of the BankrUptcy Act, as amended
       (11 U.S.C. 94(e»), is amended by chan.ging the comma follow­
                             in
       ing the word ltlocated" the first sentence thereof to a period,
     . deleting the balance of 	that sentence, and substituting for 

       the deleted portion the following new sentence: 

                                                                          (
                                        19 

             In cases involving a bankrupt where it clearly appears on
(         the face of the petition that the bankrupt is or was engaged
          in the business of transporting persons or property, the court
          also shall mail, or cause to be mailed a copy of such notice to
          the Comptroller General of the United States.
          The Conference thereupon approved the recommendation of
      the Committee.
          (9) H.R. 1727, to amend Sections 334,367 and 369 of the Bank­
      ruptcy Act (11 U.s.C. 734,767 and 76,9) and to add a new Section
      355 to require claims to be fiW in Chapter XI (Arrangement)
      proceedings filed under Section 322, 'l..Vithin six months from the
      first date set for the first meeting of creditors as is now required by
      Section 57n in straight bankruptcy proceedings.-The Conference
      at its September 1959 session (Com. Rept., p. 26) directed that a
      further study be made of the proposal to .require the filing of claims
      in Chapter XI cases, which the Conference had previously ap­
      proved (Conf. Rept., March 1959, p. 23).
         It was the view of the Committee, after further study, that since
      Chapter XI cases frequently involve large and complicated ar­
     rangements, a8 well as relatively simple compositions or exten­
(	   sions, and that the debtor's schedules are frequently inaccurate as
      to the amounts of the debts listed, that the reasons for requiring
      the filing of claims in ordinary bankruptcy cases apply equally to
      Chapter XI proceedings. The Committee pointed out that
     debtors in Chapter XI proceedings are usually engaged in business
     and often will not know the precise amount due on each debt
     considering interest, carrying charges, discounts, rebates, refunds,
     returns for credit and the like. Further, if the debtor is left in
     possession, there may be no one to challenge the accuracy of
     claims, even though a creditors' committee has been appointed.
     It therefore seemed wise to the Committee to require claims to be
     filed in Chapter XI cases. Upon recommendation of the Commit­
     tee, the Conference reaffirmed its approval of the proposals con­
     tained in H.R. 7727.
         (10) H.R.8708, to amend Section 60d of the Bankruptcy Act
     (11 U.S.C.96d) to give the Bamkruptcy Court on its own motion,
     or on petition of the bankrupt made prior to the (JTanting of his
     discharge, jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of fees
     paid, or agreed to be paid, to his attorney for services rendered, or
c
                                 20

to be rendered.-The proposal contained in this bill, which super­
sedes H.R. 6352, had been previously considered and approved by
the Conference at its March 1959 session (Conf. Rept., pp. 20 and
21). On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference re­
affirmed its approval of the proposals embodied in H.R. 8708.
          APpOINTMENT OF RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES

   Judge Phillips informed the Conference that the study of the
appointments of receivers and trustees and the audit of statistical
reports of cases closed in the bankruptcy courts, commenced last
year by the Administrative Office with the approval of the Com­
mittee and the Conference (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1959, p. 28) had
disclosed a number of apparent violations of the monopoly statute
(11 U.S.C. 76a), as well as a laxity on the part of certain referees
and trustees in observing the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act
and the General Orders. The Committee was of the view that
this program should continue as a permanent part of the work of
the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office. The Con­
ference agreed with the Committee's view.                     .
   During the past year the Administrative Office has received sub-    (.':
stantial assistance from the examiners of the Department of
Justice, but because of the limited staff of examiners, regular
examinations of judicial offices are made only infrequently. As a
result they are ineffective, to a large degree, in bringing to the
attention of the Director in a timely manner situations which
should be corrected. The Committee was of the view that· a
larger staff of examiners was required to assist in this work and
recommended· that the Conference request the Director arid the
Budget Committee to take up the need for additional examiners
with the Department of Justice to the end that provision may be
made in the budget of the Department for an adequate staff
of ex~ners. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
           SCHEDULE OF    FEES   AND SPECIAL CHARGES

  The Committee recommended a revision in the schedule of
fees and charges, promulgated by the Conference, pursuant to
Section 40c of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 68c), which will
combine the charges to be made for the salaries and expenses of
                                            21 

     referees to reflect the consolidation of the referees' salary and ex~
     pense funds, which will become effective July 1, 1960. Both the
     consolidation of the salary and expense funds and the new schedule
     of fees and charges to be made by the referees will greatly simplify
     the work of the offices of the referees and clerks of court and will
     relieve the Administrative Office and the Treasury Department of
     a considerable burden of record keeping in accounting for this
     money. The Conference approved the revised schedule and di­
     rected that it be made effective july 1, 1960. The new schedule is
     as follows:
                         SCHEDULE OF FEES AND CHARGES

              JURY TRIALS BY REFEKEES IN BANKRUPTCY
                                                                                      (
   Judge Phillips called to the attention of the Conference the
inquiry of Senator James O. Eastland, Chairman, Committee on
the Judiciary of the United States Senate, with respect to the
legality of the conduct of jury trials by referees in bankruptcy.
The Conference considered the matter at length, and after a full
discussion, adopted the following resolution:
     Without expressing an opinion as to any question of law in·
     volved, it is the sense of the Judicial Conference that referees
     in bankruptcy should not preside upon jury trials of involun·
     tary petitions in bankruptcy; further, that this matter be
     referred to the standing Committee of the Conference on Rules
     of Practice and Procedure.
   The Director of the Administrative Office was instructed, simul·
taneously with the adoption of the resolution, to advise the Com..
mittee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate of the action
of the Conference.

                      HABEAS CORPUS PROCEDURE
          Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
        Habeas Corpus, informed the Conference that H.R. 3216, to
        amend 28 U.S.C. 2254 in reference to applications for writs of
        habeas corpus by persons in custody pursuant to the judgment of
        a State court, recommended by the Committee and approved by
        the Conference (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1959, p. 37), had passed the
        House of Representatives and was now pending before the Senate
        Judiciary Committee. The Committee is hopeful that final action
        on the bill will be taken at this session of Congress.

               REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE
              ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
          Chief Judge William F. Smith, Chairman of the Committee on
        the Administration of the Criminal Law, presented the report of
        the Committee.

              SETI'ING ASIDE CoNVICTIONS OF YOUTH OFFENDERS

           The Committee reported that it had considered fully the pro­
    (   posal to authorize the setting aside of the cqnviction of a youth
        offender prior to the expiration of the maxunum term of proba­
        tion, referred to it by the Conference at its March 1959 session
        (Conf. Rept., p. 33) and was of the view that the proposal should
        be enacted into law. The Committee presented a draft bill to
        amend the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. 5021, by adding
        thereto an additional paragraph to read as follows:
            Where a youth offender has been placed on probation by the
            court, the court may thereafter, in its discretion, uncondi­
J           tionally discharge such youth offender from probation prior
            to the expiration of the maximum period of probation there­
            tofore fixed by the court, which discharge shall automatically
            set aside the conviction, and the court shall issue to the youth
            offender a certificate to that effect.
          The Conference thereupon approved the draft bill presented by
        the Committee.

   Chief Judge Smith reported that there had been referred to the
Committee S. 2083 to abolish the mandatory capital punishment
provision of the District of Columbia murder statute. The Com­
                                                                                I

mittee also considered both the proposal of U.S. Attorney Oliver
Gasch to amend 18 U.S.C. 1111 to make the provisions of the
criminal code applicable to the District of Columbia and a draft
                                                                                I
                                                                                i
                                                                                ;
bill prepared by a Committee of the Judicial Conference of the
District of Columbia Circuit which would permit a jury to rec­
ommend life imprisonment. The Conference discussed these pro­
posals fully and upon the recommendation of the Committee
approved the draft bill prepared by the Committee of the District
of Columbia Circuit Conference.
     ApPEALS BY THE UNITED STATES IN CRIMINAL CASES

   There had been brought to the attention of the Committee
five separate bills, S. 1644, S. 1721, H.R. 4186, H.R. 9063, and
H.R. 9181, each of which contemplates the amendment of 18
U.S.C. 3731, to authorize an appeal by the United States from         (
an order suppressing evidence in a criminal case. The two bills
on which a hearing has been held by the House Judiciary Com­
mittee would authorize an appeal "from a decision entered before
or after the trial has begun, sustaining a motion to suppress evi­
dence, if the United States Attorney certifies and the court is
satisfied that such decision involves a controlling question of law
in that the prosecution is unable to proceed with its case without
the suppressed evidence." The Committee members had grave
doubts as to the constitutionality of any provision granting the
right of appeal to the Government in a criminal case from a deci­
sion entered (lafter trial has begun," but agreed to consider the
problem further. However, the Committee did recommend the
draft of a bill which reserves to the Government a right of appeal
Hfrom an interlocutory order entered prior to trial of a criminal
case sustaining a motion to suppress either tangible or intangible
evidence."
   The Conference considered the proposal at length and directed
that it be referred back to the Committee for further study in the
light of the discussions in the Conference.
                                                                          )
                                            25
             The Committee also expressed the view that the need for an
          appeal from a suppression order entered after trial has commenced
          may be due largely to the dilatory tactics of defense counsel. The
          Committee therefore suggested that the Standing Committee on
          the Rules of Practice and Procedure consider the present effect
          of Rule 41 (e), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in respect to
          the discretion of the Court to entertain a motion to suppress evi­
          dence after trial has commenced. The Conference thereupon re­
          ferred the matter to the Committee on Rules of Practice and
          Procedure.
                              INSTITUTE OF CoRRECTIONS

            Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference ap­
          proved H.J. Res. 4, 86th Congress, to authorize the Attorney Gen­
          eral to establish an Institute of Corrections for the training and
          instruction in the field of correctional methods and techniques of
          correction personnel selected by States and their municipal
          subdivisions.
              CRIMINAL OFFENSE        NOT CoMMlTI'ED IN ANY DISTRICT
             S. 1642 and H.R. 4154, 86th Congress, which are substantially
     (	   alike, would amend 18 U.S.C. 3238 to provide as follows:
               The trial of all offenses begun or committed upon the high
               seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular state
               or district, shall be in the district in which the offender, or
               anyone of two or more joint offenders, is arrested or is first
               brought; but if such offender or offenders are not so arrested
               or brought into any dist,rict, an indictment or information may
               be. filed in the district of the last known residence of the of­
               fender or of anyone of two or more joint offenders, or
               if no. such residence is known the indictment or information
               may be filed in the District of Columbia.
I
,)          Upon reCommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
          proved these bills.
                       PuNISHMENT FOR CoNTEMPT OF COURT
             The Committee recommended that the proposals contained in
          S. 1231, H.R. 2262 and H.R. 5115, 86th Congress, to provide for
          trial by jury of criminal contempt cases, which would have the
     (    effect of limiting the contempt powers of courts, be disapproved.
          This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
                                 26 

      TIME FOR NOTING AN ApPEAL IN A (,)UMINAL CASE

   Judge Bazelon, a member of the Committee on the Administra­
tion of the Criminal Law, had requested that the Committee con­
sider an amendment to Rule 37(a) (2), Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, to permit the enlargement of the time for noting an
appeal in a criminal case, where it was determined that the failure
to file the notice of appeal within the time specified was ascribable
to "excusable neglect". Upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee the Conference referred the proposal to the Standing Com­
mittee of the Conference on Rules of Practice and Procedure.

 ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE CRIMINAL CODE

   Chief Judge Smith reported that the Committee had considered
H.R. 870, 86th Congress, to abolish the death penalty under all
laws of the United States, except the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. At the suggestion of Judge George Boldt, the Committee
has undertaken to study all the statutes which define offenses pun­
ishable by death before making any recommendation. The Con­
ference thereupon authorized the Committee to conduct such              (
study and to report thereon at a later session of the Conference.

   TIME SPENT BY DEFENDANTS IN CONFINEMENT PRIOR TO
                           SENTENCING

  The Committee recommended approval of. S.2932, 86th Con­
gress, to permit a reduction of the term of imprisonment equal to
the time a person is held in custody for want of bail while await­
ing trial. The bill would provide as follows:
    The sentence of imprisonment of any person convicted of an
    offense in a court of the United States shall commence to run
    from the date such person is received at the penitentiary re­
    formatory, or jail for service of said sentence:· Provided, that
    the Attorney General shall give any such person credit toward
    service of his sentence for any days spent in custody for want
   .of bail set for the offense under which sentence was imposed.
  The Conference thereupon approved the proposal.
                                                                        (   ,

    PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO COUNSEL ApPOINTED TO REPRE­
                 SENT POOR PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME

       Chief Judge Smith reported that the Committee had considered
    fully the views of the National Legal Aid Society and of the New
    York Legal Aid Society with respect to the proposal to authorize
    grants to Legal Aid Societies and other organizations providing
    free legal services to indigent persons accused of crime in the Fed­
    eral courts. Both groups are in favor of S. 895 and H.R. 4185,
    86th Congress, as now written, but, if the legislation is enacted,
    they desire an opportunity later to present another bill which
    would allow grants to Legal Aid Societies on a local basis in those
    districts which do not desire to institute the public defender sys­
    tem. The Conference thereupon reaffirmed its approval of H.R.
    4185.
                     UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

       The Committee reported that it had discussed preliminarily a
    program of study of the United States Commissioner system and
    that it would endeavor to enlist the services of the Institute of
    Judicial Administration at the New York University School of
c   Law. On motion of Chief Judge Savage, the Conference author­
    ized the Committee and the Administrative Office, in their discre­
    tion, to enlist such aid.
         JUVENILE OFFENDERS IN THE DISTRICT OF CoLUMBIA

       The Conference at its September 1959 session (Con£. Rept., p.
    30) called to the attention of the Committee, the problem of the
    waiver by the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia to the
    District Court of jurisdiction over juvenile offenders. The Juve­
    nile Court in the District of Columbia has statutory authority to
    waive its jurisdiction over serious felonies committed by juveniles
    under 18 to the United States District Court for the District of
    Columbia, when, in its discretion, it deems that court to be proper.
      The Committee reported that, after considering the problem, it
    was of the view that juvenile cases are essentially local matters,
    which should be handled by the Juvenile Court of the District of
    Columbia, and that the question of the proper disposition of juve­
    nile cases requires trained and specialized personnel which at pres­
    ent are available only in the Juvenile Court. The Committee was
                                28
also of the view that such cases do not ordinarily belong in the
criminal part of the United States District Court, that the District
Court has no adequate facilities to dispose of such cases, and that
to inject the added burdens of sifting local juvenile cases on an
already overburdened district court would probably require more
United States district judges and a duplicate professional staff for
juvenile cases. The report of the Committee was approved by the
Conference.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL STATISTI03
    Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman of the newly revised
 Committee on Judicial Statistics, reported that the Committee
 had met and had reviewed the comprehensive statistical data com­
 piled by the Administrative Office and other information concern­
 ing the need for additional judgeships in the courts of appeals
and district courts. The Committee's recommendations for addi­
 tional judgeships and Conference action with respect thereto are
shown above.
    Judge Johnsen addressed the Conference informally concerning
 the work of the Committee. He stated that the Committee had
received a number of requests and suggestions that it make a
                                                                       (   )
reexamination and reappraisal of some of the statistical standards
and bases now used in reporting. the work of the courts, including
several resolutions of the Conference Committee on Multiple­
Judge Courts. These matters already have been discussed, but
because of its very recent reorganization, the Committee at present
 is not prepared to take action on them. Mr. Olney. has also
informed the Committee that a survey is being made to see what
additional statistical materials concerning court administration
are now available, which it may be possible to furnish in relation
to the operation of the court system and the work of the courts.
    The Committee plans at subsequent meetings to canvass these
and all other suggestions received and hopes through the Adminis­
trative Office to make available additional information on the
eft'eet of procedural and jurisdictional changes on the business of
the courts. The Committee has therefore recommended. to the
Administrative Office that it continue to study the improvement
of its present methods of reporting the business of the courts and
to report thereon to the Committee.
                                                                       l
                                     29

       The Committee also recommended to the Conference and to
     the Director of the Administrative Office, that steps be taken to
     provide for additional personnel in the Division of Procedural
     Studies and Statistics. This recommendation was approved by the
     Conference.

           REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PRETRIAL
                        PROCEDURE
        Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Committee on
     Pretrial Procedure, submitted to the Conference the Handbook
     of Recommended Procedures for the Trial of Protracted Cases,
     developed under the direotion of the special panel of judges ap­
     pointed by the Chief Justice to make a study of pretrial procedure
     in protracted litigation. The Handbook, as explained by Judge
     Murrah, is a well-organized compilation of suggested procedures
     and correlated forms for use by court and counsel in developing
     for trial a case involving numerous parties, multiple issues, or
     voluminous documents. It is a compendium of the many valuable
     ideas and suggestions expressed by experienced judges and trial
(	   counsel at the three seminars on protracted cases conducted by the
     study group in cooperation with the Committee on Pretrial
     Procedure.
       The recommendations of the study group with respect to the
     Handbook are as follows:
            1. That the Handbook be accepted and approved by the
         Judicial Conference as a Conference document.
            2. That the Director of the Administrative Offioe be in­
         structed to arrange for the printing of the Handbook together
         with an appropriate foreword by the Chairman of the study
         group, the printing format to be approved by a subcommittee
         of the study group to be appointed by its Chairman.
            3. That copies of the Handbook, together with the approv­
         ing resolution of the Conference be supplied to all United
         States judges and to the Chairmen of the Judiciary Commit­
         tees of the Senate and House of Representatives.
            4. That the Administrative Office arrange through the Gov­
         ernment Printing Office, or private publisher, to have the
         Handbook made available to the legal profession generally.
(
                                 30

   The Conference approved these recommendations and directed          ( ..
that upon the printing and distribution of the Handbook, the panel
of judges appointed to make the special study be discharged with
the sincere appreciation of the Conference for a job well done.
At the request of Chief Judge Murrah the Conference granted
permission to release immediately its action with respect to the
Handbook.
   Chief Judge Murrah also reported that the Committee on Pre­
trial Procedure had completed a survey among the district judges
on the use of Pretrial Procedure. On the basis of the information
compiled the Committee plans to prepare a statement of the
essential elements of a Pretrial Conference and hopes to have this
statement available for discussion at the seminar to be held in
conjunction with the Judicial Conference of the Tenth Circuit in
July.
 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION 

            OF THE JURY SYSTEM 

   Chief Judge Harry E. Watkins, Chairman of the Committee on
the Operation of the Jury System, informed the Conference that         (
the study of the operation of the jury system in the United States
District Courts, authorized by the Conference at its September
1957 session, (Conf. Rept., p. 33) had been completed. A tenta­
tive draft of a report, with recommendations as to improvements
in the jury system, has been sent to each United States district
judge with a request for additional suggestions and comments.
The draft report is also being sent to the clerks of the district
courts. The suggestions received will be considered at the next
meeting of the Committee and a final report will he presented to
the Conference at its next session.
   Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office, brought
to the attention of the Conference the varying practices which had
been disclosed in the surveys, conducted by the Administrative
Office, of the cost of the operation of the jury system in the large
multiple-judge courts. He noted in particular the divergencies
in practice in paying per diems to jurors on empanelment day.
He also called to the attention of the Conference the practice in
some states of taxing jury fees as costs to the litigants in civil
cases. These matters were referred to the Committee on the Oper­
ation of the Jury System for study and report to the Conference.        C/

       REPORT OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE
        ASSIGNMENT AND DESIGNATION OF JUDGES
       Circuit Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, Chairman of the Advisory
    Committee on the Assignment and Designation of Judges, sub­
    mitted to the Conference a revised comprehensive plan, prepared
     by the Committee, for the inter-circuit assignment of judges. He
    informed the Conference that following approval of the plan pre­
     viously submitted at the September 1959 session of the Conference
     (Conf. Rept., p. 33), the Committee became aware of a reluctance
     on the part of some chief judges to give the work of the Committee
    their full support. The Committee thereupon formulated a state­
    ment of its understanding of the scope of its work and of the gen­
    eral policy underlying its proposed operations, and undertook to
    visit the chief judge of each circuit to advise him personally of the
    position of the Committee and to encourage his cooperation.
    Thereafter, the Committee developed a statement of policy with
    respect to the assignment of judges, which was submitted with the
    plan.
       The Conference considered fully the statement of policy and the
(   proposed plan for the inter-circuit assignment of judges, as set
    forth in the Committee report. Every detail of the report was
    carefully explained by Judge Breitenstein. After amending the
    statement of policy to eliminate any reference to the obligation of
    a judge to accept an assignment outside of his circuit, the Confer­
    ence thereupon approved both the statement of policy, as amended,
    and the Committee's plan for the inter-circuit assignment of judges
    and directed that, except for assignments theretofore arranged,
    the plan become effective on July 1, 1960.
       A summary of the policy statement and plan, as approved by
    the Conference, is as follows:
             POLICIES GOVERNING THE ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES

          1. That the courts created by Congress constitute a com­
        posite unit of the Government and are designed, intended, and
        expected to administer justice throughout all of the United
        States.
          2. That the authority of the chief judge of a circuit, or the
        chief judge of a special court to request outside judicial
        help, and the authority to consent to the assignment of an
        active judge by the chief judge or judicial council of a circuit,
                            32 

or the chief judge of a special court, must be recognized at
all times. Requests for assistance should be made to, and,
except in the case of senior judges, offers of help should be
made through the respective chief judges of the circuits and
of the special courts.
   3. That in arranging for the inter-circuit assignment of a
judge, the controlling principle should be libenefit to the
judicial system as a whole" and that a certificate of necessity
ordinarily should not be issued when there are within the
circuit, or special oourt requesting the transfer, judges rea­
sonably available to supply the needs of the circuit or the
special court. Such benefit will occur in situations involving
an emergency, vacancy in a judgeship, the disability of a
judge, the accumulation of court business beyond the ability
of the appointed active judges to handle expeditiously, or the
over-all improvement of judicial administration.
   4. That consent to the inter-circuit assignment of an active
judge who is not reasonably current with his work ordi­
narily should not be given. In situations where a judge is
reasonably current with his own work, but the court to which
he is appointed is not current, the assignment may beap­          (
proved when the experience which such judge may be
expected to gain, and the services to be rendered, will con­
tribute to the over-all improvement of judicial administra­
tion. Consent to the inter-circuit assignment of a newly
appointed judge may be given when there is a reasonable
expectation that the experience to be gained will be useful
in the performance of his judicial duties in the court of ap­
pointment. In emergency situations, consent should be given
freely.
   5. That senior judges be encouraged to have their names
placed on the Roster of Senior Judges and to carry on such
judioial work as their personal situations warrant.
       PROCEDURE FOR THE ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES

  1. That there be appointed by the Chief JUBtice an Assign­
ment Committee composed of five judges with headquarters
at the official station of the ohairman of the Committee, who
would be authorized to employ such secretarial and clerical
help as may be reasonably required.                               l~
                              33 

     2. That the Committee assist in the assignment and des­
  ignation of federal judges for service outside of their circuits,
  or the special courts to which they have becn appointed, by
  making recommendations to the Chief Justice, but without
  authority to approve or to disapprove such assignments.
     3. That all requests by the chief judge of a circuit or the
  chief judge of a special court for the assignment of a judge
, to his circuit or court, be presented to the Committee. The
  request should state why, when, where and for how long such
  service is required and the type of judicial work to be
  performed.
     4. That an offer of an active judge to serve outside of the
  circuit or special court to which he is appointed, be first sub­
  mitted to the chief judge or the Judicial Council of the Cir­
  cuit, or in the case of a judge of a special court to the chief
  judge of that court, and, if approved, that it then be trans­
  mitted to the Committee. The offer of a senior judge to serve
  outside of his circuit should be transmitted directly to the
  Committee.
     5. That upon the receipt of a request for the services of
  a judge, the Committee shall communicate with the chief
  judge of the circuit, or the chief judge of the special court
  from which an offer of service has becn received, or directly
  with a senior judge who has offered his services, to ascertain
  the availability of a judge to accept the assignment.
     6. That if a request for an assignment is received and no
  offer of service has been made by a judge available for such
  assignment, the Committee shall ascertain from the chief
  judges of the circuits, the chief judges of the special courts,
  or directly from the senior judges, the availability of a judge
  to accept such assignment.
     7. That having ascertained the availability of a judge to
  accept an assignment, the Committee shall secure the re­
  quired certificate of necessity and the grant of consent, or,
  in the case of a senior judge, his statement as to availability,
  and transmit them to the Chief Justice with the recommenda­
  tion of the Committee.
     8. That in the event the requests for service exceed the
, number of judges available for such, service, the Committee
  shall recommend to the Chief Justice which requests shall be
                                 34
    preferred and in making such recorrunendation, shall give
    priority to situations of emergency, vacancy, and disability.
       9. That the Committee prepare a statement from ti.n:re to
    time showing the courts of appeals, district courts and special
    courts which need, or may need, the services of judges from
    other circuits and courts, the courts from which judges are, or
    might reasonably be expected to be available for such service,
    and the senior judges who are available for service away from
    their circuits or courts. Copies of the statement shall be sent
    by the Committee to the Chief Justice and to the chief judges
    of each ciTcuit and of each speeial court.
       10. That the Committee prepare for each meeting of the
    Judicial Conference of the United States, a report showing the
    requests received for the services of judges, the offers received
    of availability for assignments to other courts, the recom­
    mendations which the Corrunittee has made with respect to
    assignments, and any other pertinent information.
   JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEES ON COURT
    ADMINISTRATION AND REVISION OF THE LAWS
   Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on           (
the Revision of the Laws, submitted a report on legislative pro­
posals considered jointly by the Committees on Court Administra­
tion and Revision of the Laws:
   (1) Abolition of Terms of Cow-t.-The Conference at its March
1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 13) referred to the Committee on
Court Administration the proposal of Judge Carl A. Hatch to
repeal the statutes requiring the holding of formal terms of court
and to provide that courts shall be in continuous session. The
Committees were of the view that the requirement for holding
formal, periodic terms by the district courts no longer serves any
useful purpose and that the statutory requirements for such terms
should be eliminated.
   The Conference thereupon approved the following draft of a
bill presented by the Corrunittees:
                             A BILL
      To provide that the district courts shall be always open for
    certain purposes, to abolish terms of court and to regulate the
    sessions of the courts for transacting judicial business.           (
        Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa­
     tives of the United State of America in Congress assem­
     bled That sections 138, 139, 140, and 141 of title 28,
     United States Code, be amended to read as follows:
     138. Terms abolished; court always open
        The district court shall not hold formal terms but shall
      be deemed always open for the purpose of filing any
      pleading or other proper paper, of issuing and returning
     mesne and final process, and of making and directing all
     interlocutory motions, orders, and rules.
      139. 	Times for holding regular sessions
        The times for commencing regular sessions of the dis­
     trict court for transacting judicial business at the places
     fixed by this chapter shall be determined by the rules or
     orders of the court. Such rules or orders may provide
     that at one or more of such places the court shall be in
     continuous session for such purposes on all business days
     throughout the year. At other places sessions of the
     court shall continue for such purposes until terminated
(	   by order of final adjournment or by commencement of
     the next regular session at the same place.
     140. Adjournment
        (a) Any district court may by order made anywhere
     within its district, adjourn or, with the consent of the
     judicial council of the circuit, pretermit any regular ses­
     sion of court for insufficient business or other good cause.
        (b) If the judge of a district court is unable to attend
     and unable to make an order of adjournment, the clerk
     may adjourn the court to the next regular session or to
     any earlier day which he may determine.
     141. 	Special sessions; places; notice
        Special sessions of the district court may be held at
     such places in the district as the nature of the business
     may require, and upon such notice as the court orders.
        Any business may be transacted at a special session
     which might be transacted at a regular session.
                                36
            SEC. 2 Section 1869 of title 28, United States Code, is
         amended by striking out the word "term" and inserting        (
         in lieu thereof the word "session".
   (2) Judicial Survivors Annuity Act.-Judge Maris informed
the Conference that as a result of a revision of the Civil Service
Retirement Act, occurring a few days prior to the enactment of
 the Judicial Survivors' Annuity System, the provisions of 28
U.S.C. 376 are not in accord with the survivors' annunity provi­
sions with respect to Members of Congress, as originally intended,
and in addition that the Section contains two references to the
Civil Service Retirement Act, which are no longer appropriate or
correct. The Civil Service Retirement Act amendments of 1956
with respect to survivorship benefits for Members of Congress
eliminated the requirement that a widow without dependent
children be 50 years of age before receiving a widow's annunity,
increased the annuity payable to dependent children, liberalized
the formula for computing the widow's annuity in respect to cer­
tain civilian service, and increased the maximum widow's annuity,
which the widow of a Member of Congress might receive, to 40
percent of the member's five-year average salary.
   The Committees recommended that Congress be requested to           (
amend 28 U.S.C. 376 to bring it into conformity with the survivor-
ship annuity provisions of the present Civil Service Retirement
Act, as they apply to Members of Congress. The Conference
thereupon approved this recommendation and the following draft
of a bill recommended by the Committee:
                            A BILL
    To amend section 376 of title 28, United States Code.
           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa­
        tives of the United States of America in Congress as­
        sembled, That subsection (c) of section 376 of title 28,
        United States Code, is amended by striking out in the
        first sentence thereof the words:
           Itwithin the purview of section 707 of title 5"
        and inserting in lieu thereof the words:
           "which would be creditable under section 3 of the
        Civil Service Retirement Act as amended".
                           37
        SEC. 2. Subsection (d) of such section 376 is amended
     by striking out in the first sentence thereof the words:
        "or Federal farm loan bonds".
        SEC. 3. Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection
     (g) of such section 376 are amended to read as follows:
       "(1) if such judge is survived by a widow there shall
     be paid to such widow an immediate annuity in an
    amount computed as provided in subsection (n) of this
    section; and
        (2) if such judge is survived by a widow or ",idower
     and a dependent child or children there shall also be paid
     to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity
    equal to $1,800 divided by the number of such children
     or $600, whichever is lesser; or
        (3) if such judge leaves no surviving widow or
    widower but leaves a surviving dependent child or
    children, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each such
                                                                  i
    child an immediate annuity of $720."
       SEC. 4. Subsection (n) of such section 376 is amended
    by striking out the words:
(      "an employee described in section 698(g) of title 5,
    and (2) % of 1 per centum of such average annual salary
    multiplied by his years of any other prior allowable serv­
    ice, but such annuity shall not exceed 37%"
    and inserting in lieu thereof the words:
       Ita Congressional employee defined in section 1 (c) of
    the Civil Service Retirement Act as amended, (2) % of
    1 per centum of such average annual salary multiplied
    by his years, not exceeding five, of any other prior allow­
    able service, (3) % of 1 per centum of such average an­
    nual salary multiplied by his years, in excess of five but
    not exceeding ten, of such other prior allowable service,
    and (4) 1 per centum of such average annual salary mul­
    tiplied by his years of service, in excess of ten, of such
    other prior allowable service, but such annuity shall not
    exceed 40".
       SEC. 5. Subsection (0) of such section 376 is amended
    by. striking out at the end thereof the words:
       "within the purview of section 707 of title 5" and
    inserting in lieu thereof the words:
                                   38

            "which would be creditable under section 3 of the Civil ( '
          Service Retirement Act as amended".
     (3) Revision of the Canal Zone Code.-The Committees re­
  ported that the views of the Conference had been requested with
 respect to the following three provisions contained in a proposed
  revision of the Canal Zone Code: (a) that the term of the district
  judge be increased from eight to ten years; (b) that the removal
 of the district judge by the President before the expiration of his
  term be made only "for cause"; and (c) that in the discretion
 of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
 Courts that the district judge shall receive, in addition to the
 basic compensation prescribed for judges of the United States
 District Courts, Han overseas (tropical) differential not in excess
 of an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount of the basic
 compensation" .
    The lengthening of the term of the district judge for the Canal
 Zone from eight to ten years would make him eligible to retire
 under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 373, after completing one term
 of appointment. It was the view of the Committee that this was
 desirable, but that such a provision should also be made applicable
 to the territorial judges in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin            (
 Islartds. Accordingly, the Committees have hereinafter recom­
 mended an amendment to 28 U.S.C. 373 to reduce from ten to eight
years the length of time which a territorial judge must serve in
order to secure minimum retirement benefits. On recommenda­
tion of the Committee, the Conference disapproved the lengthen­
ing of the term of the judge in the Canal Zone alone from eight
 to ten years.
    The Committees reported that the Organic Acts of the terri­
tories of Guam and the Virgin Islands restrict the power of the
President over district judges to removal "for cause", and accord­
ingly recommended that this same provision be incorporated in
the Canal Zone Code. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
    With respect to a cost-of-living differential for the district judge
in the Canal Zone, the Committees noted that while such differen­
tials have been paid for many years to federal employees in the
other overseas territories, such as Alaska, Hawaii,Puerto Rico,
the Virgin Islands and Guam, they have never been allowed to the
judges of the district courts of these territories. The salary of
                                 39 

 $22,500 per annum paid to the district judges in the territories
 is presently in excess of the salaries paid to all other federal em­
 ployees in the territories, including the Governors, and in the
 opinion of the Committees, it is adequate without the allowance
 of the cost-of-living differential. Upon recommendation of the
 Committee the Conference disapproved the proposal.
    (4) H.R. 9005, to amend 28 U.s.C. 373 to Provide Retirement
 Pensions After Age 65 to Territorial Judges Who Have Served at
 Least Eight Years Instead of Restricting These Benefits to Those
 Who Have Served for at Least Ten Years.-It was the view of
 the Committees that retirement benefits should be provided after
 age 65 to a judge who has been compelled, through no fault of his
 own, to leave office after serving a term of eight years. However,
 H.R. 9005 also provides that a pension, after age 65, be paid to
 a judge who voluntarily resigns before reaching retirement age and
 that service in the Armed Forces in time of war, not exceeding
 five years, be included in the computation of aggregate years of
 judicial service for the purpose of determining whether a terri­
 torial judge is entitled to a pension and in determining its amount.
 The Committees were of the view that these two proposals should
be disapproved and suggested that the Conference recommend to
Congress that H.R. 9005 be amended so as merely to reduce from
ten to eight years the amount of judicial service required of a
territorial judge in order to entitle him to receive a retirement
pension under 28 U.S.C. 273, based upon his salary and service.
This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
    (5) S.2326 To Give Congressional Consent to an Interpleader
Compact Between or Among Any Two or More of the States,
Territories, and Possessions of the United States and the District
of Columbia.-This interpleader compact would enable service to
  be had in any of the states adhering to the compact in actions in
the nature of interpleader brought in any other of such states,
thus enabling the interpleader court to acquire personal jurisdic­
tion over claimants located anywhere within the compacting states.
The Federal Interpleader Act now permits such actions to be
brought in a federal district court with the right to make service
throughout the United States in cases involving diversity of citi":
zen ship and at least $500.00 in amount. The compact will make
it possible for many interpleader cases to be brought in the state
courts, thus relieving to some extent the burden of work in the
                                  40

federal district courts. The Committees recommended that S.
 2326 be approved in principle, insofar as it affects the federal          (

courts, recognizing that the policy involved is largely one for
determination by Congress. This recommendation of the Com~
mittee was approved by the Conference.
   (6) H.R. 8752 To Limit Venue in Cases Brought Under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act.-This bill would amend the
Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. 56, to provide that suits
thereunder may be brought against an interstate carrier by rail­
road only in a federal district court within, or a competent state
court of, (1) the state in which the cause of action arose, or (2)
the state of which the person suffering injury or death was a resi­
dent at the time the cause of action arose. The bill would also
add the proviso that if
      at any time the period during which suit on any such cause
      of action shall not be barred by limitation, the common car­
      rier, against which such cause of action is asserted, shall either
      not be doing business within the State in which the cause of
      action arose, or shall not be doing business within the State
      of which the person suffering injury or death was a resident
      at the time the cause of action arose, in that event such suit       (, 

      may at such time be brought in any district court of the
      United States within, or in a State court of competent juris­
      diction of, any State in which such carrier then is doing
      business.
   The Committee reported that under the present provisions of
law a great many suits under the Federal Employers' Liability
Act have been brought in certain congested metropolitan distnct
courts where counsel for the claimants reside, but which are far
distant from the scene of the accident, or the place of residence
of the claimant. As a result witnesses have frequently· been
transported for long distances at great expense and hardship to a
party. This abuse has been corrected in part through the exercise
by the district courts of their discretionary power, under 28 U.S.C.
1404(a), to transfer such suits to a more convenient district.
However, this involves additional procedure and delay and is not
available, in any event, in the State courts. The Committees were
of the view that the proposal to restrict venue, as proposed the in
bill, is salutary. The Conference thereupon approved the bill.
                                                                           L
                                         41 


           (7) H.R.9591 and H.R. 9632 to Provide for a Court of Veterans'
(      Appeals to Review Decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals
       in the Veterans' Administration.-These bills are similar to other
        bills introduced in the 86th Congress, which were considered by the
        Conference at its September 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 7). As
       it had done on previous occasions, the Conference at that session
       took no position with respect to the policy involved in providing
       judicial review of veterans' claims, but recommended that if such
       review is to be granted, that it should be in the district court sitting
       in the veteran's locality .and not in a United States Court of Ap­
       peals, or a special court of appeals, and further that the review,
       if granted, should be in accordance with the standards of the Ad­
       ministrative Procedure Act. Upon the recommendation of the
       Committees the Conference adhered to this position and accord­
       ingly disapproved H.R. 9591 and H.R. 9632.
           (8) S. 2970 to require that judgments for the Condemnation
       of Land by the United States be Registered, Recorded, Docketed,
       Indexed, and Cross-indexed in Conformity with the Law of the
       State in which such Property is Situated.-At present judgments
       for the condemnation of land entered in a district court are re­
(I 	   corded only in the office of the clerk of the court for the district
       and division in which the judgment was entered. The Commit­
       tees pointed out that 28 U.S.a. 1962 provides under certain circum­
       stances for the registration and recording of a judgment of a dis­
       trictcourt in the appropriate local or county office before a lien
       will attach to property, and that recently similar provisions with
       respect to the filing of a notice of the commencement of a suit in
       the district court concerning real property have been made by 28
       UB.C. 1964, in order that the effect of lis pendens may be achieved.
       The Committees were of the view that a similar procedure with
       respect to the reoordingof judgments in condemnation proceedings
       would be appropriate and recommended that S. 2970 be approved
       in principle. The recommendation was approved by the Con­
       ference.
          (9) H.R. 10,089 to Permit a Civil Action to be Brought Against
       an   Officer of the United States in His Official Capacity, a Person
       Acting Under Him or an Agency of the United States, in Any Judi­
       cial District of the United States Where a Plaintiff in the Action
       resides.-This bill is similar to H.R. 10,892, 85th Congress, which
       was referred to the Committee on the Revision of the Laws at
                                  42 


 the March 1958 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 27).
 Present law requires that civil actions against officers or agencies
 of the United States be brought in the district of the residence
 of the defendant officer or agency, which, in many cases, means
 that the action must be brought in the District of Columbia. The
 Committees were of the view that the venue statute should be
 broadened so as to authorize the institution of such suit.s not only
 in the district of the residence of the defendant, and in the district
 of the residence of the plaintiff as provided by H.R. 10,089, but
 also in the district in which the cause of action arose, or in which
 the property involved is located. The Committees accordingly
 recommended that H.R. 10,089 be approved in principle, but that
it be amended so as to broaden the venue to include the district
 in which the cause of action arose, or in which the property in­
volved in the action is situated. This recommendation was ap­
 proved by the Conference.
    (10) Fl.R. 3217 to Provide that for Purposes of Diversity of
Citizenship Jurisdiction a Corporation Shall Be Deemed a Citizen
of any State Where It Is Qualified To Do Busines8.-The Confer­
ence at its September 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 11) authorized
the Committees to establish a subcommittee to collaborate with            (
the American Law Institute in its comprehensive study of the
diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and further were directed to
consider the proposal of Judge Bailey Aldrich to prohibit a plain­
tiff from prosecuting an action under the diversity statute in a
district court sitting in the State of which he is a citizen .. Judge
Maris reported that a subcommittee, consisting of Chief Judge
Biggs, Senior Judge Phillip.g, Circuit Judge Prettyman and Dis­
trict Judges Goodman, Connally, Wright and Christenson had been
constituted to consider ways and means of cooperating with the
American Law Institute in its study. The subcommittee had also
prepared a report concerning the historical and legal background
of the diversity jurisdiction and is sending a questionnaire to
State Bar Associations, law schools and associations of state judges.
Accordingly the Committees requested and were granted leave to
defer their report on H.R. 3217 and the proposal of Judge Aldrich
until a later session of the Conference.

                                       43

      At the request of Judge Maris the Conference authorized the
    immediate release of its recommendations with respect to any
    legislative proposal.

      REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF MULTIPLE-JUDGE
                       COURTS
       Chief Judge David A. Pine, Chairman of the Committee ap­
    pointed to meet and consider the personnel and budgetary require­
    ments of the large district courts, reported that the Committee
    had been organized and had agreed upon the scope of its activities
    as follows:
       (1) To provide for a greater exchange of experience and ideas
    among the several metropolitan district courts,
       (2) To make available to the Administrative Office and to Con­
    gress, if needed, detailed organizational charts of the multiple­
    judge courts, showing the duties and functions of the clerk's office
    and other agencies and supporting personnel of the courts, as an
    aid in the presentation of the budget and other matters to the
    Congress, and
       (3) To consider methods for supplying more detailed statistical
    information about the workloads in the various mUltiple-judge
    courts, which handle approximately one-half of the judicial busi­
    ness of the federal system.
       As a result of its deliberations, the Committee has formulated
    various resolutions which have been transmitted to the Chairmen
    of the appropriate Committees of the Judicial Conference for
    their consideration.
     RETIREMENT PROVISIONS FOR DIRECTORS OF THE
             ADMINISTRAT.I,VE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES
             COURTS
          The Conference was advised by Chief Judge Biggs that, while
     the general retirement provisions for employees of the Adminis­
     trative Office are adequate, those in respect to the Director are
    'nSe·ot ~dequt~te; Th'e re~~n for this il~bnotl tbhat thhe us~ahl CiVIh'l   ..

     ranks of career Government employees and that the retirement
     system is geared to this latter group. The need for such a retire­
(
                                44 

ment program, together with a proposed plan, was discussed and
the Conference thereupon adopted the following resolution:            r
       Resolved, That the Judicial Conference of the United
    States urge the enactment of legislation to establish a re­
    tirement program for Directors of the Administrative Office,
    including the former Director, designed to conform to the par­
    ticular nature of the office, which is affected in character,
    tenure, and independence by its unique position in the Ju­
    dicial Branch of the Government. Further, that such a pro­
    gram should include retirement and disability benefits, and
    participation in the Judicial Survivors Annuity System, upon
    the same basis as United States judges, except that retirement
    at 70 years of age should be mandatory in the case of a
    Director.
         OPINIONS OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS
  On motion of Chief Judge Marvin Jones, the Conference
adopted the following resolution:
      Resolved, That the Judicial Conference of the United
    States approve a request by the United States Court of ( '
    Claims that its opinions be published hereafter in the Fed- :
    eral Reporter, 2d series.
              INSTITUTES ON SENTENCING
   Honorable Lawrence E. Walsh, Deputy Attorney General of the
United States, had informed the Conference that it would be
difficult for the Department of Justice, with its limited staff, to
provide speakers and other services for all the Institutes on Sen­
tencing being scheduled on a circuit level this year. He further
suggested that Institutes on Sentencing conducted on a regional.
or national basis are likely to be more productive and to attract
recognized experts in the fields of criminology and penology, who
would be unable to attend every circuit institute.
   The Conference thereafter received requests from the Chief
Judges of the Second, Third, Fourth and Ninth Circuits for au­
thority to convene Institutes on Sentencing in their circuits this
year pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 334. Plans for some of these institutes
are not yet complete. The institutes in the Third, Fourth and
Ninth Circuits are being planned in conjunction with the annual       L~
                                       45 

       Judicial Conferences of the Circuits, but the institute in the Second
       Circuit is to be scheduled as a one-day program apart from the
       Circuit Conference.
         It was brought to the attention of the Conference that 28 U.S.C.
       334 requires that the chief judge of each circuit request, through
       the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
       Courts, authority of the Judicial Conference to convene institutes
       and joint councils on sentencing. The statute further requires the
      approval of the Judicial Conference of the "time, place, partici­
       pants, agenda, and other arrangements for such institutes and
       joint councils".
         The Conference discussed fully the views of the Department of
      Justice and the statutory requirements for convening Institutes
      on Sentencing. It was pointed out during these discussions that
      a program on sentencing could be held as part of. an annual Cir­
      cuit Conference without invoking the provisions of 28 U.S.c. 334.
      The Chief Judges of the Third, Fourth and Ninth Circuits there­
      upon withdrew their requests for authority to convene formaI
      sentencing institutes stating that they would develop a sentencing
      program for their circuit conferences. . The Conference thereupon
(.    approved the plan for. an Institute on Sentencing in the Second
      Circuit and authorized the Directorof the Administrative Office
      to arrange with the~ other circuits, and with the Attorney Gen­
      eral, a program for their respective judicial conferences that would
      be similar to the program of a sentencing institute.·
         It was the sense of the Conference that, in the future,· sen­
                                                         or
      tencing institutes should be held on a regional national basis
      so that both the· Administrative Office and the Department of
      Justice could be of maximum assistance in program planning, as
      contemplated by the statute.· ..
      COMPENSATION OF CQMMiSSIONERS APPOINTED
       PURSUANT TO RULE 71 A(h) FEDERAL RULES OF
       CIVIL PROCEDURE       ....           .

         Mr. Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office,
       brought to the attention of the Coriference the proposal of the
     . Department of Justice that the compensation of commissioners
       appointed in land condemnation cases under Rule 71 A(h) Fed­
       eral Rules of Civil Procedure, be charged against the appropria­
                                 46 

tions made to the Judiciary instead of the appropriations of the         (~'
Department of Justice.
   The Conference expressed disapproval of the proposal and au­
thorized the Chief Justice to appoint a special committee of the
Conference to conduct, in cooperation with the Department of
Justice, a study of the over-all problems with respect to the utiliza­
tion and compensation of land commissioners.
PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS OF AP­
   PEALS OF THE EIGHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS
  At the request of Chief Judge Johnsen the Conference, pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that terms of the Court of Appeals of
the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be pretermitted
during the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1960.
  At the request of Chief Judge Murrah the Conference consented
that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit at places
other than Denver be pretermitted during the fiscal year com­
mencing July 1, 1960.

                                             EARL WARREN,
                                                  Chief Justice.
  Washington, D.C., May 19, 1980.
                                                                    (

                           APPENDIX

     COMMITTEES ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                 PROCEDURE 

   The Chief Justice of the United States, subsequent to the Con­
ference session, publicly announced the appointment of six na­
tionally-organized committees of judges, lawyers, and legal schol­
ars whose job it will be to study and to recommend to the Supreme
Court improvement in the rules of practice and procedure in the
Federal courts.
  The Committees were appointed pursuant to an Act passed by
Congress [P.L. 85-513, 72 Stat. 3561 July H, 1958, authorizing the
Judicial Conference of the United States, of which the Chief
Justice is Chairman, to make a continuous study of the Federal
rules.
   "The rules of court," Chief Justice Earl Warren said, "are the (
most important tools of the courtroom lawyer. So long as we
have the inevitable changes in our social, economic and political
lives, the demand for amendments in the rules, and also for new
rules, by which we resolve conflicts in the courts is equally
inevitable.
   "It is essential that our rules of court be up-to-date and all
amendments should be studied and recommended by committees
with as broad an outlook and base as possible. Accordingly these
committees include representatives of the bar, the judiciary and
the legal scholars and for their ideas they will draw upon the
bench and bar of the country as a whole and particularly the
Judicial Conferences in all eleven of the Federal circuits.
   "Experience has shown that in order to promote simplicity in
procedure, the just determination of litigation and the elimination
of unjustifiable expense and delay, it is essential that the operation
and effect of the Federal rules of practice and procedure should
be the subject of continuous study. Such study is the objective
of the committees being announced today, and every judge, prac­
ticing lawyer, and legal scholar will be afforded the opportunity
                               ~)                                    L
                                     49 

to participate----to state his views-with assurances that those
views will be given consideration."
  The Committees, and the Committee Chairmen, are:
    Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure 

      Albert B. Maris, Chairman 

    Advisory Committee on Civil Rules 

      Dean Acheson, Chairman 

    Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules 

      John C. Pickett, Chainnan 

    Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules 

      Walter L. Pope, Chainnan 

    Advisory Committee on General Orders in Bankruptcy 

      Phillip Fonnan, Cha.innan 

    Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules 

      E. Barrett Prettyman, Chairman
   The Advisory Committees will conduct the basic studies and
 develop reports and recommendations in the respective fields.
 These will be forwarded. to the standing Committee on cRules of
 Practice and Procedure which, in turn, will report to the Judicial
 Conference of the United States. If approved, the Judicial Con­
ference will formally forward the report and recommendations to
 the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court
 will approve, modify, or disapprove of the changes in the Federal
 rules, and those adopted will be transmitted by the Supreme Court
 to the Congress. In such cases, the rules automatically become
law in ninety days unless the Congress acts adversely.
   Membership on the Committees are for 2 and 4 year terms,
with each member entitled to one additional term. This will have
 the effect of bringing new ideas to the Committees and keeping
 pace with developments in the law.
   Headquarters Secretariat for the rules study will be in the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Supreme Court
 Building, Washington, D.C., under the direction of Warren Olney
III, Director. Aubrey Gasque, Assistant Director of the Admin­
istrative Office, will serve as Executive Secretary for the Rules
,Committees.
