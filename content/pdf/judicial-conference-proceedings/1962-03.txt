ment of Justice. A draft bill to provide for a jury commission in
each United States district court, prepared by the Department of

                                                                           (J
                                       3

     Justice, was brought to the attention of the Conference and was
     referred to the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System
     for consideration and report.

              JUDICIAL COUNCILS OF THE CIRCUITS

       At the request of Congressman Emanuel Celler, Chairman of the
     Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, and
     of Senator Olin D. Johnston, Chairman of the Subcommittee on
     Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Committee on the
     Judiciary of the United States Senate, the Conference reviewed the
     action taken at the September 1961 session of the Conference
     (Rept., p. 67), approving H.R. 6690, to provide for the repre­
     sentation of district judges on the judicial councils of the circuits.
     After full consideration, the Conference voted to reaffirm its ap­
     proval of this bill.

                  SURVEY OF JUDICIAL BUSINESS

       The, Conference received reports from the Chief Judge of the
     Court of Claims, the Chief Judge of the Court of Customs and .
(	   Patent Appeals, and from the Chief Judges of the respective cir­
     cuits, concerning the state of the dockets in each circuit. These
     reports were supplemented by the district judges who presented
     additional details concerning the business of the district courts in
     their circuits. The Conference was informed that considerable
     progress has been made in some districts in the disposition of the
     civil actions pending more than 3 years, in accordance with the plan
     and policy adopted by the Conference at its last session. Efforts
     to dispose of these cases, however, have been hampered this year
     by continuing vacancies in judgeship positions in several heavily
     congested districts.

                       COURT ADMINISTRATION
       The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration, Chief
     Judge John Biggs, Jr., reported on the following matters within
     the jurisdiction of the Committee.

                                 4

ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS, DIVISIONS, AND PLACES OF HOLDING COURT
    The Conference considered the following bills to create new dis­

 tricts or divisions, and to provide for additional places of holding 

 court: 

    (1) H.R. 9051, 87th Congress, to provide a new district in the 

 State of California, and to provide an additional district judge for 

 that district, whose official station would be San Jose. The pro­

 posal has been disapproved by the Judicial Council of the Ninth 

 Circuit. On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference 

disapproved the bill. 

    (2) H.R. 8337, 87th Congress, to establish Clinton, Goldsboro,
and Jacksonville as additional places of holding court in the East­
ern District of North Carolina. The Judicial Council of the Fourth
Circuit favors the holding of court at Clinton which is the residence
of the Chief Judge of the district. The Conference thereupon
recommended that the bill be amended to provide that Clinton
only be designated as an additional place for holding court and
that Goldsboro and Jacksonville be not designated as additional
places for holding court in the Eastern District of North Carolina.
    (3) H.R. 10148, 87th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 130(a), to
include Menominee County within the jurisdiction of the United (
States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.
Menominee County had previously been the Menominee Indian
Reservation. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference approved the bill.

        ACCOMMODATIONS AT PLACES OF HOLDING COURT
   The Conference considered the following bills which would
provide for the waiving of the limitations and restrictions of 28
U.S.C. 142 in regard to accommodations at places of holding court:
   (1) S. 2730 and H.R. 9902, 87th Congress, to waive the restric­
tions of 28 U.S.C. 142 with respect to the holding of court at
Fayetteville in the Western District of Arkansas. The Judicial
Council of the Eighth Circuit has disapproved S. 2730 on the
ground that the number of cases filed at Fayetteville does not
warrant the expense, and would not in the future warrant the
expense of constructing federal court facilities. Upon reconimen­
dation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved these bills.
   (2) H.R. 9844, H.R. 9898, and H.R. 10008, 87th Congress, to
                                                                     (
                                      5

    waive the limitations and restrictions of 28 U.S.C. 142 with respect
    to the holding of regular terms of court at Bridgeport, and special
    terms of court at Stamford, Connecticut, pending the construction
    of permanent court quarters and accommodations at Bridgeport.
    It is the view of the Judicial Council of the Second Circuit that a
    permanent seat of court should be established at Bridgeport with
    appropriate facilities and that until such facilities are available at
    Bridgeport, or become available at New Haven, suitable courtroom
    facilities should be leased at Stamford. Upon recommendation
    of the Committee, the Conference requested the immediate enact­
    ment of one of these bills.
       (3) H.R. 10016, 87th Congress, to waive the restrictions of 28
    U.S.C. 142 in regard to holding court at Decatur, Alabama. The
    Committee reported that this proposal had been favorably acted
    upon by the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit and the Confer­
    ence approved the bill.

                       SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES

       The Committee had considered further the proposals contained
    in S. 1268, 87th Congress, relating to (1) the selection of chief
(   judges of the circuits and of multiple-judge district courts, (2) the
    terms of service of chief judges, and (3) the powers and responsi­
    bilities of chief judges with respect to the general administrative
    superintendence of the business of the circuit and district courts,
    and recommended that the bill not be approved at this time. The
    Conference discussed the bill at some length and directed the Com­
    mittee to undertake a further study of the proposals contained
    therein in the light of the discussions in the Conference.

                   DISBURSEMENT OF JUDICIARY FuNDS

      H.R. 8304, 87th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 711 and 751 to
    provide that the clerks of the courts of appeals and district courts,
    respectively, subject to regulations prescribed by the Director of
    the Administrative Office, should disburse appropriated funds for
    the maintenance and operation of the courts. The Committee re.­
    ported that the bill had been discussed with the Department of
    Justice and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts,
    and that there was a large variance in their respective estimates of
    the additional cost to the Judiciary to assume this function. The
                                  6

Committee suggested that the Conference recommend to the Con­
gress that action on H.R. 8304, or any similar bill, be withheld until
further study has been made by the Administrative Office. This
recommendation was approved by the Conference.

                           CLERKS' FEES

   It was brought to the attention of the Conference that the clerks
of the courts of appeals have expressed some concern as to the
proper fee to be charged upon the transfer of a deportation proceed­
ing to a court of appeals from a district court under the provisions
of the Act of September 6, 1961, 75 Stat. 650. The Conference,
after full consideration, directed that no fee be charged by a clerk
of a court of appeals upon the transfer of such a proceeding.
   The Conference was informed that it has been more than 15 years
since any increases have been made in the filing fees in the district
courts and in courts of appeals, and that most of the miscellaneous
fees have remained unchanged for about the same length of time.
The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, directed
that the Administrative Office undertake a study of the existing
fee schedules and report any suggested changes in fees to the Com­
mittee for its consideration and further report to the Conference.       (

              RETIREMENT OF JUSTICES AND JUDGES

  S. 2285 and H.R. 5282, 87th Congress, would amend 28
U.S.C. 371 (b) to provide a retirement plan for justices and judges
similar to that established for territorial judges by 28 U.S.C. 373.
The bills provide that a justice or judge may retire at age 65 with
a minimum of 10 years' service, if he would agree to accept in lieu
of the full salary of his office during the remainder of his lifetime,
that portion of the salary of his office which is equal to the ratio
existing between the aggregate number of his years of judicial
service and 15 years. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference disapproved the bills at the present time.

               RETIREMENT OF TERRITORIAL JUDGES

  H.R. 1782, 87th Congress, would provide that the amendment to
28 U.S.C. 373 made by Section 5 of the Act of February 10, 1954,
69 Stat. 13, should apply to any judge of the United States District
                                  7

Court for the District of Hawaii who retired under Sec. 373 before
February 10, 1954, as if such amendment had been in effect on the
date of retirement of the judge. Upon the recommendation of
the Committee, the Conference disapproved the bill.

                JUDICIAL SURVIVORS' ANNUITY ACT

  The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, dis­
approved the proposal contained in S. 440, 87th Congress, to reduce
from two years to one year the time that a wife must have been
married to a judge before his death in order to be eligible for a
widow's annuity under 28 U.S.C. 376.

            DISQUALIFICATION FOR BIAS OR PREJUDICE

  In accordance with the direction of the Conference at its Septem­
ber 1961 session (Conf. Rept., p. 68), the Committees on Revision
of the Laws and Court Administration undertook a joint study of
28 U.S.C. 144 relating to the disqualification of judges. The fol­
lowing draft of a bill to amend 28 U.S.C. 144, prepared by the
Committees, was submitted and approved by the Conference:

                               A BILL

To amend Section 144 of Title 28 of the United States Code.
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That section 144
of title 28 of the United States Code is amended so as to read:
  "Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes
and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom
the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against
him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no
further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such
proceeding.
   "The affidavit shall state the facts and reasons for the belief that
bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than 30 days
before the trial or hearing of the proceeding, or good cause shall be
shown for failure to file it within such time. An order shall then
be entered directing that an authenticated copy of the affidavit shall
be forthwith certified to the chief judge of the circuit in which such
proceeding is pending, and said chief judge, or any judge designated
                                  8

by him, shall determine whether the affidavit is timely and suffi­
cient. A party may file only one such affidavit in any case. It shall
be accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record stating that it
is made in good faith."

                        IN BANe HEARINGS

   A number of instances have developed recently where courts of
appeals sitting in banc have divided equally. The Committee
requested and was granted leave to explore the possibility of find­
ing some means of obviating such equal divisions and to report at
a later session of the Conference.

                 ELECTRONIC SOUND RECORDINGS

   The Conference at itsSeptemoor 1961 session (Con£. Rept., p. 71)
directed the Committee to draft and seek a clarifying amendment
to 28 U.S.C. 753(b) to authorize court reporters to file electronic
sound recordings of proceedings on arraignment, plea and sentence
in criminal cases, eliminating the necessity for transcription. The
Committee reported that it has considered several drafts of such
an amendment, but has made no final determination. The Con­
ference accordingly granted leave to the Committee to consider the
matter further and to report at a later session of the Conference.

                    COURTROOM PHOTOGRAPHS

   The Committee reported that it had taken notice of increasing
activity by the press, radio and television broadcasting media, and
others, calling for a relaxation of the present prohibition of taking
photographs in the courtroom during the progress of judicial pro­
ceedings and the broadcasting of judicial proceedings by radio and
television. The Committee believes this subject to be of such
immediate importance that it warrants an expression of policy by
the Judicial Conference at this time.
   It is the view of the Committee that in the interest of efficient
judicial administration and to aid in the preservation of the right
to a fair and impartial trial, the Conference should reaffirm its
adherence to the principle declared in Rule 53, Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, and broaden it to include television broad­
casting and the taking of photographs within the environs of the
                                           9

    courtroom, making it applicable to all proceedings in the federal
    courts. The Conference considered the matter and voted to ap­
    prove the following resolution:
           Resolved, That the Judicial Conference of the United States condemns the
        taking of photographs in the courtroom or its environs in connection with
        any judicial proceedings, and the broadcasting of judicial proceedings by
        radio, television, or other means, and considers such practices to be incon­
        sistent with fair judicial procedure and that they ought not to be permitted
        in any federal court.


                         REVISION OF THE LAWS
      Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on
    Revision of the Laws, submitted a comprehensive Committee
    report.
                               SERVICE OF PROCESS

       H.R. 6323, 87th Congress, would extend the territorial limits
    with respect to service of process in certain civil actions by provid­
    ing that in any case in which a civil action against more than one
    defendant is properly instituted in a judicial district in which at
    least one defendant resides, any process issued in such action with
(   respect to a defendant who does not reside within such judicial
    district may be served in the judicial district in which he resides
    or wherever he may be found. The bill purports to be a regulation
    of service of process and not of venue. It was the view of the
    Committee that the objectives of the bill could more properly be
    attained by an amendment to Rule 4, Federal Rules of Civil Pro­
    cedure, and that if by implication the bill would amend the venue
    statutes, it would do so casually and ambiguously and would tend
    to encourage forum shopping. Upon recommendation of the
    Committee, the Conference disapproved the bill.

                                STUDY OF VENUE

       Judge Maris reported that the Subcommitee appointed to study
    the subject of venue had given consideration to various aspects of
    the problem and had concluded that a need exists for liberalizing
    the venue statutes, and that consideration should also be given to
    liberalizing the rules in regard to service of process. The Commit­
    too, therefore, recommended the following amendments to subsec­
    tions (a) and (b) of 28 U.S.C. 1391, to authorize civil actions to
                                  10 

be brought in the district in which the claim arose, as well as in the
district of the residence of a party:
        (a) A civil action wherein jurisdiction is founded only on
     diversity of citizenship may, except as otherwise provided by
     law, be brought only in the judicial district where all plaintiffs
     or all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose.
        (b) A civil action wherein jurisdiction is not founded solely
     on diversity of citizenship may be brought only in the judicial
     district where all defendants reside, or in which the claim
     arose, except as otherwise. provided by law.
  The Conference approved the recommendations of the Commit­
tee and referred the following proposed amendment to Rule 4,
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the Committee on Rules of
Practice and Procedure for consideration by the Advisory Com­
mittee on Civil Rules in the light of the broadened venue provision
above proposed:
        Whenever it shall appear to the court before which any
     proceeding may be pending that the ends of justice require
     that other parties should be brought before the court, the court
     may cause them to be summoned, whether they reside in the
     state in which the court is held or not; and summons to that         (
     end may be served in any district by the marshal thereof.
   The Committee was granted leave to continue its study of the
subject of venue and in particular to consider proposed amendments
to 28 U.S.C. 1404(a), and 1406(a), and to report to a later session
of the Conference.

               FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

  R.R. 1561, 87th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 2072 to pro­
vide that amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
adopted by the Supreme Court shall not take effect until the
expiration of one year after they have been reported to Congress by
the Chief Justice. The present law provides for a waiting period
of only three months. It was the view of the Committee that the
present law affords adequate time within which Congress may
repeal or postpone the effective date of any proposed rule and that
the lengthening of this period to one year would be unwise. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved
the bill.
                                                                          (   )
                                 11 


                          EXPEDITING ACT 

  The Conference, on recommendation of the Committee, disap­
proved the proposal that the testimony in a civil antitrust case in
which an expediting certificate has been filed by the Attorney
General be taken before a single district judge rather than a district
court of three judges.

                      REMOVAL JURISDICTION
  Judge Maris reported that a subcommittee had been appointed
to study the operation of the procedure prescribed by Chapter 89
of Title 28, United States Code, for the removal of cases from state
to federal courts. This study was approved by the Conference.

                 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT
   S. 1887, and H.R. 9926, 87th Congress, to recodify Chapter 19
of Title 5, United States Code, entitled "Administrative Proce­
dure," were referred to the Committee on Revision of the Laws
for study and report to the Conference.

                CIRCUIT LEGISLATIVE CoMMITTEES
   Judge Maris informed the Conference that the Committee was
endeavoring to establish and maintain a liaison with the judicial
conferences of the circuits and particularly with the legislative
committees of the conferences in those circuits in which such com­
mittees are under appointment. This will enable the Committee
to have the benefit of the views of the local committees with respect
to legislative proposals under consideration.

        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
   The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice
and Procedure, Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, informed the Con­
ference concerning the progress of the rules program. Judge Maris
stated that in October proposed amendments to the Rules of Civil
Procedure were released to the bench and bar and that comments
concerning them are being received by the Committee. These
comments will be considered again by the Advisory Committee
     642363-62-8
                                12 

early next summer. An exhaustive repDrt by the Special CDmmit­
tee appointed to cDnsider the advisability Df uniform Rules of Evi­
dence has alSo. been circulated, and the Special Committee will
meet shDrtly to. consider CDmments with respect to that report.
The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules is cDnsidering the
possibility Df a merger Df the Rules of Civil Procedure and the Ad­
miralty Rules and will consider this in late summer.
  It was brDught to the attentiDn of the CDnference that the funds
prDvided fDr the work Dn the Rules of Practice and Procedure have
prDven inadequate and that a supplemental appropriatiDn will be
necessary to. finance the wDrk Df the Committee during the last
three mDnths Df the current fiscal year. After full cDnsideratiDn
the CDnference thereupDn adDpted the foliDwing resolutiDn:
        The Judicial Conference Df the United States, at its sessiDn
     in March 1962, has reviewed the wDrk Df the AdvisDry Com­
     mittees Dn Civil, Criminal, Admiralty, Bankruptcy, and Ap­
     pellate Rules, and the special CDmmittee Dn Rules Df
     Evidence, all appointed in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 331.
        The Conference is impressed with the continued need for
     the improvement of judicial procedure to meet the ever­
     mounting caseloads of the courts, and with the excellent prog­
                                                                       (
     ress being made by the Advisory Committees in this field, as
     well as the efficient and economical manner in which the whole
     program is being conducted. Moreover, the Conference re­
     cords its gratitude for the time and care which busy judges,
     lawyers, and legal scholars are devoting to this work.
        The Conference is very much concerned, however, lest the
     work of the Rules Committees be interrupted, and even per­
     manently impeded, by inadequate funds. Therefore, the Con­
     ference takes especial note of the present situation in that
     regard, and respectfully urges the Congress to expedite the
     appropriation of the additional funds which are needed to
     insure the uninterrupted continuance of the Rules undertak­
     ing which the Conference is required by law to carryon.

             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
              SALARIES AND POSITIONS OF REFEREES

  In the absence of Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the
Committee on Bankruptcy Administration, the report of the Com­
                                13 

mittee was presented to the Conference by Mr. Royal E.. Jackson,
Assistant Chief of the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative
Office.
   The Conference was informed that the Committee had met and
considered the recommendations contained in the report of the
Director of the Administrative Office, dated January 19, 1962,
relating to the continuance of referee positions to become vacant
prior to October 1, 1962, by expiration of term, for changes in
salaries of referees, changes in arrangements, and the creation of
new referee positions. The Committee also considered the recom­
mendations of the district judges and the judicial councils of the
circuits concerned.
   The Conference considered fully the Committee's report, as well
as the recommendations of the Director, the circuit councils, and
the district judges. On the basis of these reports, the Conference
took the action shown in the following table relating to changes in
salaries and new referee positions and directed that, unless other­
wise noted, this action become effective on July 1, 1962, provided
appropriated funds are available:

                         BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION

   (1) S. 1624 and H.R. 7403, to amend Section 77 of the Bank­
ruptcy Act and Section 20b of the Interstate Commerce Act re­
lating to the reorganization of railroads.-The Conference deferred
action on the proposals relating to railroad reorganizations con­
tained in these bills pending further study by the members of the
Conference.
   (2) H.R. 2040 to amend Section 17a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act,
11 U.S.C. 35(a) (2), to prohibit the discharge of debts and obliga­
                                18 

tions of which moral turpitude is the basis.-The Committee re­
ported that the need for this bill has not been demonstrated and !
recommended disapproval on the basis that it is too indefinite and
uncertain in its language. This recommendation was approved
by the Conference.
   (3) H.R. 9191 to amend Section 64a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act,
11 U.S.C. 104(a) (2), to give priority to payments due to any fund
or plan established for the purpose of providing employee bene­
fits.-It was the view of the Committee that the proposal contained
in the bill concerns a matter of public policy on which the Con­
ference should express no opinion. Accordingly, the Committee
recommended that no action be taken. This recommendation was
approved by the Conference.

    SCHEDULE OF SPECIAL CHARGES. UNDER SECTION         40c(3)
   A proposal has been made to authorize the refund of the $10
filing fee for filing either a reclamation petition or a petition for
review, if the petitioner is successful. The Committee considered
the proposal and recommended that no change be made in the
schedule of special charges under Section 40c(3) of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U.S.C. 68(c) (3). This recommendation was approved by (
the Conference.

     PRIORITY OF WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION PREMIUMS

  The Conference, on recommendation of the Committee, disap­
proved the proposal to amend the Bankruptcy Act to give priority
to claims in bankruptcy cases for workmen's compensation
premiums owed by the bankrupt.
   ApPOINTMENT OF RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES AND AUDIT OF
                      STATISTICAL REPORTS

  The Administrative Office had reported to the Committee that
the audit of statistical reports of closed asset cases has failed to
bring to light any monopoly situations with reference to the ap­
pointment of receivers and trustees. It has come to the attention.
of the Administrative Office and the Committee, however, that
the rules for the determination of net proceeds realized and of pay­
ments under Section 40c(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
                                 19 

68(c)(2), as promulgated by the Judicial Conference at its May
1947 session, have been subject to varying interpretations by the
referees. As a result, the determinations of the amounts to be paid
into the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund lack uniformity.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference directed
that a study be undertaken by the Administrative Office with a
view to recommending clarifying revisions of this regulation.

            RETffiEMENT AND SALARIES OF REFEREES

   H.R. 5341, 87th Congress, would amend the Bankruptcy Act to
increase the maximum salary limitation for full-time and part-time
referee positions and to liberalize the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Act with reference to the terms of office and the retirement of ref­
erees. The bill, which embodies the recommendations of the Con­
ference (Conf. Rept., September 1961, p. 88) is now pending before
the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. The
Conference reaffirmed its approval of this legislation, and author­
ized the Administrative Office to request that the proposals con­
tained in the bill be considered separately, if that appears
appropriate.

      ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW

  The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law, Judge William F. Smith, presented the report of the
Committee.

    PAYMENT OF CoMPENSATION TO CoUNSEL ApPOINTED            To
         REPRESENT POOR PERsONS ACCUSED OF         CRIME
   The Committee had given consideration to various bills to pro­
vide for the payment of compensation to counsel appointed to
represent indigent persons accused of crime, including S. 655, S.
854, S. 1484, and H.R. 2696, 87th Congress, and prepared a draft
of a bill which is basically a modification of H.R. 2696. This draft
bill was subsequently introduced in Congress as S. 2900, 87th
Congress.
  The draft bill prepared by the Committee proposes the following
modifications of H.R. 2696 :
                                  20 

       (a) A provision authorizing the court to appoint a public
    defender to represent a defendant in an "unpopular" cause.
       (b) The elimination of the requirement of 5 years' experi­
    ence for assistant public defenders. This qualification is
    retained for public defenders.
       (c) The elimination of the provision permitting grants to
    legal aid societies providing free legal services to indigent
    persons in the federal courts.
       (d) The elimination of any restriction on the right of the
    defendant to have the public defender represent him on appeal.
  The Conference considered the proposal at length and on recom­

 mendation of the Committee voted to approve S. 2900. 


                       CoNFLICTS OF INTEREST

     H.R. 8140, 87th Congress, would revise and strengthen the laws
  dealing with bribery, graft, and conflicts of interest. The bill pro­
  hibits any "officer or employee of the United States in the executive,
  legislative, or judicial branch of the Government" from serving as
  an attorney in connection with "any proceeding, application, re­
  quest for ruling or other determination, contract, claim, contro­
  versy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which ( .
  the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest."
  The Committee pointed out that these provisions would preclude
  any part-time United States commissioner, who is also an attorney
  in private practice, from handling any federal matter in the course
  of his private practice and would probably prompt the resignation
  of attorneys who are now serving as part-time commissioners. The
  Committee recommended therefore that the bill be disapproved
. insofar as it applies to part-time United States commissioners.
    It was the view of the Conference, however, that when United 

  States commissioners handle judicial matters, there should be some 

  restriction upon them in regard to conflicts of interest. Accord­

  ingly, the Committee was authorized to give, further consideration 

  to this problem. 


                MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

  S. 2619, 87th Congress, would amend Sections 4208 and 4209 

of Title 18, U.S.C., with respect to the imposition of mandatory 

minimum sentences. On recommendation of the Committee, and 

                                                                         (
                                 21 

consistent with the established policy of the Conference concern­
ing mandatory minimum sentences, the Conference approved the
bill.
      OBSERVATION AND STUDY OF JUVENILE DELINQUENTS

   S. 1691, 87th Congress, would amend 18 U.S.C. 5034, to authorize
the commitment of a juvenile delinquent for observation and study
prior to the imposition of sentence. The provisions of the bill are
similar to those contained in 18 U.S.C. 4208(b) relating to com­
mitment for observation and study prior to the imposition of
sentence. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference approved the bill.

                ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES

   The Committee reported favorably on S. 2879, 87th Congress,
which would provide for the appellate review of any sentence to a
term of imprisonment in excess of 5 years on the ground that the
sentence, although within lawful limits, is excessive. The Confer­
ence discussed the proposal at length and after full consideration
directed that it be made available for discussion at circuit confer­
ences and, with this understanding, referred the matter back to the
Committee.
                   INDETERMINATE SENTENCES

  The Committee reported that R.R. 3228, 87th Congress, would
add anew subsection to 18 U.S.C. 4208, as follows:
       (e) When a judgment of conviction is entered and sentence
    is imposed for less than life but for more than 5 years upon a
    defendant who has had no prior judgment of conviction en­
    tered against him, if the trial judge who imposed the sentence
    is a resident of a state other than that in which the court hav­
    ing jurisdiction is located and the court failed to receive or to
    require a report touching the defendant from the United States
    Probation Office in the district before imposing sentence and
    failed to designate in the sentence, as permitted under subsec­
    tion (a), when the defendant should become eligible for pa­
    role, such defendant shall be eligible for parole at such time as
    the Board of Parole may determine and upon request of such
                                 22 

     defendant an immediate study shall be undertaken and made
     as described in subsection (c).
   It was the opinion of the Committee that this proposal was de­
sirable, but that it should be made applicable to all cases where the
sentencing judge fails to receive or require a presentence report
and not merely to those cases where the sentencing judge is a resi­
dent of a state other than that in which the court having jurisdic­
tion is located. The Conference thereupon approved the
recommendation of the Committee that the bill be approved with
the omission of the limitation on its applicability.

                           INTERPRETERS

   S. 2617, 87th Congress, would provide for the designation of qual­
ified interpreters to assist defendants who are unable because of
deafness to understand. proceedings in Federal criminal actions.
The compensation of the interpreter would be fixed by the court
and would be paid out of public funds. It was brought to the at­
tention of the Conference that the proposal to authorize the pay­
ment of the fees of interpreters had previously been approved in
principle by the Conference (Conf. Rept., September 1961, p. 70),       ( \
and that proposed amendments to Rule 28, Federal Rules of Crim­
inal Procedure, and Rule 44, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to
authorize such appointments, had been referred to the Standing
Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure. The proposal
contained in S. 2617 was therefore referred to the Committee on
Rules of Practice and Procedure.

                  DESK BOOK FOR SENTENCING

  The Conference approved the following recommendations of
the Committee with respect to the distribution of the revised
Desk Book for Sentencing, dated April 1961:
       (a) That the Desk Book be made available in its present
    form to all district judges.
       (b) That the distribution of the Desk Book be under the
    authorization of the Committee on the Administration of
    the Criminal Law.
       ( c) That any proposed revision or modification of the
    Desk Book, whether solicited or unsolicited, be referred to
    the Committee for study, and that no revision or modifica­          (   :
                               23 

    tion is to be adopted without the approval of the Committee.
       Cd) That Judicial Conference approval of the Desk Book,
    or any revision thereof, is not required as a prerequisite to
    distribu tion.

                  INSTITUTES ON SENTENCING

  Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard of the Second Circuit had
submitted to the Committee through Judge Irving R. Kaufman
a request for Conference approval of an Institute on Sentencing
to be held in New York City on May 5, 1962. The Conference
was advised that the program submitted to and considered by
the Committee was in accordance with the requirements of the
Statute, 28 U.S.C. 334. The Conference thereupon authorized
the convening of the Institute on Sentencing in accordance with
the plan and program presented to the Committee.

                    INDIAN TRIBAL COURTS

  The Conference deferred action on the proposal contained in
S. 2612 to provide for the appointment of Indian tribal court
judges by the judges of the district courts, pending further study
of the proposal by the Committee and by the members of the
Conference.
                SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
 The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Personnel,
Chief Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report of the Com­
mittee to the Conference.

                       COURT OF CLAIMS

   The Conference at its September 1961 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 74) referred to the Committee on Supporting Personnel the
legislative proposals of the Court of Claims to authorize the
appointment by the Court of additional trial commissioners as
needed, not to exceed a total of twenty and to provide for the
trial commissioners the same type of retirement system as is now
applicable to the judges of The Tax Court of the United States.
The Committee recommended that the Conference approve the
seeking of legislation to provide for an increase in the number
of commissioners in the Court of Claims, as requested, up to a
                                 24 


maximum 'Of twenty and to provide fDr the retirement of commis­
siDners and for payment 'Of amDunts to their widows and certain        {

of their dependents in a manner similar to provisions made for
judges of the Tax Court. The recommendation was approved by
the Conference.
                       CDURT REPDRTERS
   Some years ago the Conference had authDrized cDmbination
positions of court reporter-secretary fDr the district judges in the
territories of Guam and the Virgin Islands. Because 'Of the press
'Of business and 'Other conditions, the judges in both courts have
submitted requests tD the Administrative Office for authority to
appoint both a secretary and a court reporter. UpDn the recom­
mendatiDn of the Committee, the CDnference separated the po­
sitions of court repDrter-secretary in the districts 'Of Guam and
the Virgin Islands and authDrized the appointment of a CDurt
reporter in each district at a salary of $7,000 per annum.

                   PAY INCREASE LEGISLATION
  It was brought to the attention of the Conference that pay
increase legislation fDr federal emplDyees, now under consideration    (\
in the CDngress, contemplates not only pay increases but a gen­
eral revision of the entire salary structure. Merely to include
the suppDrting personnel 'Of the courts in the pending legislation
fDr the purpose of according them the benefits 'Of any salary in­
creases may, therefore, have the effect of placing them within
a new salary structure. The Conference thereupon authDrized
the Administrative Office, with the assistance of the Committee
on Supporting Personnel, t.o seek to have the Judicial Salary
Plan, recently approved by the CDnference, included as a part
of H.R. 10480, 87th Congress, or in any event to secure an appro­
priate authorization for increasing the salaries of the suppDrting
personnel of the courts in an amount that would be relatively
the same as any salary increase granted to other Government
employees.
                     PRETRIAL PROGRAM
                                                                            .
  The Chairman 'Of the Committee 'On Pretrial Procedure, Chief
Judge Alfred P. Murrah, repDrted that, in accDrdance with the
resolution 'Of the Conference at its September 1961 sessiDn (Conf.
                                  25 


 Rept., p. 101), the first in a series of three seminars for new judges
 was held in Monterey, California, during the week of February 12,
 1962. Twenty-eight judges recently appointed to district courts in
 the Seventh through the Tenth Circuits and in Texas and Louisiana
were present. A group of 15 experienced trial judges served as
 discussion leaders and participated actively in all phases of the
seminar. The seminar program was similar in organization to
 the seminar programs conducted in Boulder, Colorado, in 1960, and
in Dallas, Texas, in 1961, and, in addition, embodied topics sug­
gested for discussion by those new district judges who responded
to a questionnaire from the Committee. Ample time was allowed
for general discussion and every new judge was afforded an
opportunity for questions.
   Judge Murrah informed the Conference that the second seminar
for new district judges was scheduled to be held in Norfolk, Vir­
ginia, during the week of April 30, and the third in Dearborn, Mich­
igan, during the week of August 20. The new district judges in the
Third, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits (except Louisiana and Texas)
have been invited to Norfolk, and those in the First, Second, and
Sixth Circuits will be invited to Dearborn. District judges whose
appointments are made after the Monterey and Norfolk Sem­
inars will also be invited to attend the seminar at Dearborn. It
was the expressed desire of the Committee that every newly ap­
pointed district judge be afforded an opportunity to attend and
participate in one of the seminars.

           SUBCOMMITTEE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION

   Chief Judge Murrah informed the Conference that the Sub­
committee of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure appointed
to consider discovery problems arising in multiple litigation with
common witnesses and exhibits had met and had given considera­
tion primarily to the problems presented by the large volume of
antitrust treble damage actions recently filed throughout the
country, which have arisen out of the criminal proceedings in the
electrical equipment industry in Philadelphia last year. In many
jurisdictions these cases have already been assigned to a single
judge as suggested in the Handbook of Recommended Procedures
for the Trial of Protracted Cases. The subcommittee reported
that it has arranged for a meeting of the judges to whom the
                                26 

cases have been assigned in Philadelphia on March 22, 1962, to
consider various procedural problems. The Conference thereupon        (. 

adopted the following resolution:
        That the Conference desires to express its approval and
     encouragement of the forthcoming meetings of judges aimed
     to effect voluntary coordinating procedures in processing the
     civil antitrust cases in the electrical equipment industry.

       INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
   The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Intercircuit As­
signments, Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported on the processing
of requests for intercircuit assignments.
                                                                              'II'
   The Committee in accordance with subdivision III(lO) of the
plan for the assignment of judges, approved by the Conference at
its March 1960 session, had prepared and distributed to the mem­
bers of the Conference a statement relating to the needs for out­
of-circuit assistance and to the availability of judges for such
service. Since its last report, the Committee has recommended
favorably on 20 intercircuit assignments, all of which have been
approved by the Chief Justice. No adverse recommendation has
been made. The judges receiving intercircuit assignments during       (   )
this period include six circuit judges, three district judges, four
senior circuit judges, and six senior district judges.
   The Committee reported that in one instance a request has
been made to furnish a judge for the trial of a protracted case,
but that it was not able to fill this request. This sustains the
belief of the Committee that, except in extraordinary circum­
stances and except when a senior judge is willing to undertake
such an assignment, it is better judicial administration to have a
protracted case handled by a local judge and for outside assistance
to be provided for work which the local judge is unable to do at
the time.
   It has been the experience of the Committee that it is virtually
impossible to be of assistance when a request involves immediate
service. A judge's work is usually planned far in advance and
except in emergencies the practical working of any plan for inter­
circuit assignments requires the projection of both needs and
availabilities for a reasonable length of time in the future.
   The Committee suggested, therefore, that the chief judges of
the circuits carefully reappraise the situation in their circuits.
                                     27 

     Disparities in the amount of judicial business of the various cir­
     cuits and districts have existed, now exist, and will occur in the
     future and it is to the benefit of the federal judicial system to
     utilize the available judgepower of the nation to the fullest extent
     possible consistent with the primary obligation of judges to their
     respective circuits and districts. The Committee accordingly
     called attention to the desirability of re-evaluation of needs and
     availabilities in each circuit and of advance planning which will
     facilitate the synchronization of need with availability.
       The report of the Committee was received and approved by
     the Conference.

                  TRAVEL EXPENSES OF JUDGES
        The Conference at its September 1961 session (Con£. Rept.,
     p. 72) directed that the limitation of $25 per day on the traveling
     expenses of judicial employees traveling on an actual expense
     basis remain unchanged, even though the revision of the Travel
     Expense Act had permitted an increase in the actual travel expense
     allowance to $30 per day. It was brought to the attention of the
     Conference that 28 U.S.C. 456 in regard to the traveling expenses
(	   of justices and judges provides for "reimbursement for his actual
     expenses of subsistence not in excess of the maximum amount fixed
     by the Travel Expense Act of 1949, as amended." It thus appears
     that the statute is self-executing and that an administrative reg­
     ulation is not authorized by law. The Conference, after full
     consideration, voted to rescind its former action with regard to
     the reimbursement of the expenses of judges traveling on an
     actual expense basis.

                 FEES OF LAND COMMISSIONERS
        Mr. Olney brought to the attention of the Conference, the
     stated intention of the Administrative Assistant Attorney General
     to eliminate from the 1964 Budget Estimates of the Department
     of Justice any request for funds for the fees of land commissioners
     appointed under Rule 71A(h), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
     The Conference was also informed that a special subcommittee
     of the Committee on Public Works of the House of Representa­
     tives has undertaken a study of existing laws, practices, and

required for federal and federally assisted programs which will
include a study of the use of land commissioners. The Conference (
thereupon adopted the following resolution:
  Whereas the Committee on Public Works of the House of Representatives
has recently created a Select Subcommittee on Real Property Acquisition, of
which Congressman Clifford Davis of Tennessee is Chairman; and
  Whereas the Subcommittee was established to make an objective study of
existing laws, practices and procedures in the acquisition and evaluation of
real property required for Federal and federally assisted programs to deter­
mine whether they are unfair either to property owners because of inadequate
payments or to the taxpayers because of overpayments, and to produee a con­
sidered report with sound recommendations and legislative proposals, if
appropriate; and
  Whereas the work of the Subcommittee will include a study of the use of
land commissioners appOinted under Rule 71A(h) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, including their compensation; and
  Whereas the Administrative Assistant Attorney General has written a letter
to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts under
date of February 14, 1962, stating that it is his intention to eliminate from the
1964 budget estimates the item for land commissioners' fees, which in former
years has been included in the Department of Justice budget:
  Be it resolved, That the Judicial Conferenee of the United States requests
the Attorney General to include in the 1964 budget estimates for the Department
of Justice and in the budget of the Department in subsequent years the item
for land 'Commissioners' fees, as in prior years, and continue such budgeting
until the Davis Select Subcommittee on Real Property Acquisition has com­            (   1,
pleted its studies and made its report, recommendations and legislative proposals.
