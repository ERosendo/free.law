sessions of the conference may be called by the Chief Justice at such times
 and places as he may designate.
   The district judge to be summoned from each judicial circuit shall be
chosen by the circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual judicial
conference of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 of this title and shall
serve as a member of the conference for three successive years, except that
in the year following the enactment of this amended section the judges in the

unjustifiable expense and delay shall be recommended by the Conference from
time to time to the Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modi­
fication or rejection, in accordance with law.

        COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY OF
       THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
   Honorable Emanuel Celler, Chairman of the Commit­
tee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, in­
                                                                         (~
                                  3

      formed the Conference that the Committee desires to
   "- proceed promptly with a survey of the geographical or­
(( 	 ganization of the entire federal judicial system, to be
      made in the light of population increases and economic
      changes and to include a study of the adequacy of the pres­
      ent number of places of holding court. There has been
      no general revision in the boundaries of judicial circuits
      since 1910 and unforeseen pockets of litigation have de­
      veloped. This has resulted in the introduction in Congress
      of a number of bills to change circuit and district lines
      and add numerous places of holding court. The need for
      an over-all survey has thus become imperative. The Com­
      mittee on the Judiciary desires to cooperate fully with
      the Judicial Conference subcommittee in the considera­
      tion of these problems and Congressman Celler requested
      that an organizational meeting for the survey be held
      promptly.
           REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
   .. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, on invitation of
 ( }he Chief Justice, spoke to the Conference informally on
  . matters relating to the work of the Department of Justice.
     He informed the Conference that the Department was
     current in selecting judges to be nominated by the
     President to fill judicial vacancies. Of the 144 judgeship
     vacancies occurring since January 1961, including the 73
     new judgeships provided by the Omnibus Judgeship Act,
     120 have been filled and a number of nominations are now
     pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
       The Attorney General informed the Conference that the
     draft of a jury commission bill, worked out in conference
     by representatives of the Department of Justice and the
     Committee on the Operation of the Jury System, was
     satisfactory to the Department. He also informed the
     Conference of the appointment of a special committee to
     consider the cost of furnishing legal services to indigent
     criminal defendants. The Conference was assured that the
     Department of Justice would cooperate fully in the pro­

gram to reduce the number of civil cases pending in the
district courts more than three years, particularly in "
respect to land condemnation and tax cases.             ,    j'
REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRA­
 TIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   Warren Olney, III, Director of the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts, had previously sub­
mitted to the members of the Conference his report for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1962, in accordance with
the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 604(a) (3). The Conference
approved the immediate release of the report for publica­
tion and authorized the Director to revise and supplement
the final printed edition to be issued later.
                STATE OF THE DOCKETS
   Courts of Appeals-Cases filed in the Courts of Appeals
during the fiscal year 1962 increased sharply to a record
4,823 cases, an increase of 374 over the previous year.
The increase this year is actually larger due in part to ~
change in statistical procedures under which cross appeal~j
are counted as separate cases. The net increase in cases
commenced is a little more than 8 percent. The cases dis­
posed of in 1962 were 4,167, which is 656 less than the
number filed. The pending backlog thus increased to a
record 3,031 cases on June 30, 1962.
   District Courts-Civil cases filed in the United States
district courts were 61,836, an increase of approximately
6 percent over the 58,293 civil cases filed during 1961.
Civil cases disposed of were 57,996, or 3,840 less than the
number filed; and the number of pending civil actions
increased to 67,968 at the end of the year, an increase of
approximately 6 percent.
   The increase in civil cases this year is due in part to
the filing of 1,741 private antitrust actions against elec­
trical equipment manufacturing companies, as an out­
growth of the criminal antitrust proceedings in this

                                                       c.·

      industry in Philadelphia during 1961. All but two of these
(     cases  were still pending at the end of the year.
         The median time interval from filing to disposition of
      civil cases terminated by trial in the district courts in
      1962 was 16.6 months compared with 16.5 months in 1961.
      The median time interval from issue to trial decreased to
      10.4 months compared with 11.2 months in 1961. Fifteen
      district courts had a median time interval from issue to
      trial of six months or less.
         Criminal proceedings were instituted against a total
      of 36,108 defendants during 1962; charges against
      34,638 defendants were disposed of during the year; and
      on June 30, 1962 there were 12,910 defendants awaiting
      trial or sentence. The pending figure includes 1,399 de­
      fendants who on that date had been fugitives for six
      months or more, or were serving in the armed forces.
         For the sixth consecutive year, bankruptcy cases filed
      reached an all-time peak. Total filings were 147,780, an
      increase of 1,137 cases, or about 1 percent. This in the
  ( 	 flmallest increase in filings in 10 years. A record 137,709
  , 	 cases were closed during the year, or 19,766 more than last
      year. Nevertheless, filings exceeded terminations by
      more than 10,000 cases and the pending caseload increased
      to an all-time high of 133,761.

             SURVEY OF JUDICIAL BUSINESS
       The Conference received reports from the Chief Judge
    of the Court of Claims, the Chief Judge of the Court of
    Customs and Patent Appeals, and from the Chief Judges
    of the respective circuits, concerning the state of the dock­
    ets in their courts and circuits. These reports were supple­
    mented by the district judges who presented additional
    details concerning the business of the district courts of the
    circuits. The Conference was informed that the program
    of seminars for new district judges, authorized by the
    Conference at its last session, had been well received by the
    new judges and had been very effective in acquainting them
                             6

with the problems arising in the operation of a district
court.
   The Conference was also informed that in accordance
with the plan and policy adopted by the Conference in
September 1961, considerable progress had been made in
most districts in the disposition of the civil actions pend­
ing more than three years. It is anticipated that further
progress will be made in the coming year, now that most
of the judgeship positions provided by the recent Omnibus
Judgeship Act have been filled.
     RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
   The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Rules of
Practice and Procedure, Senior Judge Albert B. Maris,
presented to the Conference the recommendations of the
Committee and a progress report of the work and activi­
ties of the standing committee and the advisory commit­
tees on the rules of practice and procedure.

          ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CIVIL RULES                (
   The Advisory Committee on Civil Rules had submitted ~
to the Committee, with its favorable recommendation, a
definitive draft of proposed amendments to certain federal
rules of civil procedure, together with committee notes
and an explanatory statement. The proposed amendments
were fully discussed and considered by the standing com­
mittee and approved with one modification involving the
last sentence of the proposed amendment to Rule 58, re­
lating to the entry of judgment. Upon recommendation of
the Committee the Conference approved the proposed
amendments to the rules of civil procedure and directed
that they be transmitted to the Supreme Court with a rec­
ommendation that they be adopted.
      ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON ADMIRALTY RULES
  The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules has given
primary consideration to the desirablilty of unifying or ~.
                                                           (
                             7


integrating the admiralty rules and the rules of civil pro­
cedure and has concluded that unification, with the in­
clusion of certain rules dealing with special admiralty
proceedings, is both feasible and desirable. The standing
committee accepted and approved the action of the advi­
sory committee and recommended to the Conference that
unification of the civil and admiralty rules, with the in­
clusion of certain rules dealing with special admiralty
proceedings, be approved. The Committee also recom­
mended that the Conference request the Supreme Court to
consider the proposal and indicate its views thereon,
so that the Committee may be free to proceed with the
task of preparing a draft of the unified civil and admiralty
rules, as proposed. These recommendations were approved
by the Conference.
     ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON BANKRUPTCY RULES

  Judge Maris reported that the Advisory Committee on
Bankruptcy Rules is proceeding with its study of the gen­
eral orders and official forms in bankruptcy, but has no
definitive proposals for amendments to submit at this
time.
      ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL RULES

   The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is also pro­
ceeding with its study of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure. Tentative recommendations for amendments
to certain rules are under consideration, but no definitive
proposals for amendments are ready for submission.
     ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON ApPELLATE RULES

  The Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules has pre­
pared a second draft of a proposed rule for the review of
the decisions of the Tax Court, which has been circulated
to the bench and bar. Comments on this draft are still
being received.
                                8

   The advisory committee is also engaged in a compre­
hensive study of appellate procedure in the United States
courts of appeals and in preparing a tentative draft of
uniform rules in this field. In view of the fact that the
advisory committee is engaged in a wholly new undertak­
ing in this field, the standing committee has requested
that drafts of rules in related or integrated groups be
submitted when they have been approved, rather than
postpone their submission until the full draft of all the
rules has been completed.
      SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON RULES OF EVIDENCE

   The Chairman of the Special Committee on Uniform
Rules of Evidence for the Federal courts, Professor James
W. Moore, reported that the preliminary report of the
committee, recommending that uniform rules of evidence
for the Federal courts be formulated and adopted, had
been widely circulated to the bench and bar. It is antici­
pated that in January 1963 the special committee will
reach a definitive conclusion on this matter, after con- ( ,
sidering the comments received. Professor Moore reported ~
that comments so far received have been overwhelmingly
favorable to the project.
                  MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

   The Committee reported that it had given consideration
to delimiting more precisely the area of work of the Advi­
sory Committee on Appellate Rules on the one hand and
the advisory committees on civil, admiralty, bankruptcy,
and criminal rules on the other hand, with respect to ap­
pellate procedure in the district courts. After full consid­
eration, the following statement was adopted by the
standing committee for the guidance of the advisory
committees:
    "The advisory committees in the fields of criminal, civil,
    admiralty and bankruptcy procedure should take primary
    responsibility for the study of all such procedure in the dis­
                                     9

         trict courts up to but not including the filing of a notice of
         appeal, or the form and manner of making up and transmit­
(	       ting the record on appeal or the procedure in the court of
         appeals after the appeal is lodged there, for all of which
         procedure the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules would
         bear primary responsibility. With respect to matters within
         its primary responsibility as defined each committee should,
         of course, welcome such suggestions as the other committees
         may desire to make as a result of their own studies. It is also
         to be understood that all proposals with respect to procedure
         between the filing of the notice of appeal and the docketing
         of the appeal in the appellate court are to be submitted by
         the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules to the appropriate
         other advisory committees and their views obtained before
         any proposal in that area is submitted to the Standing
         Committee."
        The Committee is also encouraging the advisory com­
     mittees to continue the practice, followed in the formula­
     tion of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, of making
     proposed rules and amendments thereto brief and general
     in scope, leaving large areas of discretion to the judges
     to deal with particular situations.

                 JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
        The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief
     Judge William J. Campbell, submitted to the Conference
     the appropriations estimates for the judiciary for the fiscal
     year 1964. The estimates, which had been prepared by the
     Director of the Administrative Office pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
     605 and which were examined and approved by the Com­
     mittee, totaled $61,064,600, an increase of $2,259,100 over
     the appropriations approved by the House of Represent­
     atives for the fiscal year 1963. At the time the appropria­
     tion estimates for the fiscal year 1964 were prepared,
     Congress had not completed action on the 1963 appropria­
     tion bill. On recommendation of the Committee, the ap­
     propriations estimates presented were approved by the
     Conference.
                            10 


   The Director of the Administrative Office was further
authorized to submit to Congress estimates of supplemen­
tal appropriations in the event of the enactment of the
Federal employees salary increase bill and for any pur­
pose which could not be anticipated at the time of this
submission.
   Judge Campbell pointed out that the Committee plans
to ask Congress in the fiscal year 1964 appropriation bill
for the full amount required to put into effect the Judiciary
Salary Plan previously approved by the Conference. In
view of the amount of funds required and the fact that
this request will follow a general salary increase, the Com­
mittee recommended that the submission of the request
for funds for the salary plan for the fiscal year 1964 be
approved and that any requests for additional supporting
personnel be postponed. This recommendation was ap­
proved by the Conference.
   At the request of Chief Judge Sylvester J. Ryan, the Con­
ference approved the inclusion in the appropriation re­
quests for 1964 of an item of $38,855, to continue the I
pretrial examiner program in the Southern District of'          ~
New York. The Conference directed the Administrative
Office to undertake an examination of the pretrial exam­
iner programs in the District of Columbia and in the
Southern District of New York and to report thereon to
the Committee on Court Administration.
   For the fiscal year 1963 the Conference had approved
the inclusion in the budget request of funds for 21 ad­
ditional positions in the Administrative Office on the basis
of the sizable increase in workload imposed by the recent
omnibus judgeship legislation. Five of the 21 requested
positions were allowed by the House of Representatives.
In conjunction with the Committee, the Administrative
Office decided not to appeal the reduction made by the
House, but to advise the Senate Appropriations Commit­
tee that it would first see what could be accomplished with
these five positions before asking for any additional funds.
                                  11 


    Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
    authorized the Director, either in a supplemental appro­
    priation or in the request for appropriations for the fiscal
    year 1964, to include any necessary funds to provide for
    a portion or all of the requested positions previously dis­
    allowed by the House. The Conference also approved the
    inclusion of $110,000 in the appropriations of the Admin­
    istrative Office to carryon the study of the rules of practice
    and procedure, which is the same amount approved by the
    House Appropriations Committee for the fiscal year 1963.

                 SUPPLEMENTAL ApPROPRIATIONS

       The Conference was informed that obligations incurred
    during the fiscal year 1962 incident to the creation of the
    new judgeships aggregated approximately $2,870,000, or
    $110,000 less than the sum provided by Congress. Although
    the over-all amount was adequate, it was necessary to re­
    quest authority to transfer a surplus of $100,000 in the
    appropriation for "Salaries of Supporting Personnel" to
(   the appropriation for the salaries of judges, to complete
    payment of compensation and related benefits for the
    services of judges rendered through June 30, 1962.
       During the fiscal year 1962 it was also necessary to re­
    quest supplemental appropriations aggregating $826,000
    for travel and miscellaneous expenses of the courts, fees of
    jurors and U.S. commissioners, expenses of referees in
    bankruptcy, and expenses of the Administrative Office.
    Action on these requests by Congress was not completed as
    of July 1962 and it was therefore necessary to suspend
    payments to U.S. commissioners.
       Chief Judge Campbell informed the Conference that
    the appropriation requests for the fiscal year 1963 have
    been approved by the House Appropriations Committee
    substantially as requested and no appeal has been made
    to the Senate Appropriations Committee for restoration
    of funds. However, the Committee has been requested to
                            12 


consider an amendment to the 1963 Appropriation Bill to
increase the amount approved by the House of Represent­
atives for fees of jurors and commissioners by $1,500,000
and to add a proviso to the text of the appropriation to
make $300,000 available for completion of payments to
U.S. commissioners for fees due for services rendered
during the fiscal year 1962.

                 COMMITTEE PROCEDURE

   In view of the importance of the timing of requests for
appropriations and in view of the fact that there are
several proposals before the Conference which would neces­
sitate requests for funds, the Committee requested author­
ity to arrange and time requests for items as approved by
the Conference so as, in its best judgment and that of the
Administrative Office, to assure success in obtaining funds.
The Committee made this request because at the present
time items approved by the Conference are presumed to
be for immediate release to the Congress. The Committee( ~..
does not wish to oppose the approval of items which the      j




Conference feels have merit, but does wish to have author­
ity to use its judgment in the timing of requests addressed
to the Congress, subject always, of course, to the approval
of the Conference. The request of the Committee was ap­
proved by the Conference.
   The Conference approved the report of the Committee
and authorized the immediate release of any information
contained therein as may be necessary in the preparation
and presentation of supplemental or annual appropriations
estimates to the Congress.

             COURT ADMINISTRATION
   The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administra­
tion, Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the report of
the Committee.

              ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS, DIVISIONS AND
                    PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

       The Conference considered the following proposals with
    reference to the creation of additional districts, divisions,
    and places of holding court:
       (1) S. 3156 and H.R. 11143, 87th Congress, to amend
    28 U.S.C. 142 to read as follows:
        "Court shall be held only at places where Federal quarters and
        accommodations are available, or suitable quarters and ac­
        comodations are furnished without cost to the United States.
        The foregoing restrictions shall not, however, preclude the
        Administrator of General Services at the request of the Di­
        rector of the Administrative Office of the United States
        Courts, from providing such court quarters and accommo­
        dations as the Administrator determines can appropriately
        be made available at places where regular terms of court
        are authorized by law to be held, but only if such quarters
        and accommodations have been approved as necessary by
        the Judicial Council of the appropriate circuit."
       It was the view of the Committee that this legislation
( 	 will place in the judicial councils of the circuits a measure
    of control over the places where court is to be held. Upon
    recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
    proved the proposal contained in S. 3156, as passed by the
    Senate.
       (2) H.R. 11678, 87th Congress, to waive the restric­
    tions of 28 U.S.C. 142 with respect to the holding of court
    at Akron in the Northern District of Ohio. The Judicial
    Council of the Sixth Circuit has recommended that suitable
    facilities for holding district court be provided in the new
    Federal building to be constructed in Akron. Upon recom­
    mendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
    bill.
       (3) S. 2864 and H.R. 10380 to establish Dickinson,
    Jamestown, Devils Lake and Williston as additional places
    of holding court in the District of North Dakota; H.R.
    7533 to divide North Dakota into two separate districts
    with additional places of holding court as set forth above;
                             14

and H.R. 6378 to establish Dickinson as an additional
place of holding court in North Dakota and to waive the (
provisions of 28 U.S.C. 142 in regard to holding court at
                                                                 I
Dickinson. The Judicial Council of the Eighth Circuit has
disapproved the creation of additional places of holding
court in the District of North Dakota on the ground that
they are unnecessary and not in the best interests of judi­
cial administration and economy. The Committee, there­
fore, recommended that S. 2864, H.R. 6378 and H.R.
10380 be disapproved; and that in accordance with the
settled policy of the Judicial Conference to disapprove
the creation of any new district, that H.R. 7533 also be
disapproved. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
   The Conference reviewed its procedure for the con­
sideration of legislation introduced in Congress with re­
gard to additional places of holding court and the waiving
of the limitations and restrictions of 28 U.S.C. 142 in
respect to places of holding court. Upon recommendation
of the Committee, the Conference directed the Adminis- ()
trative Office to refer all such legislation to the Judicial r
Councils of the circuits involved for their consideration,
and to transmit the recommendations of the Councils di­
rectly to the Chairmen of the Committees on the Judiciary
of the Senate and House of Representatives.

           JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT

   The Conference considered the proposal contained in
S. 3482, 87th Congress, which is a private bill to authorize
the payment of an annuity to the widow of a Federal judge
who, at the time of his death, had served four years and
eight months. The Annuity Act at present requires a
minimum of five years service. While sympathetic with
the purposes of the proposal, the Conference was of the
view that it presents a matter of policy for the deterniina­
tion of the Congress. The Conference, therefore, took no
action on the bill.
                                 15

           REORGANIZATION OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS

       The Conference at its September 1961 session (Conf.
    Rept., p. 66) deferred action on S. 1235 and H.R. 6851,
    87th Congress, to reorganize the Court of Claims by estab­
    lishing separate trial and appellate divisions. The Commit­
    tee reported that it has given no further study to the
    proposal contained in these bills and contemplates no
    further action.
       The proposal contained in S.· 3070, 87th Congress, to
    provide additional commissioners for the Court of Claims,
    was previously approved by the Conference at its March
    1962 session upon the recommendation of the Committee
    on Supporting Personnel (Conf. Rept., p. 23.) . The Com­
    mittee reported, therefore, that it no longer has this pro­
    posal before it for consideration.

                    COURT REPORTING SYSTEM

       The Committee presented to the Conference a proposed
(   amendment to 28 U.S.C. 753 (b) to permit the filing by
    court reporters of electronic sound recordings of arraign­
    ments, pleas and sentences in criminal cases in lieu of
    transcripts, as presently required. After full discussion,
    the Conference directed the Committee to undertake a
    further study of the proposed amendment in the light of
    the discussions in the Conference.
       The Committees on Court Administration and Support­
    ing Personnel were authorized to consider further the
    Conference regulations concerning fees to be paid to court
    reporters when file copies of transcripts are transmitted
    to the courts of appeals. This regulation was recently con­
    sidered by the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit in
    U.S. v. Benning, 295 F.2d 705. The Committees were also
    authorized to consider the proposal to increase the court
    reporter's fee for the use of a transcript in the preparation
    or perfection of an appeal from 25 cents to 30 cents per
    page and to conduct a full study of 28 U.S.C. 753(b).
                            16

  Pending further action by the Committees and by the
Conference, the Director of the Administrative Office was
authorized to continue salary payments to court reporters.
(See Conf. Rept., Sept. 1961, p. 70).

                SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES
   The Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 4) directed the Committee to consider further the pro­
posals contained in S. 1268, 87th Congress, relating to
 (1) the selection of chief judges of the circuits and of
mUltiple-judge district courts; (2) the terms of service
of chief judges; and (3) the powers and responsibilities
of chief judges with respect to the general administrative
superintendence of the business of the circuit and district
courts. The Committee reported that it had given further
consideration to these proposals but had not as yet arrived
at definite answers to the difficult questions presented.
The Committee was granted leave to consider the matter
further and to report at a later meeting of the Conference.
              GEOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION                       (   ~
   The Committee reported that the survey of the geo­
graphical organization of the entire Federal Judicial Sys­
tem to be made in the light of population increases and
economic changes and to include a study of the adequacy
of the present number of places of holding court, as re­
quested by Congressman Emanuel Celler, will require
statistical information with respect to the cases originat­
ing in each district court classified according to county
of origin within the district from a venue standpoint. This
information is not available in the Administrative Office.
A field study to secure the information will therefore be
necessary and the Administrative Office has neither funds
nor personnel available for this purpose. The Committee
therefore recommended that the Conference suggest to
Congressman Celler, that the Committee on the Judiciary
of the House of Representatives undertake such a statis­
                                                              (

    tical study for its own use and to enable the Judicial
    Conference to carry out the study of the geographical or­
    ganization of the courts heretofore requested by Congress­
    man Celler. This recommendation was approved by the
    Conference with the understanding that the Committee on
    Court Administration will cooperate with the House Com­
    mittee in the conduct of the survey.
                       FEES OF WITNESSES
      S. 2949, 87th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 1821
    and 1825 to increase the fees of witnesses from $4 to $6
    per day; increase the mileage allowance from 8 cents to
    10 cents per mile; and increase the subsistence allowance
    from $8 to $10 per day. The bill would also authorize
    the payment of witness' fees to Government witnesses on
    the certificate of a Government attorney in charge of the
    case or a grand jury proceeding, as well as the United
    States attorney, or an assistant United States attorney.
    On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
e   proved the proposal contained in the bill.

              DISBURSEMENT OF JUDICIARY FUNDS
      S. 2948 and H.R. 8304, 87th Congress, would amend
    28 U.S.C. 711 and 751 to provide that the clerks of the
    courts of appeals and district courts, respectively, subject
    to regUlations prescribed by the Director of the Adminis­
    trative Office, may disburse appropriated funds for the
    maintenance and operation of the courts. The Committee
    reported that it endorses the plan in principle, but that
    additional funds will be required to make it effective. Until
    the cost is ascertained, the Committee was authorized to
    consider the matter further and report at a later session
    of the Conference.
                          CLERKS' FEES
       The Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept.,
    p. 6) directed the Administrative Office to undertake a
                             18 


study of the existing fee schedules for clerks of court and
to report any suggested changes in fees to the Committee
                                                            (
on Court Administration. However, due to pressure of
business and lack of personnel, the Administrative Office
has been unable to complete these studies. The Committee
was therefore granted leave to consider the matter further
and to report to the Conference when the studies have been
completed.

                  PRETRIAL EXAMINERS

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, had authorized the employment of pretrial examiners
in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia on an experimental or trial basis. In September
1960 the Conference further authorized the inclusion in
the budget of funds for the inauguration of a similar
system in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and funds for these programs were
specifically included by the Congress in several Appropria- ."
tions Acts.                                                 ()
   It was the view of the Committee that an examination
should be made by the Administrative Office to determine
how efficiently these systems are working. The Conference
thereupon directed the Administrative Office to examine
the operation of the pretrial examiner systems in the
District of Columbia and in the Southern District of New
York and to report thereon to the Committee.

          STATE GRANTS TO FEDERAL JUDGES

  There was brought to the attention of the Committee a
proposal to have the State of New York supplement the
salaries of Federal judges in that State in an amount suffi­
cient to render the total compensation of such judges
equal to the corresponding salaries of State court judges
in the place where each Federal judge maintains an official
station within the State. It was the view of the Commit­
                                                               (
                                                                   ...<'

    tee, with one judge dissenting, that the plan presents
    an undesirable policy and raises serious constitutional
    questions. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
    Conference voted to oppose adoption of the plan.
                   REVISION OF THE LAWS
       Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Com­
    mittee on the Revision of the Laws, submitted the report
    of the Committee.
                      REMOVAL JURISDICTION

      Judge Maris reported that the subcommittee appointed
    to study the operation of the procedure prescribed by
    Chapter 89 of Title 28, United States Code, for the re­
    moval of cases from state to federal courts, had submitted
    an interim report and had been authorized to continue its
    study. It is anticipated that a final report will be completed
    in February.
(               ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT

       The Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept.,
    p. 11) had referred to the Committee S. 1887 and H.R.
    9926, 87th Congress, to recodify Chapter 19 of Title 5,
    United States Code, entitled "Administrative Procedure."
    The Conference considered fully the Committee's recom­
    mendation that it approve with certain amendments the
    provisions of Section 1009, for the judicial review of
    agency action and directed that the proposals contained
    in these bills be referred to both the Committee on Revision
    of the Laws and the Committee on Court Administration
    for further consideration in the light of the discussions
    in the Conference. The Committees were authorized to con­
    fine their consideration of these bills to the provisions with
    respect to judicial review.
       The proposal contained in S. 3410, 87th Congress, to
    amend Section 10 (a) of the Administrative Procedure
                              20 


Act, in regard to judicial review of agency action, was also
referred to the Committees for further study.
            CIRCUIT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES
   The Committee reported that it had given further con~
sideration to a procedure for establishing and maintaining
a liaison with the judicial conferences of the circuits and
particularly with the legislative committees of the con­
ferences in those circuits in which such committees have
been appointed. The Committee concluded that the most
feasible procedure is for the preliminary agenda for the
semi-annual meetings of the Committee to be transmitted
to the chief judge of each circuit for reference to the cir~
cuit legislative committee, if any, with an invitation to
submit to the Chairman of the Committee on Revision of
the Laws, prior to its ensuing meeting, any suggestions
or problems on which consideration is desired. Copies of
any bills or other documents referred to in the Committee
agenda will be available from the Administrative Office
upon request.
             COURT OF VETERANS' ApPEALS
   H.R. 10915, 87th Congress, would establish a Court of
Veterans' Appeals and prescribe its jurisdiction and func­
tions. Similar bills were considered by the Conference at its
September 1961 session (Conf. Rept., p. 78) and approved
as to the type of judicial review proposed, but disapproved
to the extent that they would amend 28 U.S.C. 451 and
610 to include the proposed new court among the courts
of the United States and to require the Director of the
Administrative Office to assume responsibility for its ad­
ministrative affairs. Upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee, the Conference reaffirmed its action with respect
to the proposals contained in H.R. 10915.
            VENUE AND TRANSFER OF CASES
  The Committee reported that H.R. 12027, 87th Con­
gress, would amend the venue statute, 28 U.S.C. 1391, in
                                  21 


    accordance with the recommendation of the Conference at
    its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept., p. 9). Upon recom­
    mendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
    bill.
       Judge Maris reported that the subcommittee appointed
    to study the subject of venue has continued to give con­
    sideration to various aspects of the problem, and in ad­
    dition has under consideration (1) a proposal to permit
    multiple claims arising out of a single occurrence, such
    as an airplane accident, to be consolidated for trial before
    one tribunal and (2) a proposal to broaden the venue re­
    quirements in suits to recover for frauds committed
    against the United States.
       It was the view of the Committee, however, that the
    enactment of H.R. 12027, above approved, and a possible
    broadening of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with
    respect to service of process may meet, in an appropriate
    general way, the problems involved in suits on multiple
    claims arising out of a single occurrence, as well as other
(   venue problems. The Committee also believed that this
    action may so modify the effect of the impact of HoJiman
    v. Blaski, 363 U.S. 335, upon 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) and
    1406 (a) as to render it unnecessary to amend those sec­
    tions. The Committee accordingly recommended that fur­
    ther consideration of legislative proposals relating to
    venue and service of process be deferred pending action
    by Congress on H.R. 12027, or its counterpart in the 88th
    Congress, and pending action by the Committee on Rules
    of Practice and Procedure upon proposals for the exten­
    sion of the right to extraterritorial service of process. This
    recommendation was approved by the Conference.

                   INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT

      H.R. 7421, 87th Congress, would amend the Interstate
    Commerce Act to make unlawful any discriminatory tax
    assessments against the property of a common carrier
    and would confer jurisdiction on the district courts to issue
                            22

injunctions in such cases. The Committee was of the view
that this is not a proper extension of the jurisdiction of (
the courts and recommended that the Conference inform
the Bureau of the Budget that it disapproves the bill. This
recommendation was approved by the Conference.

             RETIRED TERRITORIAL .T UDGES
   The Committee reported that it had given further con­
sideration to the proposal contained in S. 1897, 87th Con­
gress, to authorize retired judges of certain territorial
courts to perform judicial service, when designated and
assigned. In view of the transformation of Alaska and
Hawaii from Territories to States and the pending legis­
lation to give life tenure to the district judges in Puerto
Rico, the Committee concluded that the bill is no longer
of any significant importance and recommended that it
be dropped from the legislative program of the Judicial
Conference. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.

         BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   The Acting Chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy
Administration, Senior Judge Phillip Forman, presented
to the Conference a resolution with respect to the service
of Senior Judges Orie L. Phillips and John B. Sanborn
who have resigned from the Committee. The Conference
concurred unanimously in the resolution and directed that
it be transmitted to Judges Phillips and Sanborn.
        WHEREAS, the Judicial Conference at its September
     1942 Session authorized the Chief Justice of the
     United States to appoint a Committee to consider and
     report on matters of bankruptcy administration, and
        WHEREAS, pursuant to this authorization a stand­
     ing Bankruptcy Committee was created, and
        WHEREAS, the Honorable Orie L. Phillips and the
     Honorable John B. Sanborn were appointed by Chief
                                                          ()
                             23 


    Justice Harlan F. Stone as chairman and member re­
    spectively of that Committee, and
       WHEREAS, Judge Phillips and Judge Sanborn have
    served continuously as members of the Bankruptcy
    Committee even beyond their retirement from active
    duty and have displayed tireless energy as well as
    high legal skill in dealing with the solution of many
    difficult problems relating to bankruptcy, and
       WHEREAS, Judge Phillips and Judge Sanborn have
    unsparingly sacrificed their time and unusual abilities
    beyond the demands of all reasonable requirements,
    and
       \VHEREAS, Judge Phillips and Judge Sanborn
    through their efforts have contributed greatly to the
    improvement of the Bankruptcy Administration
    throughout the nation,
       RESOLVED, that we here record our sincere appre­
    ciation for their service to the Bankruptcy Commit­
    tee and to the improvement of Bankruptcy Adminis­
    tration, and that we here express our real affection
    for them accompanied by our feeling of deep personal
    debt for their able guidance and counsel. We wish
    for them an unalloyed enjoyment of all things that
    make life pleasant.

          SALARIES AND POSITIONS OF REFEREES

   The Conference was informed that the Committee had
met and considered the recommendations contained in the
report of the Director of the Administrative Office, dated
July 6, 1962, relating to the continuance of referee posi­
tions to become vacant prior to April 1, 1963 by expiration
of term, for changes in salaries of referees, changes in
arrangements, and the creation of new referee positions.
The Committee also considered the recommendations of
the district judges and the judicial councils of the circuits
concerned.
                             24

   The Conference considered fully the Committee's report
and the recommendations of the Director, judicial councils
and the district judges. On the basis of the report and rec­
ommendations, the Conference took the action shown in
the following table relating to changes in salaries and the
creation of new referee positions, and directed that unless
otherwise shown, this action become effective on October
1, 1962, or as soon thereafter as appropriated funds are
available:

                     ApPROPRIATIONS
   The Conference was informed that a supplemental ap­
propriation for referees' expenses for the fiscal year 1962
in the amount of $100,000 had been approved by both
Houses of Congress, but that funds for the salaries and
expenses of referees for the fiscal year 1963 had not yet
been appropriated. However, the report of the Committee
on Appropriations of the House of Representatives on the
fiscal year 1963 budget provides the sum of $2,600,000 for
salaries of referees, an increase of $230,000. This sum will
be sufficient to put into effect all salary increases and
changes previously approved by the Conference, includ­
ing those authorized above. The bill also includes the sum
of $4,850,000 for expenses of referees, an increase of
$640,000 over 1962.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
authorized the Director to seek adequate appropriations
for referees' salaries and expenses for the fiscal year 1964
and in addition such supplemental appropriations as may
become necessary for the fiscal year 1963.
          PENDING AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION
   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the following
bills, pending in the 87th Congress, and authorized the
Administrative Office to seek the introduction in the next
Congress of those bills which do not become law in the
present Congress.
   (1) Dischargeability oj Debts: H.R. 1742, 87th Con­
gress, would amend Section 2a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11
U.S.C. II(a), by adding at the end thereof a new subsec­
tion which would give to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction
to determine the discharge ability or nondischargeability
of provable debts.
   (2) Priority Claims, Statutory Liens and Title to
Property: H.R. 1961, 87th Congress, would amend Sec­
tions 1, 17a, 57j, 64a (5), 67b, and 70c of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U.S.C. 1, 35(a) 93(j), 104(a) (5), 107(b) and
                              30 


110 (c), relating to priority claims, statutory liens, and
title to property. While preserving the present position of
the costs of administration and wages in the distribution          (
of the assets of a bankrupt, the bill would enable valid
contractual liens such as chattel mortgages, conditional
sales contracts, trust receipts, and the like, to retain their
position ahead of statutory liens on personal property un~
accompanied by possession. The bill passed the House of
Representatives on August 7, 1961 with an amendment
approved by the Conference at its September 1961 session
 (Conf. Rept., p. 87).
   (3) Summa1'Y Jurisdiction: H.R. 4855, 87th Congress,
would amend Sections 60b, 67e, and 70e} of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U.S.C. 96(b), 107(e), and 110(e), to give the
bankruptcy court summary jurisdiction in actions involv~
ing preferences, liens and fraudulent transfers, and the
trustee's title to property.
    ( 4) Claims in Chapter XI Cases: H.R. 4856, 87th Con~
gress, would amend various Sections of the Bankruptcy
Act and add a new Section so as to require the filing of
claims in Chapter XI cases within the time prescribed by           (
Sect-ion 57n of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 93 (n). The
bill passed the House of Representatives on April 16, 1962.
   (5) Attorneys' Fees: H.R. 5149, 87th, Congress, would
amend Section 60d of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
96( d) to give the bankruptcy court authority on its own
motion to reexamine attorneys' fees to be paid in a bank~
ruptcy proceeding. The bill passed the House of Repre~
sentatives on April 16, 1962.
   (6) Referees' Retirement and Salary Bill: H.R. 5341,
87th Congress, would amend the Bankruptcy Act generally
to provide:
    (1)   Terms of 12 years for full-time referees.
    (2)   An increase in the maximum salary limitations for
           full-time and part-time referees and a provision that
           the salary of the Chief of the Bankruptcy Division
           of the Administrative Office shall not be less than
           the'maximum salary rate for a full-time referee.
                             31
    (3) Compensation for services of a retired referee.
    (4) 	 A more liberal retirement annuity and mandatory
           retirement for referees.
   A separate bill to provide compensation for the services
of a retired referee became law on September 19, 1962,
Public Law 87-677. This Act provides that the compensa­
tion of a retired referee shall be the same as the salary ap­
plicable to any full-time position he fills, or when assigned
to serve on a full-time basis in the territory of a part-time
referee, the minimum salary established by the Judicial
Conference for full-time referee service. Compensation
authorized under this Act is subject to the provisions of
Section 13 (b) of the Civil Service Retirement Act, 5 U.S.C.
2263. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference reaffirmed its approval of those provisions of H.R.
5341 not included in Public Law 87-677.
   (7) Omnibus Bill: H.R. 5393, 87th Congress-the so­
called noncontroversial omnibus bill-provides for several
clarifying, perfecting and conforming improvements in
the Bankruptcy Act. The bill became law on September 25,
1962, Public Law 87-681.
   (8) Rules oj Practice and Procedure: H.R. 7405, 87th
Congress, would provide for the promulgation of rules of
practice and procedure under the Bankruptcy Act by the
Supreme Court of the United States. The bill passed the
House of Representatives on August 7, 1961.
   (9) Deposit oj Bankruptcy Funds: H.R. 10204,
87th Congress, would authorize the deposit of funds of
bankrupt estates in interest bearing accounts under proper
safeguards. The bill passed the House of Representatives
on May 7, 1962.
                   OTHER LEGISLATION
  (1) Railroad Reorganizations: S.1624 and H.R. 7403,
87th Congress, would amend Section 77 of the Bankruptcy
Act, and S. 2733, 87th Congress, would" amend Section
20b of the Interstate Commerce Act, relating to the re­
organization of railroads. The Conference considered these
                              32 


bills fully and voted to approve the proposal to amend Sec­
tion 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. The Conference, however,           (
referred the proposal to amend Section 20b of the Inter­
state Commerce Act to the Bankruptcy Committee for
further study.
   (2) Claims in Chapter XIII Cases: S. 3307, 87th Con­
gress, would amend Section 606 ( 1) of the Bankruptcy Act,
11 U.S.C. 1006(1), to broaden the definition of "claims"
in Chapter XIII cases by striking from this subsection
the words "but shall not include claims secured by estates
in real property or chattels real." The Committee recom­
mended that the Conference disapprove the proposal con­
tained in the bill on the ground that the inclusion of claims
secured by estates in real property or chattels real in
proceedings under Chapter XIII would needlessly com­
plicate the administration of this procedure. This recom­
mendation was approved by the Conference.

              AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS
                                                                  (
   The Administrative Offi<:e had reported to the Commit­
tee that the audit of statistical reports of closed asset cases
has continued in accordance with the schedule approved
by the Conference in September 1961 (Conf. Rept., p.89).
It was the view of the Committee that the audit of statis­
tical reports of closed cases should be continued as a per­
manent part of the work of the Bankruptcy Division of
the Administrative Office.
   Judge Forman also reported that the subcommittee ap­
pointed to consider the question of the accountability of
referees, trustees and receivers with respect to errors in
the computation of the compensation of receivers and trus­
tees and the charges to be made for the Referees' Salary
and Expense Fund had recommended that receivers and
trustees should be held personally accountable for all over­
payments of commissions and compensation. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
                                   33 


proved the following resolution to carry out these
objectives:
   "Resolved, That the Administrative Office be authorized and directed
   to continue the policy of requiring referees to cause a thorough audit
   to be made of all accounts of receivers and trustees and to require
   strict compliance by them with all the provisions of the Bankruptcy
   Act relating thereto; that the Administrative Office continue its po:icy
   of auditing the statistical reports of closed cases; and that receivers
   and trustees shall be held personally accountable for any errors in the
   computation of receivers' and trustees' compensation."
   The question of the accountability of referees for errors
in the computation of charges for the Referees' Salary and
Expense Fund was referred to the Committee for further
study.
     DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE                OF   CHAPTER XIII
   The Administrative Office has reported to the Commit­
tee a continuing increase in the use of the provisions of
Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act, covering wage earner
plans for the payment of creditors. During the fiscal year
1962 there were 22,880 Chapter XIII cases filed, compared
with 19,723 in 1961. In the last year there were only six
districts in which no Chapter XIII cases were filed.
   The expanded use of Chapter XIII has created a number
of administrative problems, including the amount and
type of trustees' bonds; the charges and allowances to
trustees for compensation and expenses; the use of revolv­
ing funds to pay the salaries and expenses of trustees;
the cost of administering Chapter XIII cases; the use of
more than one Chapter XIII trustee in a district; the su­
pervision of the fiscal operations of the trustee; the audit
of trustees' accounts; and the records to be maintained
and the reports to be required from the trustees and ref­
erees. Accordingly, the Committee has directed that a
subcommittee be appointed to study and recommend guide
lines for all phases of the administration of Chapter XIII
cases.
                             34

        ANNUAL AND SICK LEAVE FOR REFEREES

  The Committee was advised by the Administrative Office       ('
that inquiry had been made as to whether referees in bank­
ruptcy are subject to the Annual Sick Leave Act and Reg­
ulations relating to Government employees. It was brought
to the attention of the Conference that the Comptroller
General of the United States has held that officers and em­
ployees whose hours of duty are not subject to a fixed
schedule are not subject to the leave system and that this
principle applies to judges of the federal courts. Upon rec­
ommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved
the principle that referees in bankruptcy, because of the
nature of their work schedules, are not subject to the
annual and sick leave laws.
                INCAPACITY OF REFEREES

  It was brought to the attention of the Committee that on
occasion full-time referees have become incapacitated,
due to accident or prolonged illness. In those instances
the referees have continued to receive their full compen­      (
sation and their duties have been performed by other ref­
erees in the district, or by referees assigned from other
districts in the circuit. It was the view of the Committee
that in cases of illness or accident, resulting in the pro­
longed absence of the referee, the Director of the Admin­
istrative Office should notify the district court and the
judicial council of the circuit concerned of the resulting
effect on the bankruptcy work in the district. This proce­
dure was approved by the Conference.

CHARGES FOR THE REFEREES' SALARY AND EXPENSE FUND

   The Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 18) authorized the Administrative Office to undertake
a study of the regulations under Section 40c(2) of the
Bankruptcy Act for the determination of "net proceeds
realized H and of payments into the Referees' Salary and
                             35 


Expense Fund as promulgated by the Conference in May
1947. The Bankruptcy Division, after study, concluded
that a change in these rules and regulations and a revision
of the percentage and special charges for the Referees'
Salary and Expense Fund are not required at this time.
The Committee recommended that this suggestion be ap­
proved with the understanding that the Bankruptcy Divi­
sion will continue to express its views upon inquiry from
referees and others as to the application of the regulations
and charges. The recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
   ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
   The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration
of the Criminal Law, Judge William F. Smith, presented
the report of the Committee.
          TIME SPENT BY DEFENDANTS IN
        CONFINEMENT PmOR TO SENTENCING
   H.R. 4846, 87th Congress, would amend 18 U.S.C.
3568 to provide that a person held in custody awaiting
trial because of his inability to post bail shall be allowed
credit for the time spent in custody prior to imposition of
sentence. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference approved the bill.
   Consideration is being given by the Committee to the
proposal to amend 18 U.S.C. 3568 to allow credit for time
spent in custody pending appeal ,vhere the reversal of
the defendant's conviction requires a new trial. The Com­
mittee has requested the views of the members of the Con­
ference as to the advisability of a further amendment of
the statute.
           ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES
  The Committee reported that no action has been taken
on S. 2879, 87th Congress, which would provide for the
appellate review of any sentence to a term of imprisonment
in excess of five years on the ground that the sentence,
                             36 


although within lawful limits, is excessive. The Commit­
tee is giving further consideration to this proposal.            (
                 INDIAN TRIBAL COURTS
   The Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept.,
p.23) deferred action on the proposal contained in S. 2612,
87th Congress, to provide for the appointment of Indian
tribal court judges by the judges of the district courts. The
Committee reported that the Department of Interior is
opposed to the legislation and that no Congressional action
is anticipated in the near future.
                 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
   H.R. 8140, 87th Congress, would revise and strengthen
the laws dealing with bribery, graft, and conflicts of in­
terest. The Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 20) disapproved the bill insofar as it applies to
part-time United States commissioners due to the impact
the conflicts of interest provisions may have on the ability
of the district courts to retain lawyers as part-time com-      (.'.
missioners. The Conference was advised that its views on
this bill had been communicated hy the Committee to the
Senate JUdiciary Committee.
              SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
  The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Person­
nel, Chief Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report
of the Committee to the Conference.
 FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE

   The Conference was informed that the Committee
desired to have a formal definition of its functions and re­
sponsibilities which would assist the Committee in deter­
mining matters properly and tend to lessen the possibility
of conflict with other Conference Committees. Upon recom­
mendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
following definition of its functions and responsibilities:
                                                                c
                            37 

  The Committee is responsible for initiating and review­
ing policies, programs, rules, regulations, procedures and
proposals for legislation, for presentation to the Judicial
Conference in the following areas:
     L 	 Classification of positions.
     2. 	 All types of compensation for all supporting
          personnel.
     3. 	 Recruitment, placement and conduct of support­
          ing personnel.
     4. 	 Personnel training and incentives for career
          serVIce.
     5. 	 Personnel health, safety. welfare and retirement
          programs.
     6. 	 Cooperation and coordination with other Com­
          mittees of the Conference where matters in the
          above areas involve functions and responsibilities
          of such other Committees.

                     COURT REPORTERS

     The Committee reported that a request had been re­
ceived from Chief Judge Hoffman of the Eastern District
of Virginia for additional court reporter assistance. While
sympathetic with the conditions existing in this district,
the Committee recommended that the request be disap­
proved pending the completion of a study by the Adminis­
trative Office on the advisability of altering the present
policy of providing one court reporter for each district
judge. The Committee's recommendation was approved
by the Conference.

          JUDICIAL EMPLOYEES TRAINING ACT

   The Conference at its September 1959 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 20) approved in principle legislation to provide
the Judiciary with the same authority given to the Execu­
tive Branch of the Government to train its supporting
personnel. The Committee presented a draft bill and recom­
                              38

mended that the Conference approve the bill, subject to
such minor revisions as may be found necessary to conform
to the technical changes desired by the Committees of Con­           (
                                                                         I
gress to which it may be referred. The recommendation
was approved by the Conference.                                          i
                    INCENTIVE AWARDS
  The Committee was authorized to undertake a study of
                                                                         I
the proposal to provide for an incentive awards program
for the supporting personnel of the Judiciary and to re­
port at a later session of the Conference.                               1
              CLERKS OF COURTS OF ApPEALS
      The Committee reported that requests had been re­
ceived for salary increases for the clerk and chief deputy
clerk of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit and for the clerk of the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. It has also been suggested to the Commit­
tee that consideration be given to suitable salary increases
for the clerk of each of the larger courts of appeals. After     (
full discussion, the Conference directed the Committees on
Court Administration and Supporting Personnel to con­
sider these requests further and report to a later session
of the Conference.
CLASSIFICATION OF PERSONNEL IN THE COURT OF ApPEALS
       FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
   The Conference at its September 1960 session approved
a salary plan for deputy clerks of the courts of appeals,
except the District of Colum bia, and directed the Adminis­
trative Office to survey the positions in that office and re­
port thereon to the Committee on Supporting PersonneL
As a result of its survey, the Administrative Office recom­
mended to the Committee that the supporting personnel
in the clerk's office of the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit be classified generally under the sal­
ary plan for deputy clerks of courts of appeals, but that
                                 39

    the Administrative Office be authorized to make exceptions
(   to the plan by providing additional appropriate grades for
    any positions which cannot properly be graded under the
    plan. The Committee was advised that the small number
    of positions involved did not justf~r the establishment of a
    separate plan for the District of Columbia Circuit. Upon
    recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
    proved the recommendation of the Administrative Office.
                          LAW CLERKS
       The Conference discussed the recommendation of the
    Committee that an additional salary grade be authorized
    for law clerks with five years experience as a law clerk
    with a Federal judge and directed that the matter be re­
    ferred to the Committee for further study.

                          SECRETARIES

       The Committee submitted the proposal of Chief Judge
    McGuire of the District of Columbia that secretaries to
    Federal judges be provided the same retirement benefits
    as are presently provided for members of Congressional
    staffs, 5 U.S.C. 2259 (b). The Conference, after full con­
    sideration, approved the proposal.

           DEPUTY CLERK FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

       The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
    tee, approved the request of Chief Judge Sobeloff for an
    additional deputy clerk for stenographic work in the
    United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
    subject, however, to the program of the Budget Committee.

      PERSONNEL IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

       The Committee reported that it had received a request
    from Chief Judge Zavatt of the Eastern District of New
    York to authorize additional personnel for the clerk's
    office in that district. It was the view of the Committee,
                             40

however, from all the information available, that the
clerk's office of the Eastern District of New York is amply    ,(
staffed. The Committee therefore recommended that the
Conference disapprove the request with the understand­
ing that the Administrative Office will make a further
study of the needs of the district and report to the Com­
mittee at its next meeting. This recommendation was ap­
proved by the Conference.

              PAY INCREASE LEGISLATION

  The Committee reported that it had been advised that
the inclusion of the supporting personnel of the Judiciary
in any pay increase legislation would be fully considered
by the Post Office and Civil Service Committees of the
Senate and House of Representatives.
                JUDICIAL STATISTICS
   The Chairman of the Committee on Judicial Statistics
Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, informed the Conference         (
that the Committee had reviewed with the Director and
members of the staff of the Administrative Office various
aspects of the statistical system for reporting the judicial
business of the courts.
   The Committee reported that the present system ap­
pears sound and that it will continue to be of assistance
in developing and analyzing the data compiled.
          DISPOSITION OF CIVIL CASES PENDING
                   OVER THREE YEARS

   The Conference at its September 1961 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 63) declared it to be the policy of the Judiciary
that every case pending three years or more, and appro­
priate for trial, be regarded as a judicial emergency by
all the judges of any circuit where such cases are to be
found and requested that each circuit, through its judicial
council, make appropriate plans for mustering the avail­
                                                               ()
                              41 


able judges of the circuit to pretry, try, and eliminate
these cases from the dockets by a date certain, fixed in
advance in each circuit with regard to the size of the task.
   It was the view of the Committee that this program has
had a salutary effect in many districts. Accordingly, the
Committee recommended that the Conference renew its
September 1961 resolution in regard to the disposition of
civil cases pending over three years. This recommendation
was approved by the Conference.

                   WEIGHTED CASELOAD

   The Chief of the Division of Procedural Studies and
Statistics had presented to the Committee a proposal for
a weighting system for civil and criminal cases, which is
designed to provide a more useful and comparative meas­
ure of workload among the individual district courts. The
weighting system is based on a series of time studies par­
ticipated in by a number of district judges in the last ten
years and a special study of time devoted to the trial of
cases in the last five years. Upon recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference authorized the publication of
the weighted caseload table of filings for the fiscal year
1962 in the annual report of the Director.

             CRIMINAL OFFENDER STATISTICS

   The Committee also considered a proposal by the Chief
of the Statistical Division to estahlish a center for the col­
lection of information concerning persons accused of crime
in the Federal courts, which would include a follow-up on
the record of each defendant convicted and sentenced. It
was the view of the Committee that a system for collecting
full information with reference to persons charged with
Federal crime will provide information useful in the ad­
ministration of justice, particularly in regard to sentenc­
ing. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference endorsed the proposal in principle, leaving
                             42 


the development of the details of such a system and its
administration for further study among the agencies con­
cerned with the problem.                                         (


           MOTIONS TO VACATE SENTENCE AND 

            PROCEEDINGS IN FORMA PAUPERIS 


   It was brought to the attention of the Committee that
the practice of docketing motions to vacate sentence under
28 U.S.C. 2255 is not uniform among the districts and
further that there is considerable variation in processing
these motions when they are filed in forma pauperis. In
many districts motions to vacate sentence are carried on
the criminal docket.
   It was the view of the Committee that motions to vacate
sentence are civil proceedings under the law and court
decisions and that these motions should therefore be dock­
eted on the civil docket of the court, in order that the rec­
ords of the court may be correct in terms of the statute and
in regard to the nature of judicial responsibility for these
matters. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the              (

Conference directed that the district courts be instructed
to docket all such motions on the civil dockets.
   In regard to applications accompanied by motions for
leave to proceed in forma pauperis, it was the view of the
Committee that there is value in having an official record
of such applications and that the hetter practice is to per­
mit the filing of the application and then to deny the mo­
tion where, on its face, it is without substance, rather than
to deny the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.
                     OTHER MATTERS
   The Conference was informed that the Committee had
approved the new classification system for civil and crim­
inal cases used in the annual report of the Director for
fiscal years 1961 and 1962, and that the Committee had
authorized the inclusion of an additional table, by district,
showing the cost per trial, per trial day, and per juror
                             43 


day of the operation of the petit jury system in the district
courts. The Committee has also suggested that cross ap­
peals be counted as separate cases in the statistical tables
concerning the business of the courts of appeals.
                 PRETRIAL PROGRAM
   The Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure,
Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, reported on the activities
of the Committee in the past year.

          SEMINARS FOR NEW DISTRICT JUDGES
   The Conference at its September 1961 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 102) requested the Committee to undertake a
seminar or series of seminars for newly appointed district
judges for the purpose of acquainting them with the prob­
lems of judicial administration arising in the operation of
the district courts. In accordance with this authorization,
the Committee this year planned and conducted three
regional seminars, attended in the aggregate by 90 re­
cently appointed district judges. Informative and illus­
trative material, together with copies of the remarks of
the experienced trial judges who served as discussion lead­
ers, were made available to the new district judges dur­
ing the course of the seminar proceedings.
     Statements by the participants indicate that the
seminars have been invaluable to the new district judges
and have achieved their purpose of acquainting them with
some of the problems involved in the operation of their
courts. On the basis of this experience, it was the view of
the Committee that the program should be continued. The
Conference thereupon authorized the Committee on Pre­
trial Procedure to conduct an annual seminar, commenc­
ing in 1963, for recently appointed district judges.
             CIRCUIT PRETRIAL COMMITTEES
  The Conference in September 1952 (Conf., Rept., p.
21) adopted a resolution requesting the chief judge of each
                             44 

circuit to appoint a regular standing committee of his cir­
cuit conference on pretrial procedure, consisting of at least
five members and to include both judges and lawyers,
which would be charged with the duty of
                                                                 r

      (a ) 	 Ascertaining the extent and the efficiency of
               the employment of pretrial procedure in the
               Federal and State courts of the circuit;
      (b) 	 Considering appropriate measures to promote
              its wider understanding and use and taking
               appropriate action; and
      (c) 	 Making an annual written report of its activi­
              ties and of the extent of the employment of
              pretrial in the circuit to the annual conference
               of the circuit and furnishing a copy to the
              chairman of the national committee.
   It has been brought to the attention of the Committee
that in several circuits the local pretrial committees have
not been functioning. Chief Judge Murrah advised the
Conference that the Committee would contact the chief
judges of the circuits concerning the reactivation of any        0

circuit pretrial committees that have become inactive.

        SUBCOMMITTEE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION

   The subcommittee of the Pretrial Committee appointed
to consider discovery problems arising in multiple litiga­
tion with common witnesses and exhibits has continued
to give its consideration to the problems presented by the
large volume of antitrust treble damage actions arising
out of the proceedings in the electrical equipment industry
in Philadelphia last year. The judges having the respon­
sibilty for the litigation have held two meetings this year
and have established an information center in the Federal
court building in Chicago to assist in compiling and dis­
seminating information on the progress of the litigation
in the various districts, including rulings made on prelim­
inary issues and on matters of discovery. A series of pre-

                                                                 c

                              45 

trial orders has been entered in almost every district, a
deposition program is underway, and the litigation is pro­
ceeding in an orderly manner. The subcommittee believes
that experience in the processing of this litigation will
provide precedents and guide lines for future litigation.
The development of general principles applicable to the
handling of discovery problems in multiple litigation will
therefore be considered further by the subcommittee in
the light of the methods developed in processing the cases
presently under consideration.

STATEMENT OF THE ESSENTIALS OF PRETRIAL PROCEDURE

   The special study of the Committee, aimed at the de­
velopment of a statement of the essentials of pretrial pro­
cedure and calendar control, was interrupted this year
by the seminars for new district judges and the special
study of discovery problems in multiple litigation. The
Committee, however, plans to proceed with the study and
anticipates that a draft of a statement on pretrial pro­
cedure will soon be available. The proceedings of the
Seminar on Procedures for Effective Judicial Adminis­
tration, held at the Southwestern Legal Center in July
1961 as a part of the Committee's special study, were
published in March and April 1962 in 29 F.R.D. 191 and
a reprint of the proceedings was made available to every
Federal judge.
               USE OF PRETRIAL PROCEDURE
   Reports received by the Committee indicate a continu­
ing increase in the use of the pretrial conference technique
among the district judges. Every Federal trial judge uses
pretrial, at least to some extent, and for the most part the
newly appointed district judges are enthusiastically em­
bracing the procedure.
   For the last three years the clerks of the courts have
classified pretrial conferences reported to the Adminis­
trative Office on the basis of those in which a pretrial order
                            46 


was entered (as required by Rule 16) and those in which
no order was entered. These figures indicate that pretrial
orders defining the issues and reciting agreements made      (
by the parties have been entered in about two-thirds of
the total pretrial conferences held. It is the view of the
Committee that more adequate statistical information con­
cerning pretrial procedure is desirable. Accordingly the
chairman of the Committee has been authorized to appoint
a subcommittee to explore this problem with the Commit­
tee on Judicial Statistics and with the Administrative
Office.

    INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
   The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Intercir­
cuit Assigments, Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported on
the processing of requests for intercircuit assignments.
   The Committee in accordance with Subdivision III (10)
of the plan for the assignment of judges, approved by the
Conference at its March 1960 session, had prepared and
distributed to the members of the Conference a statement (-,
relating to the need for intercircuit assistance and the
availability of judges for such service. Since its last report,
the Committee has recommended favorably on ten inter­
circuit assignments. No adverse recommendation has been
made. In one instance however, there was no subsequent
designation by the Chief Justice and no designation had
been made on the Committee's latest recommendation at
the time of its report.
   The judges receiving intercirclAit assignments during
this period include one circuit judge, three district judges,
one senior circuit judge and three senior district judges.
Since the filling of most of the new judgeship positions
created by the Act of May 19, 1961, the requests made to
the Committee have decreased in number, but in many
instances those which have been made were of a very
urgent nature. The Committee has been unable to satisfy
all the requests.
                               47 

   The Committee has observed that there is a desire among
the chief judges to communicate directly with other chief
judges rather than through the Committee, when help is
either needed or available. The Committee gave its as­
surance that it encourages such direct arrangements.
   The report of the Committee was received and approved
by the Conference.

        OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Operation of the
Jury System, Chief Judge Harry E. Watkins, submitted
the report of the Committee.

                   JURY COMMISSION BILL
   The Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 2) referred to the Committee for study certain amend­
ments proposed by the Department of Justice to the Jury
Commission Bill, H.R. 5391, 87th Congress, previously
approved by the Conference. The Committee reported that
it had made an extensive study of these proposals and had
conferred at length with representatives of the Depart­
ment of Justice. As a result of these conferences, the
Committee concurred in a number of desirable changes
recommended by the Department. Upon recommendation
of the Committee, the Conference thereupon approved the
following amended bill to provide for a jury commission
in each United States district court.
                            A BILL
To provide for a jury commission for each United States district
     court, to regulate its compensation, to prescribe its duties,
     and for other purposes.
     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section
1864 of title 28 of the United States Code is hereby amended to
read as follows:
"§1864..Jury commission: duties. compensation, and methods of
selecting and drawing jurors.
                                  48 


     "(a) Appointment. A jury commission shall be established
in each judicial district, consisting of the clerk of the court and
one or more jury commissioners, appointed by the district court.
                                                                          r·'
The jury commissioner shall be a citizen of the United States of
good character residing in the district of appointment who, at the
time of his appointment, shall not be a member of the same political
party as the clerk of the court or a duly qualified deputy clerk
acting for the clerk. If more than one jury commissioner is ap­
pointed, each may be designated to serve in one or more of the
places where court is held, and the clerk and the jury commissioner
so designated shall constitute the jury commission for that part of
the district. In the event that a jury commissioner is unable for
any reason to perform his duties, another jury commissioner may
be appointed, as provided herein, to act in his place until he is
able to resume his duties.
     "Jury commissioners shall be appointed to serve on a part­
time or full-time basis. If in the opinion of the court the efficient
operation of the jury system requires the services of a full-time
jury commissioner, the court may, with the approval of the Judicial
Conference of the United States, appoint one or more full-time
jury commissioners.
     "(b) Duties. In the performance of all its duties the jury
commission shall act under the direction and supervision of the
chief judge of the district.
     "The sources of the names and the methods to be used by
                                                                          o

the jury commission in selecting the names of persons who may
be called for grand or petit jury service shall be as directed by the
Chief Judge. The procedures employed by the jury commission
in selecting the names of qualified persons to be placed in the jury
box shall not systematically or deliberately exclude any group from
the jury panel on account of race, sex, political or religious affilia­
tion, or economic or social status. In determining whether persons
are qualified as jurors under section 1861 of this title, the jury
commission shall use questionnaires and such other means as the
chief judge may deem appropriate, including the administering
of oaths.
     "The names of jurors shall be publicly drawn by chance from
a jury box, wheel or similar device which contains at the com­
mencement of each drawing the names of not less than three
hundred qualified persons selected by the jury commission in
accordance with the provisions of this subsection.         .
     "The jury commission shall keep records of the names of
persons placed in the jury box, wheel or similar device, the ques­
                                                                          ,.

    are selected for jury service, the dates of service, and such other
(   appropriate records as the chief judge may direct, all for a period
    of not less than two years. With the approval of the chief judge,
    the jury commission may designate deputy clerks and other em­
    ployees in the office of the clerk of the court to assist the com­

    the opinion of the chief judge can be assigned to them.

    branch with comparable responsibilities.
          "Each jury commissioner shall receive his traveling and sub­

    by agreement or order of court is assigned to one particular judge

     SEC. 5. The provisions of this Act shall take effect ninety
days after the date of approval thereof, Provided, however, that
no grand or petit jury sworn prior to the effective date of this        ;(,
Act nor any person called or summoned for jury service, or whose
name is on a jury list or has been placed in a box, wheel, or similar
device, prior to that date, shall be ineligible to serve if the pro­
cedure by which the jury or the individual juror was selected,
called, summoned, or by which his name was listed or placed in a
box, wheel, or similar device, was in compliance with the law in
effect at the time of such action.

                           LEGISLATION

   The Committee reported that no action has been taken
on any of the following bills which had previously been
disapproved by the Conference:
     (1) 	 H.R. 818 and H.R. 1262, 87th Congress, to pro­
              vide that in a civil case the number of jurors
               required to constitute a jury, and the number
              of whom must agree for a valid verdict, shall
              be determined by the law of the State in which
              the action is tried.
     (2) 	 H.R. 189, 87th Congress, to require a juror to               (,
              take an oath that he does not advocate
              and is not a member of an organization that
              advocates the overthrow of the Government
              of the United States by force or violence.
   The Committee further reported that S. 1899, 87th Con­
gress, to increase the fees of jury commissioners in the
United States district courts from $5 to $10 per day, pre­
viously approved by the Conference, had passed the Senate
on August 2, 1961, but that no action has been taken on
a similar bill in the House of Representatives, H.R. 5392.
   There has been no action in Congress on S. 1660 and
H.R. 5616, 87th Congress, to increase the subsistence
and limit the mileage allowances of grand and petit jurors,
nor on the Jury Commission Bill, H.R. 5391.

                          HABEAS CORPUS
        Chief Judge Simon E. Sobeloff, in the absence of Senior
     Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
     Habeas Corpus, reported that the Committee had con­
     sidered S. 2888, 87th Congress, to add a new Section 2256
     to Title 28, United States Code, with regard to the issuance
     of a stay of execution or sentence. The new Section would
     provide as follows:
                  "§2256. Stay of execution or sentence

           "(a) A stay of execution or sentence in connection with any
       habeas corpus proceeding or other proceeding collaterally at­
       tacking any conviction of a person which has been affirmed by
       the highest court of any State shall be granted only by (1)
       the concurrent action of a majority of the circuit judges of a
       circuit who are in active service, or (2) the concurrent action
       of a majority of the justices of the United States who are in
       active service.
          " (b) A stay of execution or sentence in connection with
(:     any habeas corpus proceeding or other proceeding collaterally
       attacking any conviction of a person obtained in a district court
       and affirmed by the Supreme Court, or with respect to which
       the Supreme Court has denied certiorari, shall be granted only
       by (1) the judge who presided at the trial in which the convic­
       tion was obtained, or (2) the concurrent action of a majority
       of the circuit judges of a circuit who are in active service, or
        (3) the concurrent action of a majority of the justices of the
       United States who are in active service.
          " (c) Nothing contained in this section shall limit the power
       of any justice of the United States, or any circuit or district
       judge, to stay the execution of a sentence of death in connection
       with any habeas corpus proceeding if it appears that such
       sentence will be carried out before such proceeding can be dis­
       posed of, and that such stay is essential to a proper disposition
       of. such proceedings."
       It was the view of the Committee that there is no real
     need for the legislation. In most instances where an' ap­
     plication for stay is made to a United States court, the
     applicant is under sentence of death and the execution of
(
                            52 

the prisoner is imminent. That being so, the provisions of
subsections (a) and (b) would largely be nullified by the
provisions of subsection (c). Also, the requirement for
                                                              (r'
concurrent action by a majority of the judges of the
circuit, or a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court,
required by subsections (a) and (b), would impose an
unnecessary and undue burden on the members of these
courts without resulting in compensating advantages.
   The Committee pointed out that the proposed legislation
relating to habeas corpus actions brought by persons in
custody under judgment of a state court, approved by
the Conference in March 1959, was designed to cure al­
leged abuses in habeas corpus proceedings brought by
persons in custody under judgments of state courts. It was
the view of the Committee that if any legislation is to be
enacted, it ought to be the proposed legislation approved
by the Conference. The Committee suggested however
that in the absence of any manifested interest in Congress
for a revision of habeas corpus procedure, the Conference
proposal should not be pressed towards enactment. Upon (e)
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference disap­
proved S. 2888.
   On motion of Chief Judge William J. Lindberg, the
Conference referred to the Committee for study the ques­
tion of the need for a person, in custody pursuant to the
judgment of a state court, to file a petition for a writ of
certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States in
order to exhaust state remedies.

  CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER ADVISEMENT
   The Administrative Office submitted to the Conference
a report of cases under submission in the courts of appeals
and cases and motions under advisement in the district
courts. The report listed 58 cases under submission in the
courts of appeals more than six months as of September
1, 1962, and 36 cases and motions which had been held
under advisement by district judges more than six months
                                 53 


    as of that date. Where necessary, these will be brought to
    the attention of the judicial councils by the chief judges of
    the circuits.
                         LEGISLATION

      On motion of Chief Judge Biggs, the Conference au­
    thorized the Director of the Administrative Office to seek
    the introduction in the 88th Congress of any bills, spon­
    sored by the Conference, which are not enacted into law by
    the 87th Congress.

                          COMMITTEES
      On motion of Chief Judge Biggs, the Conference directed
    that the Advisory Committee, heretofore appointed by the
    Chief Justice, be continued.
           RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
      The Conference authorized the immediate release of its
(   action on matters considered at this session, where neces­
    sary for administrative action.
      For the Judicial Conference of the United States.
