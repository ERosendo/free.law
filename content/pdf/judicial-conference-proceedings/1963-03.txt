THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, 28 U.S.C. 331
   § 331. Judicial Conference of the United States.
   The Chief Justice of the United States shall summon annually the chief
judge of each judicial circuit, the chief judge of the Court of Claims, the
Chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and a district
judge from each judicial circuit to a conference at such time and place in
the United States as he may designate. He shall preside at such conference
which shall be known as the Judicial Conference of the United States. Special
sessions of the conference may be called by the Chief Justice at such times
 and places as he may designate.
   The district judge to be summoned from each judicial circuit shall be
chosen by the circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual judicial
conference of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 of this title and shall
serve as a member of the conference for three successive years, except that
in the year following the enactment of this amended section the judges in the
first, fourth, seventh, and tenth circuits shall choose a district judge to serve
for one year, the judges in the second, fifth, and eighth circuits shall choose a
district judge to serve for two years and the judges in the thh'd, sixth, ninth
and District of Columbia circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for
three years.
   If the chief judge of any circuit or the district judge chosen by the judges of
the circuit is unable to attend, the Chief Justice may summon any other
circuit or district judge from such circuit. If the chief judge of the Court of
Claims or the chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, is un­
able to attend the Chief Justice may summon an associate judge of such
court. Every judge summoned shall attend and, unless excused by the Chief
Justice, shall remain throughout the sessions of the conference and advise
as to the needs of his circuit or court and as to any matters in respect of
which the administration of justice in the courts of the United States may
be improved.
   The conference shall make a comprehensive suryey of the condition of
business in the courts of the United States and prepare plans for assignment
of judges to or from circuits or districts where necessary, and shall submit
suggestions to the various courts, in the interest of uniformity and expedition
of business.
   The Conference shall also carryon a continuous study of the operation and
effect of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as
prescribed by the Supreme Court for the other courts of the United States
pursuant to law. Such changes in and additions to those rules as the
Conference may deem desirable to promote simplicity in procedUre, fairness in
administration, the just determination of litigation, and the elimination of
unjustifiable expense and delay shall be recommended by the Conference from
time to time to the Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modi­
fication or rejection, in accordance with law.
   The Attorney General shall, upon request of the Chief Justice, report to
such conference on matters relating to the business of the several courts of
the United States, with particular reference to cases to which the United
States is a party.
   The Chief Justice shall submit to Congress an annual report of the pro­
ceedings of the Judicial Conference and its recommendations for legislation.
                                                                                     ()

       ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DEATH
            OF SENIOR JUDGE SOPER
  The Conference directed that the following statement
by Chief Judge Sobeloff concerning the death of Senior
Judge Morris A. Soper be included in the minutes of the
                                                                          I
Conference:
        I bring to the Conference the sad news that last night 

   Senior Judge Morris A. Soper died at his home in Baltimore 

   at the age of ninety years, after a short illness. 

        Judge Soper's judicial service spanned almost a half 

   century. It began in 1914 when he became Chief Judge of the 

                                                                   ( )

                                     3


          Supreme Bench of Baltimore City. He was appointed United
          States District Judge in 1923, and was elevated to the Court
(         of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, where he served for more
         than thirty years. For a time, while Judge Parker was in
          attendance at the Nuremberg trials, Judge Soper was the
          acting Chief Judge of the Circuit and a member of this
          Conference.
               Although Judge Soper took qualified retirement in 1955,
         he continued without interruption his activity as a judge of
         our Court, shouldering a full share of its burden. During'the
         manpower shortage we could not possibly have kept abreast
         of the docket without his steady help.
               Judge Soper was a man of extraordinary ability and
         indefatigable industry. His unflagging interest was the court
         and he devoted himself not only to the writing of opinions
         but was the source of wise and invaluable counsel in the
         administration of the court. His colleagues appreciated him
         as a warm friend and elder brother. The Judge endeared
         himself to a wide circle by his great wit and personal charm.
              To me personally the death of Judge Soper is a grievous
         loss, for our friendship began more than forty-five years ago
         when I, still a law student, became his law clerk. Through the
         intervening years I had the privilege of association with
(	       him in different capacities. I practiced before him in the
         District Court as United States Attorney and later as a
         member of the bar of the Court of Appeals. Although I be­
         came nominally his successor on the Court, actually by reason
         of his continued physical and mental health and vigor, I had
         the advantage of the constant guidance and help of a brilliant
         and experienced senior colleague. His undiminished activity
         endured till only a few weeks ago-a career rarely matched
         in American judicial history.

          REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
       Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, on invitation of
     the Chief Justice, spoke to the Conference informally on
     matters relating to the work of the Department of Justice.
     He informed the Conference that the caseload of Govern­
     ment litigation has increased over-all about fifteen per
     cent this year and that tax cases had increased more than
     thirty per cent. However, the disposition of cases, partic­
                            4


ularly land condemnation cases, has been expedited in
many courts and the number of open tracts in pending          (~
land condemnation cases has been reduced in the last year     . J
from 37,000 to 24,000.
   The Attorney General called attention to the problem
of the payment of the fees of commissioners appointed in
land condemnation cases and requested the Conference to
give further consideration to this problem. He also called
attention to the proposed Criminal Justice Act of 1963,
previously distributed to the members of the Conference.
This proposed Act would provide for the representation
of indigent criminal defendants in the federal court system
in somewhat the same manner as legislation previously
recommended by the Conference. The Attorney General
requested that the proposed legislation be considered by
the Conference.
         SURVEY OF JUDICIAL BUSINESS
   The Conference received reports from the Chief Judge
of the Court of Claims, the Chief Judge of the Court of ()
Customs and Patent Appeals, and from the Chief Judges
of the respective circuits concerning the state of the dockets
in their courts and circuits. These reports were supple­
mented by the district judges who presented additional
details concerning the business of the district courts of
the circuits. The Conference was informed that in accord­
ance with the plan and policy adopted by the Conference in
September 1961 and renewed at its session in September
1962, progress had been made in the disposition of civil
actions pending more than three years. Many district
courts are completely current in the disposition of these
cases.
             COURT ADMINISTRATION
   The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administra­
tion, Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the report
of the Committee.
                                                              (J

                  GEOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION 

(      Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the
    Subcommittee on the Geographical Organization of the
    Courts had met with Mr. William R. Foley, General
    Counsel for the Judiciary Committee of the House of
    Representatives, and with representatives of the Columbia
    University Project for Effective Justice last November.
    Preliminary plans for a complete study and an historical
    analysis concerning the residences of parties and the places
    where causes of action arose have been discussed. At the
    request of Judge Biggs, the Committee was granted leave
    to consider the matter further and to report to a later ses­
    sion of the Conference.

             CONSOLIDATION OF JUDICIAL DISTRICTS
                     IN SOUTH CAROLINA

       The Conference was informed that the Judicial Council
    of the Fourth Circuit had recommended the consolidation
    of the Eastern and Western Districts of South Carolina,
(   including the elimination of certain places of holding court.
    The Conference was also informed that in the proposed
    consolidation an employee of the district court in one dis­
    trict who is related to a district judge in the other district
    would be exempted from the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 458.
    After a full discussion of the proposal, the Conference
    voted to approve the consolidation in principle with the
    understanding that the employee who is related to a judge
    will continue to serve the court in a different area of the
    state and will not work on the same matters as the judge
    to whom he is related. Chief Judge Biggs was authorized
    to prepare a draft bill for introduction in the Congress.

        DIVISIONS IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS

      S. 721 and H.R. 2538, 88th Congress, would transfer
    the Counties of Austin, Fort Bend and Wharton from the
    Galveston Division to the Houston Division of the Southern
                             6

District of Texas. Upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, the Conference approved the bills.                         t   ,
                                                                I )

          JUDICIAL SURVIVORS' ANNUITY FUND
   The Committee had been requested by the Chief Justice
to review the Judicial Survivors' Annuity System in the
light of the actuarial evaluation of the system prepared by
Mr. Bertram Oppel of the Office of the Actuary, Social
Security Administration. The study indicated that the
Judicial Survivors' Annuity System is insufficiently
funded, as is the Civil Service Retirement System. The
problem was discussed at length by the Conference, and the
Committee was authorized to consider the entire matter
further and to report at a future session of the Conference.

              DIVISION OF CLERKS' OFFICES

   The Federal Court Clerks Association had recommended
the establishment in the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts of a separate division dealing ex-        i'
clusively with the administration of offices of clerks of \ )
court. The Committee had considered the proposal at length
and had concluded that the establishment of such an office
would have little value to the clerks in the administration
of their offices, that the duties of the clerks are of very
wide range and are covered by a number of existing divi­
sions of the Administrative Office, and that the creation
of a new division within the Administrative Office would
create serious personnel problems. Upon recommendation
of the Committee, the Conference disapproved the proposal.
                      CLERKS' FEES

   The Conference in March 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 6) had
directed the Administrative Office to undertake a study
of the existing fee schedules for clerks of court and to re­
port any suggested changes in fees to the Committee. How­
ever, due to the pressure of business and lack of personnel,
                                                               () 

                                 7


    the Administrative Office has not completed these studies.
    The Committee was thereupon granted leave to consider
    the matter further and report at the next session of the
    Conference.
                   SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES
       The Conference at its September 1962 session (Conf.
    Rept., p. 16) had directed the Committee to consider fur­
    ther the proposal contained in S. 1268, 87th Congress, re­
    lating to (1) the selection of chief judges of the circuits
    and of multiple-judge district courts; (2) the terms of
    service of chief judges; and (3) the powers and responsi­
    bilities of chief judges with respect to the general admin­
    istrative superintendence of the business of the circuit
    and district courts. The Committee reported that the pro­
    posal contained in S. 1268 has not been introduced in the
    88th Congress, and that the Committee has formulated
    no recommendation concerning the bill. The Committee
    was accordingly granted leave to consider the matter fur­
(   ther and to report at a later session of the Conference.
              DISBURSEMENT OF JUDICIARY FUNDS
       The Department of Justice has proposed that the clerks
    of the courts of appeals and district courts, subject to
    regulations prescribed by the Director of the Administra­
    tive Office, shall disburse appropriated funds for the main­
    tenance and operation of the courts rather than United
    States marshals. The Committee had previously reported
    that it endorses the plan in principle but that it had been
    unable to ascertain the cost to the judiciary of assuming
    this function. The Committee has now been informed by
    the Director that serious consideration is being given to
    the introduction of computers in the Administrative Office
    which could take care of all the disbursing functions for
    the entire judicial system. The Committee, therefore, re­
    quested and was granted leave to consider the matter
    further.

                   PRETRIAL EXAMINERS
   In accordance with the direction of the Conference in
September 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 18) the Administrative
Office prepared for the Committee a report and a statistical
analysis of the operation of the pretrial examiner systems
in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia and the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. Thereafter, the Institute
of Judicial Administration, upon request of the Committee,
made an independent survey of the pretrial examiner sys­
tems, but the report was not received in time for consid­
eration by the Committee. Upon recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference directed that the matter be
referred to both the Committees on Pretrial Procedure
and Court Administration for consideration and report at
the next session of the Conference. The Conference further
directed that copies of the report of the Institute of Judi­
cial Administration, together with any written comments
by Chief Judge McGuire or Chief Judge Ryan, be circu­           "",

lated to all members of the Conference and to the chief (        )
judges of the large multiple-judge district courts.
        DISQUALIFICATION FOR BIAS OR PREJUDICE
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, reaffirmed its approval of the proposal contained in
H.R. 3008, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 144 with
respect to the disqualification of a judge for bias or preju­
dice. The bill is identical with S. 2478 and H.R. 10776,
87th Congress, which contained the proposal approved by
the Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept.,
p.7)
   The Conference specifically disapproved H.R. 3325, 88th
Congress, which would also amend 28 U.S.C. 144.
          ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS AND DIVISIONS
  H.R. 311, 88th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 85 and
133, to divide the State of Colorado into two judicial dis­
                                                                )
                                  9


    tricts. It was the view of the Committee that the bill would
    make no contribution to the efficient working of the judi­
    cial system, and the Conference thereupon disapproved
    H.R. 311, or any similar bill.
       H.R. 51, 88th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 90 to
    provide a new division in the Northern District of Georgia
    and establish Griffin as an additional place of holding court
    in the new division. The bill would also waive the provisions
    of 28 U.S.C. 142 in regard to the furnishing of quarters
    and accommodations for the court at Griffin. Upon recom­
    mendation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved
    the bill.

         REPRESENTATION OF DISTRICT JUDGES ON THE
             JUDICIAL COUNCILS OF THE CIRCUITS

       S. 979 and H.R. 2841, 88th Congress, would amend 28
    U.S.C. 332 to provide for the inclusion of district judges
    or a district judge on the Judicial Council of each circuit.
    These bills are identical with S. 1933 and H.R. 6690, 87th
(   Congress, previously approved by the Conference. The
    recommendation of the Committee that the Conference
    reaffirm its approval of the proposal contained in these
    bills was not approved by the Conference.

              RETIREMENT OF TERRITORIAL JUDGES

       S. 272, 88th Congress, would provide that the amend­
    ment to 28 U.S.C. 373, made by Section 5 of the Act of
    February 10, 1954, 69 Stat. 13, should apply to any judge
    of the United States District Court for the District of
    Hawaii who retired under Section 373 before February 10,
    1954, as if such amendment had been in effect on the date
    of retirement of the judge. The bill is identical with H.R.
    1782, 87th Congress, which was disapproved by the Con­
    ference in March 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 6). Upon recom~
    mendation of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its
    disapproval of the proposal contained in this bill.

              ELECTRONIC SOUND RECORDINGS
   The Conference had previously directed the Committee
to draft and seek a clarifying amendment to 28 U.S.C.
753 (b) to authorize court reporters to file electronic sound
recordings of proceedings on arraignment, plea and sen­
tences in criminal cases, in lieu of transcripts as presently
required. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference approved the following proposal to amend the
first three paragraphs of 28 U.S.C. 753 (b) :
         One of the reporters appointed for each such court shall
   attend at each session of the court and at every other proceed­
   ing designated by rule or order of the court or by one of the
   judges, and shall record verbatim by shorthand, by mechan­
   ical means or by electronic sound recording subject to regula­
   tions promulgated by the JUdicial Conference: (1) all
   proceedings in criminal cases had in open court; (2) all
   proceedings in other cases had in open court unless the
   parties with the approval of the judge shall agree specifically
   to the contrary; and (3) such other proceedings as a judge of
   the court may direct or as may be required by rule or order
   of court or as may be requested by any party to the proceed-         ()
   ing. The Judicial Conference may prescribe the types of
   mechanical and electronic sound recording means which shall
   be used by the reporters for recording court proceedings.
         The reporter shall attach his official certificate to the
   original shorthand notes or other original records so taken
   and promptly file them with the clerk who shall preserve
   them in the public records of the court for not less than ten
   years.
         Upon the request of any party to any proceeding which
   has been so recorded who has agreed to pay the fee therefor,
   or of a judge of the court, the reporter shall promptly tran­
   scribe the original records or the requested parts of the
   proceedings and attach to the transcript his official certificate,
   and deliver the same to the party or judge making the
   request. He shall also transcribe and certify all arraignments,
   pleas, and proceedings in connection with the imposition of
   sentence in criminal cases unless they have been recorded by
   electronic sound recording as provided in this subsection and
   the original records so taken have been certified by him and
   filed with the clerk as hereinabove provided in this subsection.
                                  11 


        He shall also transcribe and certify such other parts of the
        record of proceedings as may be required by rule or order
(       of court.
                 COURT REPORTERS' TRANSCRIPTS
       The Conference in September 1961 (Conf. Rept., p. 100)
    had approved an amendment to 28 U.S.C. 753(f) to au~
    thorize the payment by the United States of the cost of a
    transcript for an indigent person in a proceeding to vacate
    sentence brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255. The Chairmen
    of the Committees on Court Administration and the Ad~
    ministration of the Criminal Law were authorized to
    cooperate in presenting to Congress this recommendation
    and the recommendation to amend 28 U.S.C. 753 (b).
       A proposal to increase the court reporter's fee for the
    use of a transcript in the preparation or perfection of an
    appeal from twenty~five cents to thirty cents per page,
    which was referred to the Committees on Court Admin~
    istration and Supporting Personnel for study at the pre~
    vious session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1962,
(   p. 15), was postponed to the next session of the Conference.
        PAYMENT OF COURT REPORTERS WHO FAIL TO FILE 

             TRANSCRIPTS OF PLEAS AND SENTENCING 

               PROCEEDINGS IN CRIMINAL CASES AS 

                 REQUIRED BY 28 U.S.C. 753(b) 

       The Director of the Administrative Office had previously
    requested instructions from the Conference with respect
    to paying court reporters who failed to file transcripts of
    pleas and sentences in criminal cases as required by 28
    U.S.C. 753 (b). (See Conf. Rept., Sept. 1961, p. 70). The
    Director, at that time, was authorized to continue salary
    payments to the court reporters, but was directed to in~
    struct all court reporters that hereafter they must either
    file a complete transcript of all proceedings in connection
    with arraignment, pleas, and imposition of sentence in
    criminal cases, or file an adequately authenticated elec~
    tronic sound recording of such proceedings, and that they
                                                                       i
                                                                       I
                               12

should certify to the Director of the Administrative Office
quarterly or at such other suitable intervals as might be ()
fixed by him, that in all such proceedings heard within
the quarterly or other period ended six months prior to
the certificate either a transcript or an adequately certified
electronic sound recording had been filed with the clerk.
   The Committees on Court Administration and Support~
ing Personnel reported that many court reporters have
failed to comply with the regulations set forth in Adminis~
trative Office Bulletin No. 255, dated January 9, 1962.
Upon recommendation of the Committees, the Conference
resolved
         That the Director is authorized and directed to withhold
    the payment of salaries of court reporters who have not tran­
    scribed and filed arraignments, pleas, and sentences in crim­
    inal cases as required by Section 753 (b), or have not filed
    electronic sound recordings of arraignments, pleas, and sen­
    tences in criminal cases as provided in Administrative Office
    Bulletin No. 255, by September 30, 1963, and in due course
    thereafter.

                  PRECEDENCE OF JUDGES
                                                                    ()
   There had been referred to the Committee on Court
Administration the request of Chief Judge Lumbard of
the Second Circuit for an expression of views by the Con­
ference as to the precedence of judges in the situation
where the permanent commission of a judge is dated prior
to the permanent commission of another judge but post­
dates the recess appointment of that judge. It was the view
of the Committee that when a permanent commission is
issued after a recess appointment, the permanent commis­
sion supersedes the recess appointment. The Conference,
after full consideration of the report of the Committee,
adopted the following resolution:
         Resolved that in the opinion of the Judicial Conference
    the precedence of judges of the United States under sections
    45(b), 136(b), 172, 212 and 253 of title 28 of the United
    States Code should be determined by reference to the dates of

                                                                    ()
                                    13
         the respective commissions, whether recess or permanent,
         under which the judges concerned are actually serving at the
         time as of which the question of precedence arises, or if such
         commissions bear the same date by reference to the respective
         ages of the judges concerned.
             Accordingly the date of a recess commission ceases to
         have significance for purposes of precedence after the judge
         named therein has received his permanent commission and
         has begun service thereunder.

                    REVISION OF THE LAWS
       Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Com­
     mittee on Revision of the Laws, submitted the report of
     the Committee.
                         REMOVAL JURISDICTION
        The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
     tee, approved an amendment to 28 U.S.C. 1446 (b) to in­
     crease from 20 to 30 days the period of time authorized
     for filing a petition for removal after receipt by the defend­
(	   ant of a copy of the complaint or after service of summons,
     and directed that a bill to accomplish the amendment be
     transmitted to the Congress.
             JUDICIAL REFERRALS TO THE INTERSTATE
                    COMMERCE COMMISSION
        The Department of Justice had requested the views of
     the Conference on a proposal to amend 28 U.S.C. 1336 and
     1398 with respect to cases referred to the Interstate
     Commerce Commission by district courts or the Court of
     Claims, to establish jurisdiction and venue in appeals
     from the Commission's orders in such cases in the courts
     of referral, and to establish a limitation of 30 days within
     which appeals can be taken from rulings by the Commis­
     sion in reference cases. It was the view of the Committee
     that the proposal is a proper one to meet a procedural dif­
     ficulty which needs correction. Upon recommendation of
     the Committee, the Conference approved the proposal.

        SEIZURE OF AMERICAN PROPERTY ABROAD

   The Committee on the Judiciary of the United States          ()
Senate had requested the views of the Conference on S.
576, 88th Congress, to amend Title 28 U.S.C., to provide
means of redress for unlawful seizure of American prop~
erty by foreign governments. The bill would authorize the
district courts to adjudicate actions involving, or arising
out of, acts of foreign states in violation of general prin~
ciples of international law, or of a treaty, even though the
action is brought against a foreign state without its con­
sent or involves the validity of official acts of the foreign
state. It was the view of the Committee that the bill in­
volves problems of international law and treaty rights
which directly affect the foreign relations of the United
States and which are primarily questions of public policy.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
directed that the Committee on the Judiciary of the United
States Senate be informed that the Conference expresses
no opinion on the proposal contained in the bill.
                                                                ()
                DIRECT ACTION STATUTES

   S. 103 and H.R. 1997, 88th Congress, would amend 28
U.S.C. 1332, to eliminate from the diversity jurisdiction
of the district courts suits on tort claims in which the
plaintiff and alleged tortfeasor are local residents, but
which under a state "direct action" statute may be brought
directly against a foreign insurance carrier without join­
ing the local tortfeasor as a defendant. It was the view of
the Committee that while these "direct action" cases are
within the letter of the diversity jurisdiction, they are
not within its spirit or intent and should be eliminated
from the heavy caseloads in the districts to which the
"direct action" statutes apply. The bill would have its
principal effect on litigation in the district courts in
Louisiana and Wisconsin. Upon recommendation of the
Committees on Court Administration and Revision of the
                                                                ()

    Laws, the Conference approved H.R. 1997, 88th Congress,
    which is the preferred draft.

           COMMISSION AND ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON
         INTERNATIONAL RULES OF JUDICIAL PROCEDURE

       The Bureau of the Budget had requested the views of
    the Conference on a draft bill to improve judicial pro­
    cedures for serving documents, obtaining evidence and
    proving documents in litigation with international aspects,
    which had been prepared and submitted to the President
    by the Commission and Advisory Committee on Interna­
    tional Rules of Judicial Procedure, appointed pursuant
    to the Act of September 2, 1958, Public Law 85-906. The
    purposes of the proposal are to improve United States
    judicial procedures for (1) serving documents abroad in
    aid of actions pending in the United States, (2) serving
    documents in the United States in connection with pro­
    ceedings before foreign and international tribunals, (3)
    obtaining evidence abroad in connection with proceedings
(   in the United States, (4) obtaining evidence in the United
    States in connection with proc~edings before foreign and
    international tribunals, (5) proving foreign official docu­
    ments, (6) subpoenaing witnesses in foreign countries,
    and (7) transmitting letters rogatory between the United
    States and foreign and international tribunals. The
    proposed legislation supplements the Commission's recom­
    mendations for amendments to the Rules of Civil
    Procedure, which were considered by the Conference
    Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and in­
    corporated in amended Rules 4 and 28 of the Federal Rules
    of Civil Procedure, adopted by the Supreme Court on
    January 21, 1963.
       Judge Maris stated that the Committee is in agreement
    that the draft bill will effect important improvements in
    the procedure applicable to litigation having international
    aspects in situations in which at present the procedure is
                            16

inadequate and unrealistic in the light of the laws and pro­
cedure of many foreign countries. The bill would imple-        ()
ment in this regard reforms in that procedure which have
already been in part adopted by the Supreme Court. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
proved the bill and directed that the Bureau of the Budget
be so informed.
                   OTHER LEGISLATION
   The Conference, on the joint recommendation of the
Committees on Court Administration and Revision of the
Laws, gave its specific approval, to the extent indicated,
to the following bills pending in the 88th Congress, which
would carry out proposals approved, in whole or in part,
at previous sessions by the Conference.
   (a) H.R. 697, 88th Congress, to extend the provisions
of 28 U.S.C. 1963, for the registration of judgments to
the district courts of the Virgin Islands, Guam and the
Canal Zone and to provide for the registration of that
portion of divorce decrees providing for the payment of (-')
money or the transfer of property. (Conf. Rept., Mar.
1961, p. 18).
   (b) H.R. 700, 88th Congress, to provide for the publica­
tion before entry of decrees, judgments, and orders entered
by consent upon the merits of civil antitrust proceedings
in the district courts and in proceedings by any board or
commission for the enforcement of any provision of the
Clayton Act or the Federal Trade Commission Act. (Conf.
Rept., Sept. 1961, p. 76).
   (c) H.R. 2832, 88th Congress, to withdraw from the
district courts jurisdiction of suits brought by fiduciaries
who have been appointed for the purpose of creating diver­
sity of citizenship between the parties. This bill embodies
a proposal made by the Conference in September 1959
 (Conf. Rept., p. 8).
   (d) H.R. 2835, 88th Congress, to clarify the status of
circuit and district judges retired from regular active
                                                               ()
                                 17 

    service. The bill embodies a proposal made by the Confer­
    ence in September 1959 (Conf. Rept., p. 9).
       (e) S. 299 and H.R. 2985, 88th Congress, to amend
    28 U.S.C. 1391, to permit an action on a tort claim to be
    brought in the judicial district in which the act or omis­
    sion complained of occurred. (Conf. Rept., March 1961,
    p. 19).
       (f) H.R. 2840, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C.
    1391(a) and (b) to authorize a civil action to be brought
    in the district in which the claim arose, as well as in the
    district of the residence of a party. The proposal contained
    in the bill would apply to every civil action and is not
    limited to tort cases. It is thus broader in scope than the
    proposal contained in S. 299 and H.R. 2985, 88th Congress,
    above recommended. H.R. 2840 is preferred by the Con­
    ference and, if enacted, would render unnecessary the
    enactment of S. 299 and H.R. 2985.
       (g) H.R. 2844, 88th Congress, to provide life tenure
    for judges hereafter appointed to the United States Dis­
(
    trict Court for the District of Puerto Rico. (Conf. Rept.,
    Sept. 1961, p. 77).
       (h) H.R. 2845, 88th Congress, to provide that the
    district courts shall always be open for certain purposes,
    to abolish terms of court and to regulate the sessions of
    the courts for transacting judicial business. (Conf. Rept.,
    Sept. 1961,p. 76).
       (i) H.R. 2846, 88th Congress, to amend the Judicial
    Survivors' Annuity Act to bring it into conformity with
    the provisions of the revised Civil Service Retirement Act
    with respect to annuities for survivors of Members of
    Congress. The bill embodies a proposal made by the Con­
    ference in March 1960 (Conf. Rept., p. 36).
       (j) H.R. 2859, 88th Congress, to provide for the pro­
    mulgation of rules of practice and procedure under the
    Bankruptcy Act. (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1961, p. 88).
                            18 


                ADMISSIONS TO THE BAR 


   H.R. 698, 88th Congress, would amend Title 28 U.S.C.,
with respect to the eligibility of members of the Bar of
                                                               n
the Supreme Court of the United States to practice before
all courts of appeals and district courts. The proposal
would deprive the lower courts of all control over the ad­
mission to their bars of lawyers who had been previously
admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court. The bill is
identical with H.R. 842 and H.R. 1260, 87th Congress,
disapproved by the Conference in March 1961 (Conf.
Rept., p. 22). The Conference reaffirmed its disapproval
of the proposal contained in this bill.

             COURT OF VETERANS' ApPEALS

   H.R. 932, H.R. 1806, H.R. 2162 and H.R. 3531, 88th
Congress, would establish a Court of Veterans' Appeals and
prescribe its jurisdiction and functions. The Conference
was of the view that the question whether judicial review
of the denial of veterans' claims should be accorded is a
matter of public policy which is solely within the province
                                                               ()
of Congress to decide and that the judiciary should take
no position thereon. If, however, Congress should decide to
grant such review, the Conference believed that review by
a Court of Veterans' Appeals, with local hearings by com­
missioners of the court, would provide a more suitable form
of review than by the district courts, the courts of appeals
or the Court of Claims. Accordingly, the Conference ap­
proved the type of review proposed by H.R. 932, H.R. 1806,
H.R. 2162 and H.R. 3531, 88th Congress, except as to the
provisions of H.R. 932 and H.R. 1806 which would amend
28 U.S.C. 451 and 610 to include the proposed court among
the courts of the United States and which would have re­
quired the Director of the Administrative Office to assume
certain responsibility for its administrative affairs. These
latter provisions were specifically disapproved by the
Conference.
                                 19 


       H.R. 538, 88th Congress, would confer jurisdiction upon
    the Court of Claims to review de novo claims for benefits
    and payments under laws administered by the Veterans'
    Administration and H.R. 148, H.R. 2911, H.R. 2354, H.R.
    2695, 88th Congress, would permit judicial review of com­
    pensation and pension claims by the district courts. The
    Conference disapproved the types of review proposed by
    these bills, since they are inconsistent with review by a
    Court of Veterans' Appeals, as above proposed, and would
    impose an unwarranted burden of work upon these courts.

              RETIREMENT OF TERRITORIAL JUDGES
       The Conference in March 1960 (Conf. Rept., p. 38), had
    approved a proposal to reduce from 10 to 8 years the length
    of judicial service required of a territorial judge in order
    to entitle him to receive a retirement pension. Upon recom­
    mendation of the Committees on Court Administration and
    Revision of the Laws, the Conference reaffirmed its ap­
    proval of this proposal and directed that a bill to amend
c   28 U.S.C. 373 be prepared and submitted to the Congress.

         RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
       Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the stand­
    ing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, pre­
    sented to the Conference the recommendations of the Com­
    mittee and a report on the activities of the standing and
    advisory Committees on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
    He informed the Conference that Mr. Will Shafroth, Dep­
    uty Director of the Administrative Office, had been ap­
    pointed Secretary of the standing Committee, and ex
    officio Secretary of the Advisory Committees, succeeding
    Mr. Aubrey Gasque, who resigned. The Committee has
    adopted a resolution expressing its gratitude for the excel­
    lent service Mr. Gasque had rendered for and with the
    Committee as its Secretary in the improvement of federal
    judicial procedure.

      SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON RULES OF EVIDENCE
   The Special Committee appointed to consider the fea-       ()
sibility and desirability of formulating uniform rules of
evidence for the federal courts had presented to the stand­
ing Committee its final report stating the view of the
Special Committee that" it is feasible and desirable to
formulate uniform rules of evidence to be adopted by the
Supreme Court for the United States District Courts."
The standing Committee accordingly recommended that
an advisory committee on rules of evidence be appointed
by the Chief Justice, consisting of approximately 15 mem­
bers broadly representative of all segments of the profes­
sion, with special emphasis on trial lawyers and trial
judges, and that a reporter, or reporters, to the advisory
committee be appointed by the Chief Justice. The Com­
mittee suggested, however, that the appointment of the
advisory committee and reporter be deferred until after
the Supreme Court has indicated informally its approval of
proceeding with the project. The recommendations of the
Committee were approved by the Conference, and the            ()
special Committee on Evidence, at its request, was dis­
charged with the appreciation of the Conference for the
splendid service performed.
       ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL RULES
   Judge Maris reported that the Advisory Committee on
Criminal Rules had given tentative approval to amend­
ments to various rules of criminal procedure and that,
with the approval of the standing Committee, these amend­
ments were printed and circulated widely. The bench and
bar of the country have been requested to submit their
comments and suggestions concerning these proposed
amendments to the standing Committee not later than
December 31, 1963. Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee
is proceeding with its study of the remaining rules of
criminal procedure and hopes to have its recommendations

                                                              (J
                                     21 


        with respect to those rules formulated within the coming
        year.
              ADVISORY COMMITTEES ON CIVIL, ADMIRALTY,
                 BANKRUPTCY, AND ApPELLATE RULES

           The Advisory Committees on Civil, Admiralty, Bank­
        ruptcy and Appellate Rules are giving active consideration
        to the study and formulation of amendments to the rules
        of procedure within their jurisdiction and each Committee
        has held a meeting since the last session of the Conference.
        The Advisory Committees on Civil and Admiralty Rules
        and their reporters are working closely together on the
        program of unifying the civil and admiralty rules and
        substantial progress is being made. The Committees expect
        to be able to agree on the amendments to the civil rules that
        are necessary for this purpose. None of the Committees,
        however, has at this time formulated definitive amend­
        ments for submission to the bench and bar.

    (       AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
           The Committee recommended to the Conference that
        the amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
        adopted by the Supreme Court on January 21,1963, should
        be made effective on July 1, 1963, the beginning of the next
        fiscal year, so as· to facilitate the change in the clerks'
        offices to new procedures which the amendments require
        and so as to give more ample opportunity for the bench
I
        and bar to familiarize themselves with those procedures.
        This recommendation was approved by the Conference.

                    JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
          The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief
        Judge William J. Campbell, reported that hearings before
        the Appropriations Subcommittee of the House of Rep­
        resentatives on the appropriation requests for the fiscal
        year 1964 had been held on January 28, 1963, but that a
    (
                                22 


report from the Appropriations Committee was not ex­
pected for some time. With respect to the current fiscal              \
                                                                          /,)
year 1963, the appropriations appear adequate, although
it has been necessary to request supplemental funds to
cover increased costs under the Salary Reform Act of
1962 and to purchase West's Modern Federal Practice
Digest.
   The Conference was informed that the Department of
Justice had not included in its appropriation estimates for
the fiscal year 1964 funds for the payment of land commis­
sioners appointed under Rule 71 A (h) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. It was pointed out that if the Depart­
ment of Justice does not request the necessary funds, no
payments to land commissioners can be authorized beyond
June 30, 1963. The Conference thereupon adopted the fol­
lowing resolution reaffirming its action at the March 1962
session:
         Be it resolved, That the Judicial Conference of the United
    States requests the Attorney General to include in the 1964
    budget estimates for the Department of Justice and in the         (')
    budget of the Department in subsequent years the item for           .
    land commissioners' fees, as in prior years, and continue such
    budgeting until the Davis Select Subcommittee on Real Prop­
    erty Acquisition has completed its studies and made its report,
    recommendations and legislative proposals.
  At the appropriations hearings on the requests of the
General Services Administration for funds for the pur­
chase of furniture and furnishings for the courts during
the fiscal year 1964, a question arose as to the validity of
the estimates submitted by GSA. Through the cooperation
of the subcommittee chairman, the Administrative Office
                                                                                l
                                                                                .
reviewed the estimates and found them to be much too high,
and the Committee was so advised.

          BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   The Chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy Admin­
istration, Circuit Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., presented
                                                                      ( )
                                       23

        to the Conference the following resolution with respect to
        the service of Circuit Judge Albert V. Bryan, who has
        resigned from the Committee. The Conference concurred
        unanimously in the resolution and directed that it be trans­
        mitted to Judge Bryan.
                 WHEREAS the Judicial Conference at its September
            1942 session authorized the Chief Justice of the United States
            to appoint a committee to consider and report on matters of
            bankruptcy administration, and
                 WHEREAS pursuant to this authorization a standing
            bankruptcy committee was created, and
                 WHEREAS the Honorable Albert V. Bryan, then a United
            States District Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia,
            was appointed by Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson as a member
            of that committee in September 1948, and Judge Bryan has
            served continuously and with distinction as a member of the
            Bankruptcy Committee from the date of his appointment,
            continuing in this capacity after his elevation to the United
            States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in August
            1961, and has exhibited unlimited energy and high legal skill
            in dealing with the solution of difficult problems relating to
            bankruptcy, and
    (
                 WHEREAS Judge Bryan through his efforts has con­
            tributed greatly to the improvement of bankruptcy admini­
            stration of the federal court system,
                 NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that we here
            record our sincere appreciation for his services to the Bank­
            ruptcy Committee and to the improvement of bankruptcy
            administration.
           Judge Hamlin also presented the following resolution
(
        with respect to the service of Honorable Edwin L. Covey,
        who retired as Chief of the Bankruptcy Division of the
        Administrative Office of the United States Courts on
        December 31, 1962. The Conference concurred unani­
        mously in the resolution and directed that it be transmitted
        to Mr. Covey.
                WHEREAS Honorable Edwin L. Covey was appointed
           the first Chief of the Bankruptcy Division upon its creation
           in 1942 and served continuously in that capacity for more
           than 20 years, and
                               24

         WHEREAS through the transition from a fee system of
    Referees in Bankruptcy to the present salary system of
    bankruptcy courts Mr. Covey made continuous important
    contributions to the drafting of necessary legislation and the
    organization and management of the present system of bank­
    ruptcy administration, and
         WHEREAS through his untiring devotion to duty and
    the exercise of consummate skill in the supervision of the
    affairs of the bankruptcy courts substantial improvement
    has been accomplished in the past two decades in the econom­
    ical and prompt administration of bankruptcy cases.
         NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that we express
    our profound appreciation to Mr. Covey for his service to the
    Federal Judiciary and extend to him our gratitude and best
    wishes for health and happiness in his retirement.

           SALARIES AND POSITIONS OF REFEREES
   The Conference was informed that the Committee had
met and considered the recommendations contained in the
report of the Director of the Administrative Office, dated
January 25, 1963, relating to the continuance of referee
positions to become vacant by expiration of term, for                (')
changes in salaries of referees, changes in arrangements,
and the creation of new referee positions. The Committee
also considered the recommendations of the district judges
and the judicial councils of the circuits concerned.
   The Conference considered fully the Committee's report
and the recommendations of the Director, judicial councils
and the district judges. On the basis of the report and rec­
ommendations, the Conference took the action shown in
the following table relating to changes in salaries and the
creation of new referee positions, and directed that, unless
otherwise shown, this action become effective on July 1,
1963, or as soon thereafter as appropriated funds are
available:                                       .

                            ApPROPRIATIONS
   The Conference was informed that the appropriation for
salaries of referees for the fiscal year 1963 and the esti­
mates submitted for the fiscal year 1964 will be adequate
for the salaries of referee positions now authorized, but
that a supplemental appropriation of approximately
$77,500 will be needed for salary increases and the addi­
tional referee positions authorized by the Conference at (
this session. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Director of the Administrative Office was authorized to
seek the necessary supplemental appropriation for the
fiscal year 1964.
   The Conference was also informed that the appropria­
tion for the expenses of the offices of referees for the fiscal
year 1963 and the appropriation estimates for fiscal year
1964, if approved by the Congress, will be adequate.
   The Committee noted that appropriations from the
Referees' Salary and Expense Fund during 1963 may ex­
ceed estimated receipts by approximately $100,000 and
that obligations in 1964 may exceed estimated receipts by
approximately $700,000. Presently the fund has a balance
in excess of nine million dollars. In view of the possibility
of an increase in the salary limitations for full-time and
part-time referees, the Committee was of the view that
consideration of a change in the fees and special charges
                             31 


for the support of the fund should be deferred until the
impact of a referees' salary increase can be determined.
                       LEGISLATION
    The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, reaffirmed its approval of the following bills pending
in the 88th Congress, which contain proposals previously
 approved by the Conference:
    (1) Priority Claims, Liens and Title to Property: R.R.
394, 88th Congress, would amend sections 1, 17a, 57j, 64a
 (5), 67b, 67c, and 70c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
 1, 35(a), 93(j), 104(a) (5), 107(b), 107(c) and 110(c),
 relating to priority claims, statutory liens, and title to
property. The bill would preserve the present position of
the costs of administration and of wages in the distribution
of the assets of a bankrupt, and at the same time, would
enable valid contractual liens such as chattel mortgages,
conditional sales contracts, trust receipts, and the like,
to retain their position ahead of statutory liens on per­
sonal property unaccompanied by possession.
    (2) Dischargeability of Debts: R.R. 1047, 88th Con­
gress, would amend Section 2a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11
U.S.C. 11 (a), by adding at the end thereof a new subsec­
tion which would give to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction
to determine the dischargeability or nondischargeability
of provable debts.
    (3) Claims in Chapter XI Cases: R.R. 1049, 88th Con­
ress, would amend various sections of the Bankruptcy
Act and add a new section requiring the filing of claims
in Chapter XI cases and limiting the time within which
claims may be filed to the time prescribed by Section 57n
of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 93 (n).
    (4) Attorneys' Fees: R.R. 2833, 88th Congress, would
amend Section 60d of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 96
 (d), to give the bankruptcy court authority on its own
motion to re-examine attorneys' fees paid or to be paid
in a bankruptcy proceeding.

    (5) Summary Jurisdiction: H.R. 2848, 88th Congress,
 would amend Sections 60b, 67e and 70e, of the Bankruptcy        (
 Act, 11 U.S.C. 96(b), 107(e), and 110(e), to give the
 bankruptcy court summary jurisdiction in actions brought
 under those sections involving preferences, liens and
 fraudulent transfers, and the trustee's title to property.
    (6) Deposit of Bankruptcy Funds: H.R. 2849, 88th
 Congress, would authorize the deposit of funds of bank­
rupt estates in interest-bearing accounts under proper
safeguards.
    (7) Rules of Practice and Procedure: H.R. 2859, 88th
Congress, would provide for the promulgation of rules of
practice and procedure under the Bankruptcy Act, by the
Supreme Court of the United States.
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, took no action on the following bills, relating to claims
for wages and other related claims, which are pending in
the 88th Congress and which appear to involve questions
of public policy:
    (1) H.R. 66 to increase the amount of wages entitled         (
to priority to $1,800 and to provide that pension and wel­
fare benefits earned by an employee shall have the same
priority as direct wages;
    (2) H.R. 549 and H.R. 710 to amend the Bankruptcy
Act with respect to the priority of debts owed by a bank­
rupt to workmen, servants, clerks and certain salesmen;
    (3) H.R. 1052 to amend Section 64 (a) (2) of the Bank­
ruptcy Act; and
    (4) H.R. 1784 to increase the amount of wages entitled
to priority to $2,000, to provide that pension, welfare, and
other fringe benefits shall be treated as wages, and to in­
crease the priority period from three months to twelve
months with respect to certain wage components.
        REFEREES' RETIREMENT AND SALARY BILL
  H.R. 2556, 88th Congress, would amend the Bank­
                                                                 (
                                  33 


    ruptcy Act and the Civil Service Retirement Act, gener­
    ally, to provide:
       (a) 	Terms of twelve years for full-time referees;
       (b) 	 An increase in the maximum salary limitation for
             a full-time referee from $15,000 to $20,000 per
             annum, and for a part-time referee from $7,500 to
             $10,000 per annum;
       (c) 	 A salary for the chief of the Bankruptcy Division
            of the Administrative Office at an amount which is
             not less than the maximum rate of compensation
             of a full-time referee;
       (d) 	 A more liberal retirement annuity for referees,
             in general, comparable to the retirement benefits
             now provided for members of Congress and man­
             datory retirement for referees at age 75 under cer­
             tain conditions.
    Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference
    approved the bill.
           SALARY OF THE REFEREE IN THE WESTERN
(                  DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA
       The Conference in March 1962 changed the referee
    position authorized for the Western District of Louisiana
    from a part-time basis to a full-time basis, effective July 1,
    1962, or as soon thereafter as appropriated funds were
    available. Pursuant to this authorization, the part-time
    referee closed his private law practice and entered on full­
    time duty as a referee on July 1, 1962. The Appropriation
    Act, however, was not approved until October 18, 1962,
    and during this period of approximately three and one­
    half months the referee performed full-time service, but
    continued to receive compensation as a part-time referee.
    The Conference was informed that the judges of the
    Western District of Louisiana have urged that steps be
    taken to bring about the payment to the referee of the
    difference between the salary of a full-time and a part­
    time referee for the service performed during this period.
                                34 


The Committee reported that a special bill of relief will be
introduced in Congress and recommended that the Con-                     (­
ference express its approval of such bill. This recommen­
dation was approved by the Conference.

              AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   The Administrative Office had reported to the Commit­
tee that there had been a marked improvement in the
situation with respect to the matter of errors in the com­
putation of amounts due the salary and expense fund and
overpayments of compensation to receivers and trustees.
   In view of this improved situation, the Committee re­
ported that it had restudied the resolution presented to
the Conference at its session in September 1962 in regard
to the accountability of referees, receivers, and trustees
for administrative errors. Upon recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference adopted the following amended
resolution:
        Resolved, That the Administration Office be authorized
   and directed to continue the policy of requiring referees to
   cause a thorough audit to be made of all accounts of receivers
   and trustees and to require strict compliance by them with
   all the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act relating thereto;
   that the Administrative Office continue its policy of auditing
   the statistical reports of closed cases; that receivers and
   trustees shall be held personally accountable for any errors
   in the computation of receivers' and trustees' compensation;
   and that referees shall be held personally accountable for ad­
   ministrative, as distinguished from judicial, errors in the com­
   putation of such compensation and of charges for the Referees'
   Salary and Expense Fund disclosed by the audit of statistical
   reports of closed cases; provided that while the Administra­
   tive Office is required to call all such errors to the attention of
   the referees concerned, steps to enforce the personal account­
   ability of referees may be taken only after the expressed
   approval of the Bankruptcy Committee of the Judicial
   Conference.

                                                                         ()

         DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER XIII
      The Committee reported that for the past two years the
    Administrative Office has required detailed reports on
    Chapter XIII cases which, after careful analysis, reveal
    a marked lack of uniformity in the operation of the offices
    of trustees in the following respects:
       (1) Allowance of fees to attorneys for debtors;
       (2) Compensation of Chapter XIII trustees;
       (3) Allowances for trustees' expenses;
       (4 ) Over-all costs of administration;
       (5) Record-keeping systems;
       (6 ) Trustees' bonds.
    The Chairman of the Committee has, therefore, appointed
    a subcommittee consisting of Chief Judge Seybourn H.
    Lynne, Chairman, and District Judges Edward Weinfeld
    and Wesley E. Brown, to study and recommend guidelines
    for all phases of the administration of Chapter XIII cases.
                  EXAMINATION OF BANKRUPTS
(      In some districts, it appears that certain hearings in
    bankruptcy cases are held in so-called examining rooms
    out of the presence of the referee. These proceedings may
    or may not be recorded and counsel for the bankrupt may
    or may not be present. It was the view of the Committee
    that every proceeding in a bankruptcy court should be
    conducted in open court with a judge or referee presiding.
    Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
    ence thereupon adopted the following resolution:
              Resolved, That it is the sense of the Conference that all
        first meetings of creditors and continuations thereof should
        be conducted in the presence of the referee to whom the case
        has been referred.
                  MATTERS UNDER ADVISEMENT
      It had been brought to the attention of the Committee
    that some referees have held submitted matters under ad­
    visement for excessively long periods. At present there is
                            36

no system for obtaining reports on submitted matters sim­
ilar to the system of reporting by district judges. The Con-     (
ference was informed that the matter is currently under
consideration by the Committee, and that Judge Wesley                 I
E. Brown has been requested to formulate recommenda-                 I
                                                                     I
tions and report to the Committee at its next meeting.               rij
    INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES 

   The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Inter­ 

circuit Assignments, Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported
on the processing of requests for intercircuit assignments.
                                                                     I
Since its last report the Committee has recommended
favorably on 22 intercircuit assignments. No adverse rec­
ommendation has been made. The judges receiving inter­
circuit assignments during the period include 4 circuit
judges, 5 senior circuit judges, 5 district judges, 5 senior
district judges, and 2 senior judges of the special courts.
The Committee reported that the situation in the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, due to a heavy caseload and
the illness of 2 judges, has required special attention. Two (
active and two retired circuit judges from out of the
circuit have been assigned to that Court for a total of 6
weeks' service during the winter and spring of 1963.
   The Committee had previously informed the Conference
that it would undertake a further study and evaluation of
intercircuit assignments in the light of the filling of the
judgeship positions created by the Act of May 19, 1961.
On the basis of the study, the Committee concluded that
the assignment of judges among the circuits and the special
courts is a substantial and important benefit to the federal
judicial system and should be continued. Upon recommen­
dation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
following principles and procedures for intercircuit
assignments :
   (1) 	 The business of any court in the first instance 

        should be handled by the judges appointed to it or 

                                  37 


            by senior judges from within or without the cir­
            cuit. Assistance for a circuit or district court should
            be secured by an intracircuit assignment if reason­
            ably possible. Resort should be had to an assignment
            of an active judge from another circuit or special
            court only when the assistance cannot be supplied
            from within the circuit or by the service of a senior
            judge from without the circuit.
       (2) 	 When an assignment is needed from another cir­
            cuit or to or from a special court, consideration
            should be given to the relative availability of the
            judges whose services might be secured and to the
            travel costs incidental to the assignment.
       (3) 	Requests for intercircuit assignments or for as­
            signments to the special courts shall be made by the
            Chief Judge of the circuit or special court in need,
            shall be addressed to the Chief Justice, and shall
            be accompanied by:
             (a) 	A certificate of need together with a statement
(	                of the reason for the need and, except on re­
                  quests from a special court, of the inability
                  to supply that need by an intracircuit
                  assignment;
            (b) 	In the case of an active judge, a consent to
                  the assignment by the chief judge of the cir­
                  cuit or special court from which the assign­
                  ment is to be made together with a statement
                  of the availability of the judge to be assigned;
                  and,
            (c) 	In the case of a senior judge, a statement from
                  him expressing his willingness to serve.

       ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
        The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration
     of the Criminal Law, Judge William F. Smith, presented
     the report of the Committee.
                            38 


                       LEGISLATION

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­          (
tee, reaffirmed its approval of the proposals contained in
the following bills introduced in the 88th Congress, which
had been previously approved by the Conference:
    (1) H.J. Res. 24, 88th Congress, to authorize the
Attorney General to establish an Institute of Corrections
for the training and instruction of corrections personnel
selected by states and their municipal subdivisions in the
field of correctional methods and techniques. (Conf. Rept.,
Sept. 1961, p. 97)
    (2) H.R. 2847, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 633
to prescribe a new schedule of fees payable to United
States commissioners and to increase the maximum al­
lowance from $10,500 to $12,500 per annum. (Conf. Rept.,
Sept. 1961, p. 93)
    (3) H.R. 2838, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 753
 (f) to authorize the payment of fees for transcripts fur­
nished indigent defendants in proceedings under 28 U.S.C.
2255. (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1961, p. 100)                        (
    (4) H.R. 2834, 88th Congress, to amend 18 U.S.C. 751
and 752 to provide a lesser punishment for the crimes of
escape, where the person in custody is a committed juvenile
delinquent. (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1961, p. 96.)
    ( 5) H.R. 1634, 88th Congress, to amend the Criminal
Code to protect any person in his right to accept and hold
federal office and to discharge the duties thereof free from
coercion, threats and intimidation. (Conf. Rept., Sept.
1961, p. 99.)
    (6) H.R. 1833, 88th Congress, would amend 18 U.S.C.
3401 (a) and (b) to enlarge the trial jurisdiction of spe­
cially designated United States commissioners. Under the
bill, the authority of such commissioners would be defined
as "jurisdiction to try and sentence a person committing
an offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than
one year or by a fine of not more than $1,000 or both." The
                               39 


bill retains the provision that a defendant may elect to be
tried before the district court, but eliminates the present
statutory requirement that he be apprised of his right to
a trial in the district court, and sign a written consent to
trial before the commissioner. The bill is identical with
H.R. 3094, 87th Congress, approved by the Conference in
September 1961 (Conf. Rept., p. 95) with an amendment
restoring the requirement that the United States commis­
sioner apprise the defendant of his right to elect to be
tried before the district court and prohibiting him from
proceeding to try the case unless the defendant, after being
so apprised, signs a written consent to be tried before the
commissioner. The Conference reaffirmed its approval of
the proposal contained in H.R. 1833 as thus amended.
   (7) H.R. 2842, 88th Congress, to amend 18 U.S.C.
3238 to establish trial venue as to crimes not committed
in any district. (Conf. Rept., Mar. 1960, p. 25)
            MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENOES
  S. 863, 88th Congress, would amend the Federal Youth
Corrections Act by adding the following new section:
    Sec. 5027. The provisions of this chapter shall be applicable
    to all persons otherwise eligible, who are convicted of viola­
    tions of any Federal penal law relating to narcotics notwith­
    standing the fact that a mandatory penalty is prescribed for
    any such violation.
   The proposed legislation would not only make available
the provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act in
criminal cases involving violations of the narcotics laws,
and particularly the sentencing alternatives available un­
der 18 U.S.C. 5010, but would also make available the same
provisions to a young adult offender, 18 U.S.C. 4209, upon
a determination by the court that there is reasonable
ground to believe that the defendant will benefit from
treatment under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.
   S. 794, 88th Congress, would also amend the criminal
code in regard to mandatory minimum sentences in nar­
                              40 


 cotics cases. Section 1 of the bill would authorize the im­
 position of sentence under 18 U.S.C. 4208(e) on a               :(
 defendant convicted of a violation of the narcotics laws,
 if at the time of the offense he "was an addict as defined in
section 2(k) of the Public Health Service Act," 42 U.S.C.
201 (k) and "if the court finds that there is reasonable
ground to believe that the defendant will benefit from the
treatment provided under section 4208." Section 2 would
amend 18 U.S.C. 4209 to authorize the imposition of sen­
tence under the Federal Youth Corrections Act on a
"young adult offender" if at the time of the offense he
"was an addict" and "if the court finds that there is rea­
sonable ground to believe that the defendant will benefit
from the treatment provided under section 4209." Section
3 would add a subdivision (d) to 26 U.S.C. 7237 to make
the mandatory minimum penalties inapplicable in the case
of an addict "if the court finds that there is reasonable
ground to believe that the defendant will benefit from
treatment provided under Sections 4208 and 4209."
    The proposals contained in S. 794 are identical with         ( .
those contained in S. 2619, 87th Congress, approved by
the Conference in March 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 20). It
was the view of the Committee that the proposed amend­
ment to 18 U.S.C. 4209 is more restrictive than the
amendment proposed by R 863, supra, in that it is
limited to young adult offenders who are "addicts" and
does not cover the young adult first offender. Upon recom­
mendation of the Committee, the Conference approved S.
863 and S. 794 insofar as it does not conflict with S. 863.
          ADVISORY COMMISSION ON NARCOTIC
                   AND DRUG ABUSE
   Judge Smith advised the Conference that the President's
Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse is
presently engaged in a study of the federal narcotics laws
to determine what new legislation and what amendments
                                                                 c/
                             41 


to existing legislation may be desirable. In this respect,
the views of the Conference on existing laws as to the
desirability of mandatory minimum sentences and the
existing prohibition against probation and parole have
been requested. The Committee was authorized to coop­
erate with the Advisory Commission and to report to the
Conference on proposals formulated by the Commission.
  PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO COUNSEL ApPOINTED
    TO REPRESENT POOR PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME
   The Deputy Attorney General had recently brought to
the attention of the Committee a proposed "Criminal
Justice Act of 1963" prepared by the Attorney General's
Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Federal
Criminal Justice of which Professor Francis Allen is the
Chairman. This draft bill contains features not contained
in the bill previously approved by the Conference, S. 2900,
87th Congress, and not included in S. 63, H.R. 1027 and
H.R. 3504, which have been introduced in the 88th
Congress.
   The Committee had previously discussed with repre­
sentatives of the Allen Committee (a) the desirability of
legislation to meet adequately the many problems pre­
sented by the indigent defendant; (b) the relative merits
of S. 63, 88th Congress (which is similar to S. 2900, 87th
Congress) and the proposed Criminal Justice Act; (c)
the status of legal aid societies and others in the operation
of a plan; and (d) the problems of administration under
S. 63 and the proposed Criminal Justice Act. It was the
view of the Committee that these matters required further
stUdy. After full discussion, the Conference thereupon
authorized the Committee to reconsider S. 63, 88th Con­
gress, and other pending legislation to provide for the
payment of compensation to counsel representing indigent
defendants in the light of the most recent developments
and to cooperate with representatives of the Attorney
General and with the members of the Allen Committee.

                                                                        I
               PROTRACTED CRIMINAL CASES

   There had been brought to the attention of the Commit­
tee the request of Chief Judge Lumbard for the considera­
tion of certain problems presented in protracted criminal
                                                                        I
cases. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference referred to the standing Committee on Rules of
Practice and Procedure the following proposals:
    (1) 	 That the number of alternate jurors permitted in a crim~
          inal case be increased from 4 to 8; and
    (2) 	 That the courts be authorized to substitute an alternate
          juror for a juror who becomes ill or disabled during
          deliberations.
   The proposal that provision be made for the substitution
of a judge for another who becomes ill or disabled during
the trial of a protracted case was referred to the Commit­
tees on Court Administration and Revision of the Laws
for study and report to the Conference.
             THE ADMINISTRATION OF 

             THE PROBATION SYSTEM 
                                  (: 

   Judge Luther W. Youngdahl, Chairman of a Special
Committee appointed by the Chief Justice to consider the
recommendation of the Director of the Administrative
Office for the creation of a standing Committee of the Con­
ference on the Administration of the Probation System,
reported that the Committee had met and considered sug­
gestions and comments from representatives of the Depart­
ment of Justice and the chairmen of Judicial Conference
Committees whose responsibilities touch on the adminis­
tration of the probation system. It was the consensus of
the Committee that the needs and problems of the proba­
tion system may best be met through a permanent stand­
ing Committee of the Judicial Conference.
   The Judicial Conference accepted the report of the
Special Committee and authorized the creation of a stand­
ing Committee on the Administration of the Probation
                             43 


System with additional responsibility for organizing in­
stitutes and joint councils on sentencing.

              SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
  The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Person­
nel, Chief Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report of
the Committee to the Conference.

                    COURT REPORTERS

   The Conference was informed that the Committee had
considered, jointly with the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration matters pertaining to the court reporting system,
and that the Committee had concurred in the recommen­
dations of the Committee on Court Administration pre­
sented above.
   The Conference in September 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 37)
had authorized the Committee to consider further the ad­
visability of altering the present policy of providing one
court reporter for each district judge. The Committee re­
ported that the situation in the district court from which
the request had emanated has now been alleviated and
that there are no further requests pending. The Conference
accordingly approved the recommendation of the Commit­
tee that there be no change in the present policy.
   The Committee also reported that it had received a re­
quest from the Chief Judge of the District of Oregon for
a change in the designation of the court reporters in that
district from nonmetropolitan to metropolitan. It was
the view of the Committee that, while the request appears
to have merit, the situation in other districts should also
be considered. Accordingly the Committee requested and
was granted leave to study the question of whether or not
the two. categories of court reporters should be combined
and to report thereon to the Conference at its next session.

       FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' SALARY REFORM ACT
   The Federal Employees' Salary Reform Act of 1962            (
authorized salary increases to Government employees gen­
erally. Salaries of court reporters, however, are fixed by
the Conference and salaries of National Park Commis­
sioners must be approved by the Conference. In view of
the long period of delay which would have been required
to await action by the Conference, a meeting of the Ad­
visory Committee of the Conference was held to consider
the recommendations of the Director of the Administrative
Office which would permit salary increases to these em­
ployees similar to those provided in the salary increase
act. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
ence affirmed the action of the Advisory Committee in
approving the recommendations of the Director.
   The Conference also affirmed the action of the Advisory
Committee in approving the changes in the within-grade
promotional plan for the supporting personnel recom­
mended by the Director.
  PERSONNEL IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
                                                               (,
   At the request of the Administrative Office, a study was
made of the personnel situation in the office of the clerk
in the Eastern District of New York by an examiner of
the Department of Justice. The report of the examiner
which indicates no emergency need for additional person­
nel was received shortly prior to the Committee's recent
meeting and a copy has been forwarded to the court. While
the court has not had an opportunity for a full study of
the report, it was the view of the Committee that no recom­
mendation need be made on its part, nor is any action re­
quired unless further representations are made by the
court.
              COURT REPORTER-SECRETARY
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, increased the salary of the combination court reporter­
                            45 


secretary to the District Judge in the Canal Zone to $8,310
per annum, which is the same as the salary authorized
for other combination positions of this type.

          DRAFT DEFERMENT OF LAW CLERKS

  It was brought to the attention of the Committee that
some law clerks to judges had obtained deferments from
draft boards, while others were denied deferments. In view
of the differentiation in treatment of deferments for law
clerks, the Committee requested the advice of the Director
of the Selective Service System, General Lewis B. Hershey,
and obtained from him a letter explaining the situation.
It was the view of the Committee that, on the basis of
General Hershey's letter, the matter is one for individual
determination by individual judges. Upon recommendation
of the Committee, the Director of the Administrative Office
was authorized to transmit a copy of the letter from
General Hershey to all judges.

                ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL

  Several requests have been received for additional per­
manent positions in various court offices. However, in view
of the decision of the Conference at its September 1962
session that the request for funds for additional person­
nel should be deferred pending congressional action on
funds to implement the judicial salary plan, no action has
been taken by the Committee. The Administrative Office,
however, has reported that it has been in a position to
supply temporary personnel in every instance where the
need appeared to be urgent.

                JUDICIAL STATISTICS
   The Chairman of the Committee on Judicial Statistics,
Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, presented the report
of the Committee to the Conference.
                             46 


DISPOSITION OF CIVIL CASES PENDING OVER THREE YEARS
    Chief Judge Johnsen reported that the Committee had       r'
 reviewed the results of the efforts of the district courts
 during the past year to effect disposition of the civil cases
 pending for more than three years, in relation to the res­
olution of the Conference in September 1961 (Conf. Rept.,
 p. 63) declaring it "to be the policy of the judiciary that
 every case pending three years or more and appropriate
 for trial be regarded as a judicial emergency by all the
 judges of any circuit where such cases are to be found."
 The statistics developed by the Committee and reported
 to the Conference are indicative that a special effort was
made during the fiscal year 1962 to deal with these cases,
although the plan was not effective throughout the entire
year. It was the view of the Committee that it would serve
no real purpose to continue to urge the program of deal­
ing with these cases on an emergency basis beyond the
present fiscal year.                           .
    The Committee, therefore, recommended that the dis- :(,,'
trict courts be requested to deal with all such cases during   .
each fiscal year hereafter in regular programmed effort;
that this programmed effort be directed at attempting to
effect disposition of such cases as are left in that category
at the end of the preceding fiscal year and as many as pos­
sible of those which will reach that category during the cur­
rent fiscal year; that to assist in this task the Division
of Procedural Studies and Statistics be directed to con­
tinue the procedure of the past two years, while the emer­
gency program has been in effect, of sending to the Chief
Judge of each circuit after the close of each fiscal year
lists of the cases pending in each of the district courts of
the circuit more than three years, for transmittal to such
courts; that a general table showing the number of such
cases pending and of the terminations made during each
fiscal year be included in the Annual Report of the Direc­
tor; that such general table, for comparative purposes,
                             47 

be cumulatively made to show the figures commencing
with fiscal 1961, when the emergency program began;
and that the Division of Procedural Studies and Statis­
tics be further directed to prepare tables of greater detail
for the use of the Judicial Council of each Circuit in re­
viewing the nature of such suits. This recommendation
was approved by the Conference.
                 ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIP
   The Committee had been requested to review the need
for an additional district judgeship in the Southern Dis­
trict of Alabama which, in the opinion of the district judge
and the judicial council of the Fifth Circuit, is needed.
The Committee reported that the situation in the dis­
trict remains essentially the same as it existed prior to
and at the time of the consideration of the Omnibus Judge­
ship Act of 1961, and was of the view that such help as
is currently needed in the district ought to be able to be
provided by judicial assistance from other districts in
the circuit. The Committee concluded, therefore, that it
ought not at this time recommend to the Conference
creation of an additional judgeship for the district. The
Conference concurred in the views of the Committee.
                   STATISTICAL TABLES
   The Conference upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee approved the omission of Table C 8, showing the length
of civil and criminal trials by nature of suit, from the
Annual Report of the Director for the fiscal year 1962.
The revision of Table C 10, relating to the median time
interval from issue to trial, by the addition of percentiles
thereto to show the range of time intervals for the middle
80 per cent of all civil cases tried was also approved by the
Conference.
                   WEIGHTED CASELOAD
   The Committee had been informed by the Administra­
tive Office that further tests of the weighted caseload
                            48

table, authorized to be published in the Annual Report of
the Director for 1962 (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1962, p. 41)
were of such a general consistency as to lend support to
                                                              r
the over-all ratios used in determining the weighted case-
load. It was found, however, that the weighted values used
in relation to total filings cannot be given application to
evaluate the workload of the cases reaching the trial
calendar.
            CRIMINAL OFFENDER STATISTICS
  The Conference was informed that the Division of
Procedural Studies and Statistics is now obtaining from
the probation officers additional information concerning
defendants sentenced and convicted during the fiscal year
1963. The Division is also receiving through the Federal
Bureau of Investigation copies of criminal record sheets
on all defendants under probation or parole supervision.

                    OTHER MATTERS
   The Committee reported that the Division of Procedural ()
Studies and Statistics is undertaking this year to distrib­
ute certain standardized statistical tables for use at some
of the Judicial Conferences of the Circuits as a convenient
means for general consideration and discussion of the
situations of the courts of the circuits. These compilations
are being provided on an experimental basis and their
desirability will be further considered by the Committee.

               PRETRIAL PROCEDURE
   The Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure,
Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, presented an oral report
to the Conference.
          SEMINAR FOR NEW DISTRICT JUDGES
  The Conference in September 1962 (Con£. Rept., p. 43)
had authorized the Committee on Pretrial Procedure
                                 49 


    to conduct an annual seminar commencing in 1963 for re­
    cently appointed district judges. Judge Murrah informed
    the Conference that plans were being formulated for
    a seminar this year in Denver, Colorado, to be held at the
    University of Denver during the week of July 28. Approx­
    imately 25 recently appointed district judges, including
    a few who were unable to attend a seminar last year, will
    be invited to participate. While the details of the program
    have not been worked out, the format will remain approx­
    imately the same as in prior seminars.

           SUBCOMMITTEE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION

       The Subcommittee of the Pretrial Committee, appointed
    to consider discovery problems arising in multiple litiga­
    tion with common witnesses and exhibits, has continued
    its efforts toward the solution of problems presented by
    the antitrust treble damage actions which arose out of the
    criminal antitrust proceedings in the electrical equipment
    industry in Philadelphia in 1961. At a meeting of the
(   judges having responsibility for the litigation, which was
    held in San Antonio in February, the status of the litiga­
    tion in all districts was reviewed and plans were formu­
    lated for completing the discovery phase of the litigation
    and for the disposition of certain basic legal issues prior
    to the setting of these cases for trial and disposition. The
    first series of nationwide depositions has been completed
    and a second series, begun in March, is expected to be com­
    pleted in July. A detailed report of the activities of the
    subcommittee was presented to the Conference.

            OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
      Chief Judge Sylvester J. Ryan, on behalf of Chief Judge
    Harry E. Watkins, Chairman of the Committee on the
    Operation of the Jury System, submitted the report of the
    Committee.
                             50

                      FEES OF JURORS
   The Committee reported that judges and jurors had
expressed concern regarding the inadequacy of compen­
sation to jurors. In view of the prevailing wage scales
and the increased cost of living, the Committee accordingly
recommended that the per diem allowance of grand and
petit jurors be increased from $7.00 to $10.00 per day
and where any juror is requested to attend more than 30
days in hearing one case, that the per diem fee of such
juror, to be paid in the discretion of and upon certification
by the trial judge, be increased from $10.00 to $14.00 for
each day in excess of 30 days the juror is required to hear
such case.
   Dpon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved the proposal and directed that the proposed in­
crease in the per diem for jurors be combined with the
previous recommendation of the Conference for an in­
crease in the subsistence allowance of jurors from $7.00
to $10.00 as set forth in H.R. 5616, 87th Congress. A
revised bill to amend 28 D.S.C. 1871, which includes these
recommendations, was approved by the Conference.
                 JURY COMMISSION BILL
  Chief Judge Ryan reported that the Jury Commission
Bill, approved by the Conference in September 1962 (Conf.
Rept., p. 47) , had been introduced as H.R. 3284 in the 88th
Congress.
                   OTHER LEGISLATION
  The following bill containing a proposal previously ap­
proved by the Conference has also been introduced in
the 88th Congress: H.R. 2839 to increase the fees of jury
commissioners from $5.00 to $10.00 per day.
  H.R 544, 88th Congress, would provide that in a civil
case the number of jurors required to constitute a jury
and the number who must agree for a valid verdict, shall
be determined by the law of the state in which the action
                             51 


is tried. The proposal contained in this bill had previously
been disapproved by the Conference.

        PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE
             COURTS OF APPEALS
   At the request of Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, the
Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that
terms of the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit at
places other than St. Louis be pretermitted during the
fiscal year commencing July 1, 1963.
   At the request of Chief Judge Murrah, the Conference
consented that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth
Circuit at places other than Denver and Oklahoma City
be pretermitted during the fiscal year commencing July
1, 1963.
   At the request of Chief Judge Simon E. Sobeloff, the
Conference consented to the pretermission of the term of
court of the Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit sched­
uled at Asheville in June 1963, if the Court so decides.

   PLACES OF HOLDING COURT IN VERMONT
   On motion of Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard the Con­
ference approved a proposal to add Montpelier and St.
Johnsbury as additional places of holding court in the
District of Vermont.

      RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
  The Conference authorized immediate release of its
action on matters considered at this session, where neces­
sary for legislative or administrative action.
  For the Judicial Conference of the United States.
