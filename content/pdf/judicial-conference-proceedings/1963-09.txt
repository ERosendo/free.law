REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINIS­

 COURTS
   Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts, had previously sub­
mitted to the members of the Conference his report for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1963, in accordance with
the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 604(a) (3). The Conference
approved the immediate release of the report for publica­
tion and authorized the Director to revise and supplement
the final printed edition to be issued later.

                                                               o

                        STATE OF THE DOCKETS
(-,        Courts of Appeals-Cases filed in the Courts of Appeals
        during the fiscal year 1963 again increased sharply to a
        record 5,437 cases, an increase of 614 cases over the pre­
        vious year or almost 13 per cent. Cases disposed of also
        increased to 5,011, but failed to keep pace with filings.
        The result was an increase in the number of appeals pend­
        ing in the Courts of Appeals on June 30, 1963 to a record
        3,457. Appeals filed in the Court of Appeals for the Dis­
      . trict of Columbia Circuit and in the Fifth Circuit in­
        creased more than 20 per cent. The increase in the judi­
        cial business in the Courts of Appeals results almost en­
        tirely from an increase in appeals from judgments of
        district courts.
           District Courts-Civil cases filed in the United States
        District Courts during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1963
        increased 3 percent to a record 63,630. There were 62,379
        civil cases terminated, or 1,250 less than the number filed.
        As a result, the pending backlog on June 30, 1963 in­
        creased to a record 69,219 civil cases. There was a sharp
        increase this year in habeas corpus applications in the dis­
        trict courts brought by petitioners in custody pursuant to
        the judgment of a state court. Over-all there was no in­
        crease in the number of tort actions filed. Notwithstand­
        ing the increase in pending civil cases, significant progress
        has been made in reducing the number of civil actions
        pending for more than three years.
           The median time interval from filing to disposition of
        civil cases terminated by trial in the district courts in 1963
        was 16 months, the 'same as in 1962. The median time
        interval from issue to trial was 10 months, also the same
        as in the previous year.
           Criminal proceedings were brought against 36,168 de.­
        fendants during the fiscal year 1963; charges against
        36,265 defendants were disposed of during the year; and
        on June 30, 1963 there were 12,813 defendants awaiting

                             58 

prosecuted in the district courts has not varied appreciably
for many years. For the most part the criminal dockets
of the district courts are current.                            f)' 

    The bankruptcy business of the district courts increased
more than 5 percent in 1963 with record filings of 155,493
cases. The increase, which occurred entirely in the last
6 months of the fiscal year, was mostly in employee or
wage-earner type cases, as business bankruptcies continue
to constitute only 10 percent of total filings. There were
141,440 bankruptcy cases closed during the year, or al­
most 4,000 more than in the previous year. However,
filings once again exceeded terminations by almost 7,500
cases and the pending caseload increased for the eleventh
consecutive year to an all-time high of 147,814.

            JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief
Judge William J. Campbell, submitted to the Conference
the appropriation estimates for the judiciary for the fis­     ('
cal year 1965. The estimates, which had been prepared           )
by the Director of the Administrative Office pursuant to
28 U.S.C. 605 and which were examined and approved by
the Committee, total $67,082,000, an increase of $4,344,­
500 over the appropriations approved by the House of
Representatives for the fiscal year 1964. At the time the
appropriation estimates for the fiscal year 1965 were pre­
pared, Congress had not completed action on the 1964 ap­            "
propriations bill. On recommendation of the Committee,
the appropriation estimates presented were approved by
the Conference.
   The Director of the Administrative Office was further
authorized to revise the budget estimates for the fiscal
year 1965, or, in the alternative, to submit to Congress
estimates of supplemental appropriations in the event
of the passage of legislation increasing the salaries of
judges, referees, and other officers and employees of the

                                                               u

                                 59
      courts, and for any other purpose which could not be an­
     ticipated at the time of this submission.
(       Included in the budget estimates for the fiscal year
      1965 are requests for funds for the employment of 44
     additional probation officers, 33 additional clerk stenog­
     raphers for probation offices, 15 deputy clerks for the
     United States courts of appeals, and a clerical position in
      the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
     The estimates also include requests for funds for two ad­
     ditional full-time referees in bankruptcy, the conversion
     of two part-time referees to full-time status, the salary
     increases in certain referee positions approved by the
     Conference at its March 1963 session and an additional
     sum in anticipation of changes in salaries and arrange­
     ments for referees that will be required by March 1964.
        There is also included in the budget estimates the sum
     of $289,000 for the employment of clerks in the offices of
     the referees in bankruptcy on a temporary basis; $780,­
     000 for the continued application of the Judiciary Salary
c)   Plan; $625,000 for within-grade salary increases; and
     $123,000 for reimbursement to the General Services Ad­
     ministration for tenant alterations and services. The
     appropriation estimates include an additional sum of
     $460,000 which is the initial cost of commencing a program
     of central disbursement of judiciary appropriations; the
     annual cost of the program in the second and succeeding
     years is estimated to be $38,000. The estimates also
     provide for anticipated increases in the cost of printing,
     supplies, communications, and other miscellaneous ex­
     penses and for a one-year extension of the pretrial exam­
     iner program in the Southern District of New York.
        Judge Campbell called attention to the rapidly increas­
     ing printing costs and the costs of the acquisition of law
     books and suggested that a Committee of the Conference
     be authorized to consider and make recommendations
     concerning the alarming increase in these costs. The
     Conference directed that the matter be referred to the

o
                             60 

Committee on Court Administration for consideration
and report to the Conference.
    SALARIES OF COURT REPORTERS AND NATIONAL 

                PARK COMMISSIONERS 


   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee,. granted authority to the Director of the Administra­
tive Office to increase proportionately the salaries of court
reporters and of national park commissioners, the latter
with the concurrence of the court concerned, in the event
of the enactment of any general pay increase legislation.
            SUPPLEMENTAL ApPROPRIATIONS

  Chief Judge Campbell informed the Conference that the
appropriation requests for the fiscal year 1964 had been
approved by the House of Representatives substantially
as requested and that no appeal had been made to the
Senate Appropriations Committee. The amount included
in the bill for salaries of referees was $50,000 less than
the budget estimate, which will probably necessitate a re­
quest for a supplemental appropriation.
                                                                o
   The Conference approved the report of the Committee
and authorized the immediate release of any information
contained therein as may be necessary in the preparation
and presentation of supplemental or annual appropriation
estimates to the Congress.

              COURT ADMINISTRATION
   The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administra­
tion, Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the report of
the Committee.
                    COURT REPORTERS

   The Conference at its March 1963 session (Conf.Rept.
p. 10) had approved a draft of a bill to amend 28 U.S.C.
753 (b) to permit the use of electronic sound recording
                                                                u
                                  61 

     equipment in the district courts and to authorize court
      reporters to file electronic sound recordings of proceed­
     ings on arraignment, plea and sentence in criminal cases
     in lieu of transcripts as presently required. H.R. 6138,
     containing this proposal, was reported by the House Ju­
     diciary Committee with amendments and, as amended,
      passed the House of Representatives. To a limited de­
     gree, the recommendations of the Judicial Conference
     regarding the filing of electronic sound recordings in lieu
     of transcripts of arraignment, plea and sentence proceed­
     ings were adopted, but the bill would authorize the use of
     an electronic sound recording only in augmentation of the
     record made by shorthand or by mechanical means and
     not in lieu thereof as originally recommended by the Con­
     ference. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
     Conference reaffirmed its approval of the original pro­
     posal and instructed the Director of the Administrative
     Office to present in detail, through the appropriate com­
     mittees of Congress, the reasons for the position of the
c)   Judicial Conference in this respect.
        At the September 1962 session of the Conference, the
     Committees on Court Administration and Supporting
     Personnel were authorized to consider the proposal to in­
     crease the court reporter's fee for the use of a transcript
     in the preparation or perfection of an appeal from 25
     cents to 30 cents per page. The Committees called at­
     tention to the sixth paragraph of 28 U.S.C. 753 (b) which
     provides that both the original notes or other original rec­
     ords and a copy of the transcript in the office of the clerk
     shall be open during office hours to inspection by any per­
     son without charge. In view of this provision of the
     statute, the Committees were of the opinion that the pre­
     vious resolution of the Judicial Conference authorizing
     the payment of a fee to the court reporter for the use of
     the transcript on file in the clerk's office in the prepara­
     tion or perfection of an appeal cannot be supported as a
     matter of law. Upon recommendation of the Commit-

o
                               62 

tees, the Conference thereupon rescinded its resolution of
September 1951 authorizing such fee. (See Conf. Rept.,
Sept. 1951, p. 17.)
                CORPORATE DIRECTORSHIPS

   Chief Judge Biggs brought to the attention of the
Conference H.R. 6048, 88th Congress, which is a bill to
amend 28 U.S.C. 454 to provide criminal penalties for a
justice or a judge of the United States who participates,
other than in the capacity of a stockholder, in an enter­
prise organized for profit. It was the view of the Con­
ference that the bill, as drafted, could be so broadly
construed as to make it practically impossible for a justice
or a judge to participate in the most minor financial
transaction, and further, that if enacted the bill would
become effective immediately which would not give judges
enough time to comply with its provisions prior to its
effective date. H.R. 6048 was therefore disapproved by
the Conference.
   The Conference discussed fully the problem of judges ( )
serving in the capacity of officers, directors, or employees
of corporations organized for profit and adopted the
following resolution:
    "RESOLVED: No justice or judge appointed under the
    authority of the United States shall serve in the capacity of
    an officer, director, or employee of a corporation organized
    for profit."
   The Conference further recommended that if there is
to be legislation, that the following language be substi­
tuted for the provisions of H.R. 6048: "No justice or
judge appointed under the authority of the United States
shall serve in the capacity of an officer, director, or em­
ployee of a corporation organized for profit. This statute
shall take effect 90 days after the date of its enactment."

                       REPORTS OF FINANCIAL STATUS

(          The Conference was informed that the Senate Judiciary
        Committee had requested the views of the Conference on
        S. 1613, 88th Congress. The bill would establish an office
        of reports in each judicial circuit and require judges to
        submit regularly to a registrar complete financial reports
        which would be open for inspection by any member of the
        judicial council of the circuit. It was the view of the Com­
        mittee that regardless of the merits of the proposal, federal
        judges should not be singled out from other officials of the
        United States Government to make such reports. Upon
        recommendation of the Committee, the Conference voted to
        disapprove the bill.
                        SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES
           Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that there
        had been introduced in the 88th Congress S. 1367 relating
        to (1) the selection of the chief judges of the circuits and
        of the multiple-judge district courts; (2) the terms of
(~: 	   service of chief judges; and (3) the powers and respon­
        sibilities of chief judges with respect to the general ad­
        ministrative superintendence of the business of the circuit
        and district courts. The bill is identical with S. 1268 of
        the 87th Congress. On motion of Judge Biggs, the Com­
        mittee was authorized to give further consideration to the
        proposals contained in this bill.

                    AMENDMENT OF 28 U.S.C. 372 (b)
          S. 1368, 88th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 372 (b)
        to provide for the appointment of an additional judge,in a
        court where a judge has served 10 years and has reached
        the age of 70 and the judicial council of the circuit has
        recommended the appointment of an additional judge.
        The bill would also provide that whenever a judge is so
        appointed, the vacancy subsequently caused by the death,


o           711~02--63----8
                             64

resignation, or retirement of the judge by reason of whose
failure to resign or retire from regular active service such
appointment was made, shall not be filled. The Confer-          (j'
ence considered the proposal contained in the bill and
directed the Committee on Court Administration to give
further consideration to the bill in the light of the discus­
sion at the Conference.
   The Conference also referred to the Committee for
study a draft resolution which would provide that hence­
forth it shall be the policy of the Judicial Conference not
to recommend to the Congress an additional judgeship in
any district or circuit wherein there is a judge or judges
who are eligible to retire or accept senior status but de­
cline to do so.
 ANNUITIES TO WIDOWS OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Senate Judiciary
Committee had requested the views of the Conference on
S. 1686, 88th Congress, which would amend 28 U.S.C.
375 with respect to the annuities of widows of Supreme          ()
Court justices. It was the view of the Committee that
the bill was the concern of the Supreme Court and not of
the Judicial Conference and accordingly the Conference
took no action with respect to it.
                 ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

   H.R. 4722, 88th Congress, would provide an additional
judgeship for the Eastern District of Virginia. For
several years the district has had a heavy caseload. The
Committees on Court Administration and Judicial Statis­
tics recommended, however, that since there has been no
appreciable change in the caseload and other workload in
this district since the Omnibus Judgeship Act of May 19,
1961 the bill be disapproved at the present time. This
recommendation was approved by the Conference.


                                                                o

        H.R. 6655 and H.R. 6821, 88th Congress, would create
     an additional district and purport to provide four addi­
     tional judgeships for the districts in California. Con­
     sideration of the proposals contained in these bills was
     postponed by the Conference.
        The Conference was informed that the Committees on
     Court Administration and Judicial Statistics were in
     agreement on the need for additional judgeships in the
     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, but
     were divided on the question of a geographical division
     of the Circuit. The Conference thereupon authorized the
     appointment of a special committee on the geographic
     organization of the federal courts with authority to con­
     tinue the study of that subject which has heretofore been
     undertaken by the Committee on Court Administration.
     The committee was directed in particular to study and
     report upon whether there should be a rearrangement or
     division of judicial circuits having large areas or heavy
     caseloads, in particular the Fifth Circuit, and the num­
     ber of active circuit judges required to handle the case­
C)   load of that Circuit. In this connection the committee
     was also authorized to consider and report its judgment
     as to the maximum number of judges which could be
     authorized for the court of appeals of any circuit without
     impairing its efficiency.
        The special committee was also authorized to give con­
     sideration to S. 1876, 88th Congress, which is a bill to
     provide for the creation of an eleventh judicial circuit to
     be comprised of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and
     Washington.
        It was announced by the Chief Justice that the mem­
     bership of the special committee on the Geographical
     Organization of the Courts will include all members of
     the Committee on Court Administration, Chief Judge
     Harvey M. Johnsen and Senior Judge Albert B. Maris
     and additional members to be named later.

6847, and H.R. 6853, 88th Congress, would provide for
various divisional changes or redistricting in the State of
California. The Conference voted to postpone considera­
tion of the proposals contained in these bills.
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, approved the following bills, pending in the 88th
Congress, which had heretofore been approved by the dis­
trict courts and judicial councils of the circuits concerned:
   (1) H.R. 5964 to provide that Hopkins County be in­
cluded in the Paris Division of the Eastern District of
Texas;
   (2) H.R. 4989 to transfer Genesee and Shiawassee
Counties from the Northern Division to the Southern Di­
vision of the Eastern District of Michigan; and
   (3) H.R. 6434 to add New London as an additional
place of holding court in Connecticut.
   The Conference was informed that the Judicial Coun-          ()
cil of the Ninth Circuit had disapproved H.R. 7323 to
provide that court shall be held at Boseman in the Dis­
trict of Montana. Upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee, the Conference voted to disapprove the bill.
   Consideration of the proposal contained in H.R. 7811,
to add Ann Arbor as an additional place of holding court
in the Eastern District of Michigan was postponed by
the Conference pending action by the Judicial Council of
the Sixth Circuit.
  REPORTS OF THE COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS OF 

            THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 

   The Department of Justice had suggested an amend­
ment to the District of Columbia Code to require the
Chief Judge of the Court of General Sessions of the Dis­
trict of Columbia to submit quarterly reports on the work

                                                                o
                                67 


    of that court to the Director of the Administrative Office
    rather than to the Attorney General. It was the sense
    of the Conference that since it was not the duty of the
    Administrative Office to supervise in any way the busi~
    ness of the Court of General Sessions for the District of
    Columbia that it would be inappropriate to require by
    law that reports of that court be filed with the Director.
    Accordingly, the Conference disapproved the suggestion
    of the Department of Justice.
                   PUBLICATION OF OPINIONS

       The Conference was informed of the appointment of a
    subcommittee of the Committee on Court Administration
    to consider possible restrictions on the publication of
    opinions. The subcommittee has been directed to under~
    take a complete study and to report back to the Com­
    mittee.
                     PRETRIAL EXAMINERS

       The Conference at its March 1963 session (Conf. Rept.,
    p. 8) had directed the Committee on Court Administra­
    tion and the Committee on Pretrial Procedure to consider
    the operation of the pretrial examiner systems in the
    United States District Court for the District of Columbia
    and the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of New York, and directed that the survey re­
    ports of the Institute of Judicial Administration be re­
    ferred to the Committees for consideration and report at
    the next session of the Conference. The Committees
    were of the view that the present available information
    furnishes an inadequate basis for a definitive conclusion
    with respect either to the value of these programs in the
    two courts in which they are now in operation, or as to
    their potential value in other courts. The Committees
    accordingly requested and were granted leave to consider
    the matter further. The Conference approved the inclu­
    sion in the appropriation requests of funds for the con-

o
                            68 

tinuation of the pretrial examiner programs in these
districts on the same basis as currently authorized.

  H.R. 5907, 88th Congress, would authorize the payment
by the Government of witness fees and mileage in habeas
corpus cases and in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. 2255
brought by petitioners authorized to proceed in forma
pauperis. The bill had previously been recommended by
the Conference. However, as passed by the House of
Representatives, the bill contained one amendment which
would provide that "fees and mileage need not be ten­
dered to the witness upon service of a subpoena where
the payment is to be made by the United States marshal."
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved the bill as amended.
PAYMENT OF COURT REPORTERS WHO FAIL TO FILE
  TRANSCRIPTS OF PLEAS AND SENTENCING PROCEED­
  INGS IN CRIMINAL CASES AS REQUIRED BY 28 U.S.C.
  753 (b).                                                   o
   The Conference had previously authorized the Director
to withhold the payment of salaries of court reporters
who have not transcribed and filed proceedings on ar­
raignment, plea and sentence in criminal cases as re­
quired by 28 U.S.C. 753 (b), or have not filed electronic
sound recordings of these proceedings as provided in Ad­
ministrative Office Bulletin No. 255. Chief Judge Biggs
informed the Conference that there were 24 court re­
porters who, as of September 7, 1963, had not filed the
certificates which, under the Judicial Conference resolu­
tion are due on September 30, 1963. The Conference
was advised that the Director of the Administrative Office
will immediately furnish to the chief judges of the cir­
cuits concerned the names of the reporters in their cir­
cuits who have not filed the required certificates.

                             CLERKS' FEES

(         The Conference in March 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 6)
       authorized the Administrative Office to undertake a study
       of the existing fee schedules for clerks of court and to re­
       port any suggested changes in fees to the Committee.
       The study and report requested were made but were not
       submitted in time to be given careful consideration by
       the Committee. The Committee was thereupon granted
       leave to consider the matter further and report at the
       next session of the Conference.
                 DISBURSEMENT OF JUDICIARY FUNDS

           In view of the decision to install a central disbursing
       system for the entire federal judicial system, the Com­
       mittee reported that it no longer had under consideration
       the proposal of the Department of Justice that judiciary
       funds be disbursed by clerks of court rather than by
       United States marshals.
         . There was brought to the attention of the Conference
() 	   H.R. 5171, 88th Congress, which would give authority to
       the Administrator of the General Services Administra­
       tion "to coordinate and otherwise provide for the eco­
       nomic and efficient purchase, lease, maintenance operation
       and utilization of electronic data processing equipment
       by federal departments and agencies." The bill specifi­
       cally includes the Judicial Branch in its terms. The
       Committee was of the view that, at least to some extent,
       the proposal would vest operating control of substantive
       administrative programs of the Judicial Branch in the
       head of an agency of the Executive Branch and would
       thus be in conflict with the policy of the Administrative
       Office Act which is to preserve the independence of the
       federal judiciary from possible supervision or control by
       the Executive Branch of the Government. Upon recom­
       mendation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved
       the inclusion of the Judicial Branch in H.R. 5171.

              LEGISLATIVE ApPORTIONMENT 


   The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Rep-
resentatives had requested the views of the Conference
                                                               n
on H.R. 2836, 88th Congress, which is a bill to provide
for congressional districts composed of contiguous and
compact territory, for the election of representatives and
for other purposes. Similar proposals are contained in
H.J. Res. 300, H.J. Res. 349 and H.R. 7343, all of which
are pending in the 88th Congress. The Conference ap­
proved the recommendation of the Committee that no
action be taken on any of these bills, since they are mat­
ters for congressional policy rather than for judiciary
consideration.
                 QUARTERLY BULLETINS

   The Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit had
adopted a resolution requesting that a quarterly bulletin
be issued by the Director of the Administrative Office in­
forming judges of the time and place of Conference com­
mittee meetings, matters of major or general interest          ()
coming before the committees, and also of actions taken
by the Conference on matters of major or general interest
which have been released and are not of a confidential
nature. It was the sense of the Committee that these
proposals would place an undue burden on the committees
of the Conference and on the Administrative Office. Ac­
cordingly, the Conference took no action on the resolution.
                SUBSTITUTION OF JUDGES

  The Conference in March 1963 (Conf. Rept., p. 42)
had referred to the Committees on Court Administration
and Revision of the Laws a proposal that provision be
made for the substitution of a judge for another who be­
comes ill or disabled during the trial of a protracted case.
The Committees recommended that if a judge dies, be­
comes ill, or suffers other disability, by reason of which

                                                               o
                                  71 


     he is unable to continue the trial of a civil or criminal
     case, provision should be made authorizing the substitu­
(	   tion of another judge in the case. The Conference
     approved the recommendation of the Committees and
     referred the proposal to the Standing Committee on Rules
     of Practice and Procedure for the formulation of appro­
     priate rules.
                 CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS

        The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
     tees, disapproved S. 1851, 88th Congress, which is a bill
     to provide that news reporters shall not be required to
     disclose confidential communications in federal courts or
     before committees of Congress and for other purposes.
                     COURTROOM PHOTOGRAPHS

        A resolution of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
     Circuit requesting an amendment of the Judicial Confer­
     ence resolution on the taking of photographs within the
     environs of a courtroom to permit "news media court­
     room photography or telecasting of naturalization or
     ceremonial judicial matters had in accordance with local
     rule of court," was referred to the Committee on Court
     Administration for consideration and report to the Con­
     ference.
                   REVISION OF THE LAWS
       Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Com­
     mittee on Revision of the Laws, submitted the report of
     the Committee.
                            LEGISLATION

       The Conference, on recommendation of the Committee,
     reaffirmed its approval, to the extent indicated, of the fol­
     lowing bills pending in the 88th Congress which embody
     proposals heretofore approved by the Conference:


o
                            72 


   (1) H.R. 3408 and H.R. 6845, 88th Congress, would
provide for the judicial review in the courts of appeals of
actions by the Secretary of Health, Education and Wel­
fare refusing to issue, suspending or revoking any license
for the propagation or manufacture and preparation of
biological products. While expressing no view concern­
ing the policy involved in the proposal, the Conference
had previously approved the type of review provided by
these bills. (Conf. Rept., March 1961, p. 19)
   (2) H.R. 4790, 88th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C.
1391, to permit actions on tort claims to be brought in
the judicial district in which the act or omission com­
plained of occurred. (Conf. Rept., March 1963, p. 17)
   (3) H.R. 5432, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C.
373, to reduce from ten to eight years the period of ju­
dicial service required of a territorial judge in order to
entitle him to receive a retirement annuity. (Conf.
Rept., March 1963, p. 19)
   (4) H.R. 5906, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C.
1446 (b) to substitute 30 days for 20 days as the period
of time fixed therein for filing a petition for removal of    () 

a case from a State to a Federal court. (Conf. Rept.,
March 1963, p. 13)
   (5) H.R. 7031, 88th Congress, to improve judicial
procedures for serving documents, obtaining evidence
and proving documents in litigation with international
aspects. (Conf. Rept., March 1963, p. 15)
   (6) S. 1890 and H.R. 7508, 88th Congress, to amend
28 U.S.C. 1336 and 1398 with respect to cases referred
to the Interstate Commerce Commission by the district           1
courts or the Court of Claims and to establish jurisdic­
tion and venue in appeals from the Commission's orders
in such cases in the courts of referral. (Conf. Rept.,
March 1963, p. 13)
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, reaffirmed its disapproval of the proposals contained
in the following bills pending in the 88th Congress:

                                                              o

                                73

       (1) H.R. 4235, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 2112
    to require that certain proceedings for the review or en­
(
    forcement of agency orders must be instituted in the
    judicial circuit within which the controversy or matter
    which is the subject of the order arose. (Conf. Rept.,
    Sept. 1961,p.80)
       (2) H.R. 4530, 88th Congress, would provide an ad­
    ministrative hearing prior to, and a judicial review after,
    the administrative removal or suspension of a Federal
    employee of the Executive Branch. The Conference had
    previously disapproved as inappropriate a proposal for
    judicial review of this sort of administrative personnel
    action, but expressed no opinion as to the administrative
    procedures proposed by the bill. (Conf. Rept., March
    1961, p. 23)
       (3) H.R. 4939 and H.R. 6357, 88th Congress, would
    provide for the enforcement of support orders in certain
    State and Federal courts and make it a crime to move or
    travel in interstate or foreign commerce to avoid com­
    pliance with such orders. The Conference had previously
    expressed disapproval of those provisions of the proposed
    legislation which would provide for the registration and
    enforcement of support orders by federal district courts,
    but expressed no opinion on the other features of the pro­
    posal. (Conf. Rept., March 1961, p. 23)           .
                COURT OF VETERANS' ApPEALS

       H.R. 3930, 88th Congress, would establish a Court of
    Veterans' Appeals and prescribe its jurisdiction and func­
    tions. The Conference in March 1963 (Conf. Rept., p.
    18) in considering similar proposals was of the view that
    the question as to whether judicial review of the denial
    of a veteran's claim should be accorded is a matter of
    public policy which is solely within the province of Con­
    gress to· decide, and that· the judiciary· should take no
    position thereon. If, however, Congress should decide to
    grant such review, the Conference believed that review
o
                             74
by a Court of Veterans' Appeals, with local hearings by
commissioners of that Court, would provide a more suit­
able form of review than by the district courts, the courts
of appeals, or the Court of Claims. The Conference, ac­
cordingly, approved the type of review proposed by H.R.
3930, except as to the provisions which would amend 28
U.S.C. 451 and 610 to include the proposed court among
the courts of the United States and which would require
the Director of the Administrative Office to assume cer­
tain responsibility for its administrative affairs. These
latter provisions were specifically disapproved by the
Conference.
                       CIVIL RIGHTS

   The views of the Judicial Conference had been re­
quested on various bills relating to civil rights, including
H.R. 24, H.R. 1985 and H.R. 3139, 88th Congress. The
Committee reported, however, that subsequent to these
requests there were introduced in the Congress S. 1731
and H.R. 7152, which contain the provisions of a com-          ( __)
prehensive civil rights bill transmitted to the Congress
by the President. It was the view of the Committee,
after thorough study, that the volume of civil rights liti­
gation would not be substantially increased under the
proposed legislation, although there will undoubtedly be
additional injunction suits under the public accommoda­
tions sections and that, therefore, the provisions of S.
1731 and H.R. 7152 will not impose an unreasonable
burden on the federal courts or unduly increase the
amount of time now required by the courts to deal with
civil rights cases.
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, approved several technical amendments to those pro­
visions of the bill which would affect the business and
operation of the Federal courts, but did not express any
views upon the general questions of policy involved in the
legislation.

                                                               o

       CODIFICATION OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES CODE

       H.R. 4158, 88th Congress, would revise, codify and
    enact into law, Title 5, U.S.C., entitled "Government Or­
    ganization and PersonneL" While the stated purpose of
    the bill is a codification of existing law without substan­
    tive change, the Committee reported that it had called to
    the attention of the staff of the House Judiciary Commit­
    tee certain provisions in the bill which inadvertently
    change the present law and adversely affect judicial and
    Administrative Office personnel. The Committee was
    authorized to continue its work with the Committees of
    the Judiciary in both Houses of Congress to the end that
    existing law and proper practices with respect to judicial
    and Administrative Office personnel be reflected in the
    codification as finally enacted.
              INTERNATIONAL LEGAL CONFERENCES                       Ii
       S. 2129, 88th Congress, would provide for the partici­

o   pation by the Government of the United States in (1)
    The Hague Conference on Private International Law and
     (2) The International Institute for the Unification of
    Private Law to be held in Rome. The Conference con­
    sidered it appropriate for the United States to join in this
    effort by the nations of the world to draft proposed uni­
    fied laws with respect to subjects of international con­
    cern, and, accordingly, voted to approve the proposed
    legislation.
                   TUCKER ACT AMENDMENT

      The Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and
    House of Representatives had requested the views of the
    Conference on identical bills, S. 1351 and H.R. 6538, 88th
    Congress, which would repeal subsection (d) of 28 U.S.C.
    1346 to permit the district courts to entertain civil actions
    by officers or employees of the United States for pensions
    and for compensation for official services. The Confer­
                            76 

ence, upon recommendation of the Committee, deferred
consideration of the proposals contained in these bills
pending inquiry concerning the views of the Department
of Justice.
      INTERSTATE COMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH

   H.J. Res. 25, 88th Congress, would grant the consent
of Congress to the several states to enter into an inter­
state compact on mental health and would authorize
the District of Columbia participation in such compact.
Mter full consideration the Conference approved the bill.
                    EXPEDITING ACT

   S. 1811 and S. 1892, 88th Congress, would amend the
Expediting Act with respect to the provisions for a three­
judge district court and a direct appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States. The purpose of both bills is
to reduce the number of direct appeals to the United
States Supreme Court in Government antitrust cases.
S. 1811, sponsored by the American Bar Association,          ()
would eliminate government antitrust cases under the
Sherman Act entirely from the provisions of the Expedit­
ing Act, thus leaving such provisions applicable only to
government cases under the Interstate Commerce Act.
S. 1892, sponsored by the Department of Justice, would
restrict direct appeals to the Supreme Court in Govern­
ment antitrust cases to those cases in which a certificate
is filed that a case is of general importance. Under the
provisions of the bill, such a certificate may be filed by
the Attorney General or entered by the district· court,
either on application of a party or upon its own motion.
   It was the view of the Committee that a restriction of
the Expediting Act to antitrust cases certified to be "of
general public importance" was preferable to the elimina­
tion of such appeals altogether, but that the Attorney
General should not have an unqualified right to file such

                                                             o
                                77
    a certificate, when such right is denied to the defendant.
    The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee,
    approved S. 1892 with an amendment eliminating the
    right of the Attorney General to file a certificate without
    first obtaining leave of court. S. 1811, 88th Congress,
    was specifically disapproved.
                     ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

       H.R. 43, 88th Congress, would provide for a United
    States Administrative Court which would have concur­
    rent jurisdiction with administrative agencies of certain
    proceedings now conducted by such agencies and concur­
    rent jurisdiction with the district courts of actions by
    agencies for the collection of monetary penalties or for­
    feitures, proceedings for the temporary impounding of
    mail and proceedings to quash or enforce subpoenas.
    The Committee was of the view that there is no need for
    the proposed legislation and the Conference, accordingly,
    disapproved the bill.
              LIMITATIONS AGAINST TORT CLAIMS

       H.R. 6142, 88th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 2401
    to toll the running of the statute of limitations against
    tort claims of persons under legal disability or beyond
    the seas at the time the claims accrue. The statute now
    provides that a civil action (other than a tort claim)
    brought by a person under legal disability or beyond the
    seas at the time the claim accrues, may be commenced
    within three years after the disability ceases. H.R. 6142
    would provide a tolling period of two years for a civil
    action based on a tort claim. The Committee believed
    that it is appropriate to add to 28 U.S.C. 2401 (b) a toll­
    ing provision in regard to tort claims for the benefit of
    persons under legal disability or beyond the seas, as pro­
    vided for civil actions other than those based on a tort
    claim. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
    ference approved the bill.

  ASSESSMENT OF COSTS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES
   H.R. 7140, 88th Congress, would allow defendants in
suits unsuccessfully brought by the United States to re­
cover certain costs. The bill would make it mandatory
to award to a successful defendant in any suit by the
United States, civil or criminal, not only ordinary costs
taxable under 28 U.S.C. 1920, but also reasonable at­
torneys' fees, fees of expert witnesses and, in the discre­
tion of the court, "any and all other costs, direct or
indirect, which have been occasioned the defendant by
reason of the suit." It was the view of the Committee
that the provisions of the bill go too far in allowing at­
torneys' fees, fees of expert witnesses, and "all other
costs, direct or indirect," and in allowing these costs in
criminal cases, as well as in civil cases. Upon recom­
mendation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved
the bill.

  ADMINISTRATIVE CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES
                                                              ()
   The Judicial Conference in March 1960 (Conf. Rept.,
p. 46) had approved in principle the establishment of a
permanent conference on the procedures of executive de­
partments and administrative agencies in adjudication
and rulemaking. H.R. 7202 and H.R. 7203, 88th Con­
gress, though differing somewhat in the powers to be
conferred upon an Administrative Conference and the
manner in which it is to be constituted, would establish
an Administrative Conference of the United States with
respect to the operations of the Civil Aeronautics Board,
Federal Communications Commission, Federal Power
Commission, Federal Trade Commission, the Interstate
Commerce Commission, and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved in principle the proposal to create an Adminis­
trative Conference but made no recommendation with re-

                                                              u
                             79 

 spect to the detailed provisions of H.R. 7202 and H.R. 7203
 regarding the composition and powers of the Adminis­
 trative Conference and the agencies to be included in it,
.since these are not matters of primary concern to the
 federal judiciary.

     ApPEALS IN PATENT AND TRADEMARK CASES

   S. 1940 and H.R. 7553, 88th Congress, would amend the
Patent and Trademark statutes to eliminate the present
requirement that reasons of appeal in patent and trade­
mark cases must be filed in connection with appeals to the
United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. The
Conference considered the proposals contained in these
bills and directed that they be referred back to the
Committee for further study.
    INTERNATIONAL RULES OF JUDICIAL PROCEDURE

   There was brought to the attention of the Conference
S. 2131, 88th Congress, which is a bill to authorize the
continuance of the work of the Commission and Advisory
Committee on International Rules of Judicial Procedure.
The Conference had previously recommended approval of
the legislation creating the Commission and a similar bill
to authorize the continuance of its work beyond the original
expiration date. Several amendments suggested by the
Commission to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
have already been adopted. The Conference thereupon
approved S. 2131.

     RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
   Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing
Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, presented
to the Conference a report on the activities of the standing
Committee and the Advisory Committees on Rules of
Practice and Procedure. .
                             80 

  Judge Maris reported that the Advisory Committee on
the Criminal Rules in connection with its study of the pro­
visions of Rule 5 (a) , Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
which requires that a person arrested be brought before a
commissioner without unnecessary delay, had considered
the proposal contained in S. 1012, 88th Congress. The bill
seeks to overcome the effect of the decision in the case of
Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, under which con­
fessions obtained during a period of delay longer than
that permitted by Rule 5 (a) are excluded from evidence.
Upon the recommendation of the standing Committee, the
Conference voted to disapprove S. 1012 and similar bills
which seek to abrogate the McNabb-Mallory doctrine.
   The Conference was informed that the Committee had
no definitive proposals to present to the Conference at this
time for changes in the rules of practice and procedure.
Tentative proposals for the amendment of certain of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure have been widely cir­
culated and are now being considered by the bench and bar.
All five advisory committees now under appointment are
actively engaged in the work to which they have been           (   ~')
assigned.

         BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   The Chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy Admin­
istration, Senior Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., reported
that the Committee had met and considered the recom­
mendations contained in the Report of the Director of the
Administrative Office, dated June 19, 1963, relating to the
continuance of referee positions to become vacant by expi­
ration of term, for changes in salaries of referees and for
changes in arrangements. The Committee also considered
the recommendations of the district judges and the circuit
councils of the circuits concerned.
   The Conference considered fully the Committee's report
and the recommendations of the Director, judicial coun­


                                                               o

recommendations, the Conference took the action shown in
the following table relating to changes in salaries of ref­
erees and directed that, unless otherwise shown, this action
become effective on October 1, 1963, or as soon thereafter
as appropriated funds are available:

   The Conference took the following action with regard to
changes in arrangements for existing referee positions
and in regard to the filling of referee positions to become
vacant by expiration of term, and directed that unless oth­
erwise noted, the changes become effective October 1,1963,

                            ApPROPRIATIONS

       The Conference was informed that the appropriation
    for the salaries of referees for the Fiscal Year 1964, as
    passed by the House of Representatives, was $50,000 less
    than the amount of the request. A supplemental request
    in the amount of $136,600 will have to be made to pay cur~
    rent salaries of referees and to cover the cost of the salary
    increases and new referee positions authorized by the Con~
    ference in March 1963, and the salary increases authorized
    at this session of the Conference. Appropriation requests
    for salaries of referees for the fiscal year 1965 will be
    approximately $2,686,600.
       The appropriation for referees' expenses for the fiscal
    year 1964, as passed by the House of Representatives,
    totals $5,250,000, an increase of $352,000 over the appro­
    priation for 1963. In view of the increase in the filing of
    bankrupty cases from 147,780 in 1962 to 155,493 in 1963
    the Conference approved the recommendation of the Com­
    mittee that the appropriation requests for the fiscal year
    1965 include additional estimates of referees' expenses
    of approximately $300,000 for the employment of 60
    additional clerks in referees' offices.

                         LEGISLATION

    The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
 tee, reaffirmed its approval of the proposals contained in
 the following bills pending in the 88th Congress, previously
 approved by the Conference:
    (1) Priority Claims, Liens and Title to Property: H.R.
 394, 88th Congress, would amend Sections 1, 17a, 57j,
 64a ( 5), 67b, 67c, and 70c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
 1, 35(a), 93(j), 104(a) (5), 107(b), 107(c) and 110(c)
relating to priority claims, statutory liens, and title to prop­
erty. The bill would preserve the present position of the
costs of administration and of wages in the distribution
of the assets of a bankrupt, and at the same time, would
enable valid contractual liens such as chattel mortgages,
conditional sales contracts, trust receipts, and the like, to
retain their position ahead of statutory liens on personal
property unaccompanied by possession. Section 2 of the
bill, as introduced, was designed to resolve a conflict in
judicial decisions with regard to the treatment of a debt
owing to the Government as a penalty or forfeiture. This           (
conflict was resolved by the Supreme Court in Simonson v.
Grandquist, 369 U.S. 39 (1962) which held that a tax
penalty is not allowable against the bankrupt estate even
though it was secured by a lien. As passed by the House
of Representatives, Section 2 of H.R. 394 was deleted.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
reaffirmed its approval of H.R. 394 as so amended.
    (2) Dischargeability of Debts: H.R. 5772, 88th Con­
gress, would amend section 2a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11
U.S.C. 11 (a), by adding at the end thereof a new subsec­
tion which would give to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction
to determine the dischargeability or nondischargeability
of provable debts. This bill is similar to H.R. 1047, 88th
Congress, approved by the Conference at its March 1963
session, except that the provisions of H.R. 1047 relating
to the stay of suits by and against bankrupt estates have


                                                                   u
                                  85
       been eliminated as unnecessary. The Conference, upon
       recommendation of the Committee, approved H.R. 5772.
          (3) Claims in Chapter XI Cases: H.R. 1049, 88th
       Congress, would amend various sections of the Bank­
       ruptcy Act and add a new section requiring the filing of
       claims in Chapter XI cases and limiting the time within
       which claims may be filed to the time prescribed by sec­
       tion 57n of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 93 (n). This
      bill passed the House of Representatives on April 22,
       1963.
          (4) Referees' Retirement and Salary Bill: H.R. 2556,
       88th Congress, would amend the Bankruptcy Act and
      the Civil Service Retirement Act, generally, to provide:
          (a) 	Terms of 12 years for full-time referees;
          (b) 	An increase in the maximum salary limitation for
                a full-time referee from $15,000 to $20,000 per
                annum, and for a part-time referee from $7,500
                to $10,000 per annum;
          (c ) A salary for the Chief of the Bankruptcy Division
                of the Administrative Office at an amount which
(~) 	          is not less than the maximum rate of compensa­
               tion of a full-time referee;
          (d) 	 A more liberal retirement annuity for referees,
               in general, comparable to the retirement benefits
               now provided for members of Congress and man­
               datory retirement for referees at age 75 under
               certain conditions.
          (5) Summary Jurisdiction: H.R. 2848, 88th Congress,
      would amend Sections 60b, 67e and 70e, of the Bank­
      ruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 96 (b), 107 (e), and 110 (e), to
      give the bankruptcy court summary jurisdiction in ac­
      tions brought under those sections involving preferences,
      liens and fraudulent transfers, and the trustee's title to
      property.
          (6) Rules of Practice and Procedure: H.R. 2859, 88th
      Congress, would provide for the promulgation of rules of
      practice and procedure under the Bankruptcy Act, by

o
                            86 

the Supreme Court of the United States. This bill passed
the House of Representatives on April 22, 1963.
    The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit-            (
tee, took no action on the following bills which appear to
involve questions of public policy to be determined by the
Congress:
    (1) H.R. 66 to increase the amount of wages entitled
to priority to $1,800 and to provide that pension and
welfare benefits earned by an employee shall have the
same priority as direct wages;
    (2) H.R. 549 and H.R. 710 to amend the Bankruptcy
Act with respect to the priority of debts owed by a bank­
rupt to workmen, servants, clerks and certain salesmen;       <



    (3) H.R. 1052 to amend section 64a(2) of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 104(a) (2), to give priority to
certain wages and commissions;
    (4) H.R. 1784 to increase the amount of wages en­
titled to priority to $2,000, to provide that pension, wel­
fare, and other fringe benefits shall be treated as wages,
and to increase the priority period from 3 months to 12
months with respect to certain wage components;                   ( ,
    (5 ) H.R. 3438 to limit the priority and nondischarge­
ability of taxes in bankruptcy; and
    (6) S. 1295, H.R. 3443 and H.R. 4037 to give priority
to certain wages and commissions.
              RAILROAD REORGANIZATIONS

  S. 1557, 88th Congress, would amend Section 77 of the
Bankruptcy Act relating to the reorganization of rail­
roads. This bill is substantially the same as S. 1624,
87th Congress, which was approved by the Conference
at its session in September 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 65)~
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved S. 1557.




                                                                  (
                                                                          '

                                                                      J

                 AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

        The Conference was informed that the examination of
     statistical reports of closed bankruptcy cases for the de­
     termination of errors in the computation of amounts due
     the referee's salary and expense fund and of overpay­
     ments of compensation to receivers and trustees has
     continued. While no situations were reported with re­
     spect to the personal accountability of referees, the
     Administrative Office had brought to the attention of the
     Committee several cases involving possible monopolies in
     the appointment of trustees and receivers in bankruptcy
     cases. More information concerning these appointments
     is being developed and a report will be made to the
     Committee at its next meeting.
         DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER           XIII
        A subcommittee of the Bankruptcy Committee consist­
      ing of Chief Judge Seybourn H. Lynne and District
     Judges Edward Weinfeld and Wesley E. Brown had pre­
     viously been appointed to study and recommend guide­
     lines for all phases of the administration of Chapter XIII
     cases. On the basis of the study and report of the sub­
     committee, the Committee on Bankruptcy Administra­
     tion presented the following recommendations which
     were approved by the Conference:
        (1) That it is the sense of the Conference that the
     annual compensation of any trustee in Chapter XIII
     cases shall not exceed the maximum compensation of a
     full-time referee in any district.
        (2) That the district judges of each district consider
     the feasibility of reducing the 5 percent charge against
     the debtor to a percentage which will produce compensa­
     tion to a trustee which does not exceed the maximum
     salary of the referee.
        (3) That the judges of the district courts should an­
     nually review trustees' commissions and adjust the per~

o

                            88 

centage to be paid to an amount which will yield for any
one trustee an amount not to exceed the compensation          (

paid to a full-time referee.
   (4) That there should be appointed only one Chapter
XIII trustee in each integral commercial area to be
determined by the judges of the court concerned.
   (5) That Chapter XIII trustees be required to main­
tain standard basic records and that semiannual reports be
submitted to the referees by the trustees and that the
referee submit a report to the judges concerning the
operations of the trustees with a copy to the Adminis­
trative Office.
   (6) That, where the accounts of Chapter XIII trustees
are substantial in amount, an annual audit by an inde':'
pendent accountant should be ordered by the district
court concerned.
   (7) That non-consumable property purchased out of
the expense allowances of the Chapter XIII trustee be
regarded as property of the trustee's office and that title
should pass to a successor trustee. This will require that
property records be maintained and that accountability        ( ~

reports be made to the courts when required.
            DEBTOR'S COUNSELLING SERVICE

   The Conference, upon the suggestion of Judge Hamlin,
deferred consideration of the "debtor's counselling serv­
ice" procedure which has been instituted in at least one
district and authorized further study by the Committee.
                    JOINT PETITIONS

  The Conference approved a proposal to amend the
Bankruptcy Act to permit the filing of joint petitions in
bankruptcy by husband and wife who have one or more
joint obligations and authorized the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Officeto prepare an appropriate amendment
for introduction in Congress.
                                 89 

                  MATTERS UNDER ADVISEMENT
        The Conference was informed that the proposal to
     require reports from the referees concerning matters held
     under advisement for excessively long periods had been
     considered and that the Committee had reached the con­
     clusion that reports of submitted matters should be
     required regularly of all referees. The Conference there­
     upon approved the proposal to require referees in bank­
     ruptcy to submit quarterly reports of matters under
     advisement 60 days or longer to the district courts with
     copies of such reports to the Administrative Office.
         OTHER MATTERS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE
        On motion of Chief Judge Chambers, the Conference
     directed that various proposed amendments to the Bank­
     ruptcy Act recommended by the Judicial Conference of
     the Ninth Circuit be referred to the Bankruptcy
     Committee for study and report to the Conference.
C)     ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
       The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration
     of the Criminal Law, Judge William F. Smith, presented
     the report of the Committee.
                         DENIAL OF BAIL
        H.R. 42, 88th Congress, would grant authority to the
     district courts to deny bail in certain criminal cases
     involving national security. The types of cases enumer­
     ated in the bill,however, include both felonies and mis­
     demeanors and the Committee entertained serious doubt
     as to the constitutionality of those provisions of the bill
     relating to the denial of bail to offenders who are charged
     with nothing more than misdemeanors. It was pointed
     out also that the proposed legislation may affect Rule
     46 (a) (1), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which

o
                            90 

now provides that a person accused of an offense not
punishable by death shall be admitted to bail. The Com­
mittee, therefore, recommended that the Conference take       (
no action on the legislation at this time and that the sub­
ject matter be referred to the Advisory Committee on
Criminal Rules and the Committee on the Administration
of the Criminal Law for joint study and report to the
Conference. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
     UNAUTHORIZED USE OF ApPROPRIATED FUNDS

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, voted to express no view on the proposal contained in
H.R. 903, 88th Congress, to amend 18 U.S.C. 1913 with
respect to the use of appropriated funds by executive de­
partments and agencies for the purpose of influencing a
member of Congress "to favor or oppose, by a vote or
otherwise, any legislation or appropriation by Congress."
            ADMISSIBILITY OF CONFESSIONS

   Judge Smith reported that the Committee had con­
                                                              ()
curred in a recommendation of the standing Committee
on Rules of Practice and Procedure to disapprove S.
1012, 88th Congress, and a similar bill, H.R. 4746, 88th
Congress, relating to the admissibility of a confession
notwithstanding the failure of law enforcement officers
to comply with Rule 5(a), Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure. Conference action disapproving this proposal
is shown above.
             COMMITMENT OF THE INSANE

   S. 447, 88th Congress, would authorize the commit­
ment and confinement of a defendant acquitted in a
United States district court solely on the basis of insan­
ity. The Conference discussed the need for a procedure


                                                              u
                                91
    under which the release of a person following his acquit­
    tal in a United States district court by reason of insanity
    could be avoided and which would provide for the neces­
    sary care and treatment of such person in a suitable
    institution, and directed the Committee to give further
    consideration to this problem. The proposal contained in
    S. 447 was referred to the Committee for further study.
                        RIGHT TO TRIAL

       S. 1801, 88th Congress, is designed to effectuate the
    provision of the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution
    requiring that a defendant in a criminal case be given
    the right to a speedy trial. The bill would authorize the
    dismissal of a criminal case where there has been an un­
    reasonable delay either in presenting a charge to a grand
    jury or in filing an information, or where the accused is
    not brought to trial within a specified period of time.
    The bill would also provide that a person against whom
    there is pending more than one indictment or informa­
    tion shall be brought to trial in the same order in which
    the indictments were returned or the informations filed.
    The Conference discussed the provisions contained in
    S. 1801 and directed that the bill be recommitted for
    further study in the light of the discussions at the
    Conference.
      PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION IN CRIMINAL CASES

        The Conference authorized the Committee on the Ad­
    ministration of the Criminal Law to consider further a
    proposal contained in S. 1802, 88th Congress to make it
    unlawful for an employee of the United States or for any
    defendant or his attorney, or the agent of either, to pub­
    lish information not already properly filed with the
    court, which might affect the outcome of any criminal
    litigation.

            MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­                  (

tee, reaffirmed its approval of the proposal contained in
S. 863, 88th Congress, to amend the Federal Youth
Corrections Act by adding the following new subsection:
    "Sec. 5027.   The provisions of this chapter shall be applicable
    to all persons otherwise eligible, who are convicted of viola­
    tions of any Federal penal law relating to narcotics notwith­
    standing the fact that a mandatory penalty is prescribed for
    any such violation."

      PRESENCE OF THE DEFENDANT AT THE TIME 

                   OF SENTENCE 


   S. 1956 and H.R. 7912 would amend 18 U.S.C.
4208 (b) and (c) to provide that when a defendant is
committed to the custody of the Attorney General for
observation and study, the defendant need not be present
in court when the report is received and action is taken
as to any affirmation or modification of the original sen­
tence, but that in the discretion of the court he may be               ( ... 

returned for such proceedings as may be deemed desir­
able. The Conference was informed that the question of
the interpretation of the language of the present statute
was now before the courts and, accordingly, postponed
consideration of the proposal and referred it to the
Committee for further study.
                  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

  The Bureau of the Budget had requested the views of
the Conference on a draft bill prepared by the Depart­
ment of the Army which would amend 18 U.S.C. 3287 to
provide for the suspension of the statute of limitations
on certain offenses during periods of "national emer­
                                      93 

       gency" formally declared by Congress or the President,
       as well as during time of war. The Conference consid­
       ered the draft bill, particularly the definition of the term
       "national emergency," and directed that the proposal be
       referred to the Committee for further study in
       accordance with the discussions at the Conference.
       REINDICTMENT FOLLOWING DISMISSAL OF A DEFECTIVE
                         INDICTMENT

          S. 1891 and H.R. 7219, 88th Congress, would amend
       18 U.S.C. 3288 and 3289 to provide a uniform period of
       6 months for reindictment following dismissal of a defec­
       tive indictment. At present, the period of reindictment
       is related to the concept of "terms of court" which would
       be abolished by the proposal contained in H.R. 2845, 88th
       Congress, previously approved by the Conference. Upon
       recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
       approved S. 1891 and H.R. 7219.

                       DEFINITION OF A FELONY

          The Committee was authorized to consider a resolution
       of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit recom­
       mending that the definition of a felony contained in
       paragraph 1 of 18 U.S.C. 1 be amended to read as
       follows:
          "Any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term
          exceeding 1 year is a felony: Provided, that when a person is
          convicted of any felony and the sentence imposed by the court
          does not provide for imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year,
          such person shall, for all purposes, after the judgment of con­
          viction shall have become final and after the sentence imposed
          upon him shall have expired, be deemed to have been charged
          with and convicted of a misdemeanor, and such person shall
          not suffer any disability or disqualification which would other­
          wise result from a conviction of a felony."

            MOTIONS TO VACATE SENTENCE

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit-       ('
tee, directed that the various proposals to amend 28
U.S.C. 2255 suggested by Judge Daniel H. Thomas of the
Southern District of Alabama be referred to the Commit­
tee on Habeas Corpus for consideration and report to the
Conference.
COMPENSATION TO COUNSEL ApPOINTED TO REPRESENT
        POOR PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME

   The Conference at its March 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 41) had authorized the Committee to reconsider
S. 63, 88th Congress, and other pending legislation (in­
cluding S. 1057, the proposed Criminal Justice Act of
1963) to provide for the payment of compensation to
counsel representing indigent defendants and to cooper­
ate with representatives of the Attorney General.
   The Conference was informed that at the suggestion
of the Committee Chairman several amendments were           ()'
made to S. 1057 to bring it more into conformity with        ,
the provisions of S. 63 which had been previously ap­
proved by the Conference and that the bill, as amended,
passed the Senate. A similar bill, H.R. 7457, ordered
favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee of the
House of Representatives, would authorize payment of
compensation to counsel appointed to represent indigent
defendants, but would not authorize the appointment of
full-time or part-time public defenders. After consider­
ation of these two bills, the Conference voted to approve
S. 1057 as passed by the Senate.
          ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES

  S. 823, 88th Congress, would provide for the appellate
review of any sentence to a term of imprisonment in ex­
cess of five years on the ground that the sentence, al-


                                                            o
                                95 

    though within lawful limits, is excessive. The Committee
    reported that the proposal contained in this bill, which
    is identical with that contained in S. 2879, 87th Con­
    gress, had, in accordance with the recommendation of the
    Conference at its March 1962 session (Conf. Rept., p.
    22), been made the subject of panel discussions at
    the Judicial Conferences of the Second and Third Cir­
    cuits. These discussions have been helpful and the Com­
    mittee requested that the proposed legislation be placed
    on the programs of other circuit conferences.

    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
      Chief Judge Thomas M. Madden, on behalf of Judge
    Luther W. Youngdahl, Chairman of the Committee on
    the Administration of the Probation System, presented
    the report of the Committee to the Conference.
                    SENTENCING INSTITUTES

(      The Committee submitted to the Conference a detailed
    program for a Sentencing Institute to be held early in
    1964 and a tentative list of supplemental institutes to be
    held regionally throughout the nation in the next few
    years. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
    Conference approved in principle the general format of
    the institute program and such supplemental institutes
    as the Committee may approve. The Conference also
    approved the detailed program, including participants
    and agenda, for the first 1964 institute. It was brought
    to the attention of the Conference, however, that a poten­
    tial conflict existed in the dates proposed for the first
    sentencing institute and for the seminar for newly ap­
    pointed United States district judges being planned by
    the Committee on Pretrial Procedure. The Conference
    accordingly authorized the Committees to make arrange­
    ments for combining the two programs.
                           96
                  CIRCUIT COMMITTEES
   In connection with its work, the Committee recom-        (
mended the appointment in each judicial circuit of a
committee on sentencing institutes and seminars to con­
sist of at least one circuit judge and two judges who are
currently, or have been, district judges, and that the
members of such committees be invited to attend at least
one of the sentencing institutes now being planned. The
Conference voted to so recommend to the Judicial
Councils of the Circuits.
        RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER
   A subcommittee of the Committee on the Administra­
tion of the Probation System had recommended the
establishment of a research and development center in
the field of probation for the following purposes:
   (1) To advance and achieve uniformity in the stand­
ards of probation and parole practice by providing con­
tinuing education for personnel who are engaged in
correction of offenders in the community.                   ()
   (2) To stimulate, coordinate, and conduct research
and experimentation in selection and community treat­
ment of offenders.
   (3) To expedite the goal of corrections professional­
ization through the organization of a body of philosophi­
cal and scientific knowledge from the disciplines of law,
criminology, social work, sociology, psychology, educa­
tion, psychiatry, and related areas.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
ence approved in principle the proposal for a federal
probation and parole research and development center
and authorized the Committee to work toward the
establishment of such a center.

                      PRESENTENCE REPORTS
        The Committee requested and was granted authority
     to study and develop an official format and outline for all
     presentence reports to the end that they not only be uni­
     form in quality and coverage, but also that they serve
     jointly the needs of the courts, the Bureau of Prisons,
     and the Board of Parole.
        The views of the Committee concerning a proposed
     change in Rule 32 ( c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
     Procedure regarding the confidential character of pre­
     sentence reports, as contained in the draft submitted by
     the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules to the Bench
     and Bar in December 1962, were referred to the
     Advisory Committee on the Criminal Rules.
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

        The Conference was informed that the Committee has
     under consideration a project to ascertain the availability
     of data for research into the long-term effects of proba­
()   tion as a method of handling offenders and a proposal to
     develop a statement of the principles of probation and
     parole.
        A proposal relating to a study in depth of the federal
     probation system submitted in a letter of Chief Judge
     David L. Bazelon of the District of Columbia Circuit
     was referred to the Committee on the Administration of
     the Probation System.

                    JUDICIAL STATISTICS
       The Chairman of the Committee on Judicial Statistics,
     Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, presented the report of
     the Committee to the Conference.

          DISPOSITION OF CIVIL CASES PENDING
                     OVER 3 YEARS

   The Committee called to the attention of the Confer­
ence the figures contained in the Annual Report of the
Director of the Administrative Office for the fiscal year
1963 which confirm that there has been a substantial
and continuing progress in the disposition of civil cases
pending more than three years and which indicate that
these cases are being made the subject of a programmed
effort. What has been accomplished, though not spectac­
ular, does reflect an attitude and application which is of
special significance in judicial administration. The
Committee also pointed out the special effort and cooper­
ation of the Lands Division of the Department of Justice
in reducing the total number of tracts involved in pend­
ing Government land condemnation cases from approxi­
mately 32,000 in 1961 to less than 22,000 at the end of
the fiscal year 1963.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee the Confer­
ence adopted the following resolution:
    The Conference takes note of the efforts made by the District
    Courts, since the resolutions of the Conference in September
    1961 and March 1963, to dispose of the cases 3 years or more
    old on their dockets, and also of the cooperation which the
    Lands Division of the Department of Justice has been giving
    in accelerating the termination of the condemnation cases
    which are pending.
  The Conference was informed that a list of civil cases
pending more than three years as of the end of the fiscal
year 1963 as to each of the districts in a circuit is being
sent by the Administrative Office to the chief judge of
such circuit for transmittal by him to the chief judges
of the respective district courts.
                 ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  The Committee reported that it had considered a rec­
ommendation for the creation of an additional judgeship

                                                                    o
                            99 

in the Eastern District of Virginia and for additional
judgeships in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
Conference action with respect to these proposals is
shown under the report of the Committee on Court
Administration.
                   STATISTICAL TABLES

   A substantial amount of the time of the Committee
has been spent in reviewing statistical practices, tables,
and reports and in giving consideration to suggested
changes and improvements therein. In so doing, the
Committee has considered and approved various propos·
als made by the Division of Procedural Studies and
Statistics of the Administrative Office for:
   (1) Changes in jury reports on Form J.S. 11;
   (2) Revision of the instructions for statistical report­
ing by clerks of courts of appeals;
   (3) The form of a directive to the clerks of the dis·
trict courts as to docketing procedures for motions under
28 U.S.C. 2255;
   (4) The use of forms to report appointments of
counsel made by courts of appeals;
   (5) Making a special analytical report with detailed
information concerning persons under probation super­
vision; and
   (6) Preparing a sep'arate annual report on criminal
offenses processed in the district courts.
   The Conference was informed that when any matters
arise in any area where the Committee regards it as
necessary or desirable to have Conference approval or
expression for policy purposes, they will be made the
subject of report by the Committee.

              PRETRIAL PROCEDURE
  The Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure,
Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, presented the report
of the Committee.
                             100 

                   PRETRIAL EXAMINERS

   The Conference, as reported above, authorized the
Committees on Pretrial Procedure and Court Adminis­
tration to consider further the survey reports on the
pretrial examiner systems in the District of Columbia
and in the Southern District of New York.
       PRETRIAL PROCEDURE IN CRIMINAL CASES

   Judge Murrah informed the Conference that the Com­
mittee had considered and approved the preliminary
draft of the proposed new Rule 17A, Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, relating to the use of pretrial con­
ference procedures in criminal cases, as drafted by the
Advisory Committee on the Criminal Rules. In view of
the increasing number of protracted criminal trials and
of the need to develop procedures designed to expedite the
disposition of all criminal cases in a manner consistent
with the constitutional rights of a defendant, the Com­
mittee felt that a complete, thoroughgoing study of the
use of pretrial procedure in criminal cases should be              (/
undertaken. The Committee was further of the view
that the program for such a study should be worked out
with representatives of the Department of Justice and
should include meetings or seminar type sessions of
judges, government attorneys, and representatives of the
Bar generally who are thoroughly familiar with proce­
dures in a criminal case. Upon recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference adopted the following
resolution:
   That the Committee on Pretrial Procedure is authorized to
   make a study of special problems involved in the pretrial of
   all criminal cases, the study to be under the auspices of the
   Pretrial Committee and in conference with representatives
   of the Department of Justice and with leading trial counsel
   conversant with procedural problems in criminal cases; and
   further, that the Committee is authorized to conduct, at ap­
                              101 

    propriate times and places, meetings or seminars of judges
    and lawyers for the purpose of developing useful administra­
    tive techniques for the pretrial of criminal cases.

             CIRCUIT JUDICIAL CONFERENCES

   The Committee suggested that a portion of the annual
judicial conference of each circuit be set aside for a dis­
cussion of problems relating to judicial administration,
discovery, pretrial procedure and calendar controL This
would be a logical extension of the seminar type pro­
grams conducted for newly appointed United States dis­
trict judges. The Conference was informed that the
Committee is prepared, through the member of the Pre­
trial Committee in each circuit, to assist the chairman of
each circuit conference program committee in preparing
such a program and obtaining speakers.
         SEMINAR FOR NEW DIS'l'RICT JUDGES

   The Conference was informed that the seminar for
new district judges planned to be held at Denver, Colo­
rado, last July was postponed by the Committee. Ap­
pointments to existing judgeship vacancies on the district
courts were not made as rapidly as had been expected,
and the Committee was of the view that the seminar
ought not to be held unless a sufficient number of new
district judges were in attendance. The Committee is
now working with the Committee on the Administration
of the Probation System on a combined sentencing insti­
tute and seminar session to be held early in February
1964.
  The Committee reported that an account of the pro­
ceedings of the seminars for new district judges, con­
ducted during 1962, has been printed by the West
Publishing Company and that a copy is being made
available to every federal judge.
                           102
       SUBCOMMITTEE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION

   The subcommittee of the Pretrial Committee appointed
to consider discovery problems arising in multiple litiga­
tion with common witnesses and exhibits submitted a
progress report on the conduct of the program for the
trial and disposition of the antitrust treble-damage ac­
tions which arose out of the criminal antitrust proceed­
ings in the electrical equipment industry in Philadelphia
in 1961. Through the efforts of the subcommittee, 20
separate pretrial orders, national in scope, have been
prepared and entered in every case with some local vari­
ations; the third round of a national deposition program
is virtually complete; a national depository containing
more than 600,000 documents produced by defendants
has been established in Chicago and a similar depository
for documents of the plaintiffs is being planned; and
several legal decisions have been made by the courts on
issues basic to the litigation. It is expected that a
number of these cases will soon be scheduled for trial.
                 COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

   The Conference was informed that the Committee on
Pretrial Procedure plans a complete study and re-exami­
nation of Rule 16, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in
the light of experience and current practices in regard to
pretrial procedure. The Committee further plans to
study the use of pretrial procedure in the processing of
habeas corpus petitions and motions to vacate sentence
brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255 and of the use of pretrial
procedure in land condemnation cases.
  The report of the Committee was received and
approved by the Conference.

        INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
         The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Inter­
     circuit Assignments, Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported
     on the processing of requests for intercircuit assign­
     ments. Since its last report, the Committee has recom­
     mended favorably on 18 intercircuit assignments and no
     adverse recommendation has been made. The judges
     receiving assignments during this period include three
     circuit judges, two senior circuit judges, six district
     judges, three senior district judges and one senior judge
     of a special court. Except for the assignment of senior
     judges, all assignments recommended by the Committee
     during the period covered by the report related either to
     the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit or to the pro­
     gram with respect to the multiple antitrust cases in the
     electrical equipment industry.
        The Committee reported that despite vigorous efforts
     of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to keep up
     with its docket and despite the help which has been given,
(    docket congestion continues and the prospects are that
     out-of-circuit assistance will continue to be needed.
         The Advisory Committee indicated that the electrical
     equipment antitrust cases pose a special problem in the
     assignment of judges which was not covered by the state­
     ment of principles adopted by the Conference at its
     March 1963 session (Conf. Rept., p. 36). As previously
     authorized by the Conference, the subcommittee of the
     Committee on Pretrial Procedure concerned with multiple
     litigation has been dealing with the problems arising out
     of these cases. Because of the national scope of deposi­
     tions and their importance to the disposition of the cases
     pending throughout the nation, the depositions are being
     taken before a judge. The specialized character of the
     evidence is such that the taking of the depositions must
     be under the supervision and control of a judge who is
     thoroughly familiar with the litigation. The Committee

(J
                                 104
has thus recommended assignments for this purpose be­
cause it was of the view that the expeditious handling of                if"~
these cases is of prime importance to the administration
of justice. The Committee indicated that additional
assignments in the electrical equipment cases may be
expected.
  Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference 

added the following paragraph to the policy statement 

approved in ~arch 1963: 

    In extraordinary situations concerning related cases pending
    in multiple districts the principles and procedures adopted by
    the Conference on March 11, 1963, shall not control and the
    Advisory Committee on Intercircuit Assignments in making
    its recommendations to the Chief Justice shall give considera­
    tion to the over-all need of, and benefit to, the federal judicial
    system.
  The report of the Committee, including a statement
relating to the need for intercircuit assistance and the
availability of judges for such service, was received and
approved by the Conference.

              SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
                                                                         (
   The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Per­
sonnel, Chief Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report
of the Committee to the Conference.
                      COURT REPORTERS

   The Conference was informed that the Committee had
considered jointly with the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration various matters pertaining to the court reporting
system and had concurred in the recommendations of the
Committee on Court Administration, presented above.
   The Committee also considered several requests that
provision be made for sick leave for court reporters. At
present a court reporter who is absent from duty must
either be placed on leave without pay, if a substitute
                                 105
      reporter is to be employed at Government expense, or he
      must provide a substitute to be paid by the reporter.
      The Committee was of the view that some equitable plan
     should be devised whereby, within reasonable limits, sub­
      stitute court reporters may be provided at Government
      expense for court reporters who become ill or disabled.
      The Committee, therefore, recommended that the Direc­
     tor of the Administrative Office, subject to the availabil­
      ity of funds, be authorized and directed to approve the
     employment of temporary court reporters and their com­
      pensation, at prevailing local per diem rates, from ju­
     diciary appropriations when such temporary employment
     is necessary because of the bona fide illness of a court
     reporter. The Committee further recommended that these
     temporary appointments be made within the limitations
     and under the rules and regulations to be promulgated
     by the Director of the Administrative Office, and that a
     showing of a bona fide illness should include a certifica­
     tion by the chief judge or single judge of the court
     involved that the services of such a temporary reporter
(	   on the day specified were or are needed for the prompt
     and proper transaction of judicial business and that
     other regular reporters of the court were or are not
     available to perform the duties of the reporter who is
     ill. These recommendations were approved by the
     Conference.
         The Conference at its March 1963 session had author­
     ized the Committee to consider the suggestion that the
     two categories of court reporter positions be combined.
     The Committee was of the view that the distinction be­
     tween "metropolitan" and "nonmetropolitan" court re­
     porters has become artificial since there is no way of
     evaluating with particularity the benefits accruing to and
     the working conditions of a court reporter in a large
     court as contrasted with the same considerations affect­
     ing a court reporter attached to a small court. The
     Conference thereupon approved the recommendation of

(J
                              106 

the Committee that, subject to the availability of funds,
the nonmetropolitan category of court reporters be elimi-
nated and that all court reporters be placed in the salary
                                                                   r".
rate applicable to reporters in the present metropolitan
category.
   The Conference was informed that the Committee had
decided to make a direct inquiry of each reporter for
information concerning the over-all problems of the fed­
eral court reporter system. The request will be in the
form of a letter from the Chairman summarizing the
various proposals which have reached the Committee,
including those contained in the study of the court re­
porter system by Messrs. Parker and Tharp. A report
on the results of this inquiry and study will be made at
the next session of the Conference.
               COURT REPORTER-SECRETARY
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, approved the creation of a combination position of
court reporter-secretary in the District of Guam at a              C/'
salary of $8,310 per annum.
   The Committee requested and was granted leave to
consider further the requests of the judges in the District
of North Dakota and the District of the Canal Zone to
increase the salaries for the positions of court reporter­
secretary in these districts.
                     CLERKS OF COURT
   The Judicial Council of the Second Circuit has sug­
gested a separate salary classification for the clerks "of
each of the large sized United States Courts of Appeals."
The Conference was informed that the Committee would
give consideration to this request, but has postponed
action until such time as the Judiciary Salary Plan for
the offices of the clerks of the district courts, the offices of
the referees, and the probation offices has been fully
funded and applied.
                                                                   c
                                  107
        The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
     tee, disapproved the request of the United States Court
     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for au­
     thority to re-employ the retired clerk of that court as a
     consultant to assist the court with matters pertaining to
     Judicial Council meetings and matters pertaining to the
     Circuit Judicial Conference.
        The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had re­
     quested an increase in the grade of the senior deputy
     clerk from GS-IO to GS-ll as an exception to the salary
     plan for clerks' offices of courts of appeals. It was
     pointed out that the court has widely separated places
     for holding court and an unusually heavy caseload which
     require the delegation of authority and responsibility to
     the senior deputy clerk. The Committee views the spe­
     cial problem in this court as unprecedented and unique
     and, without suggesting or recommending any change in
     the over-all plan, recommended an increase in the grade
     of this position from GS-IO to GS-l1. This recom­
     mendation was approved by the Conference.
('
               ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

        The Committee reported that it had considered nu­
     merous requests for additional permanent positions in
     the offices of the clerks of the courts of appeals and dis­
     trict courts and in the probation offices and offices of the
     referees in bankruptcy_ The Conference, upon recom­
     mendation of the Committee, took the following action
     with respect to these requests:
        (1) Deferred consideration of all requests for addi­
     tional positions in the offices of the clerks of the district
     courts pending a possible reduction in workload through
     the installation of a central disbursing system in tlie
     Administrative Office and through the introduction of
     modern equipment and procedures in these offices. Tem­
     porary assistance in emergency situations is available
     and is being provided.
(
                            108
    (2) Authorized the inclusion in the appropriation re­
quests for the fiscal year 1965 of sufficient funds for at
least fifteen permanent deputy clerk positions in the
courts of appeals. These positions are needed because
                                                               r
of the increased workload in the courts of appeals result­
ing from the impact of the new judgeships recently
authorized for these courts.
    (3) Authorized the inclusion in the appropriation re­
quests for the fiscal year 1965 of sufficient funds for the
full number of additional officer and clerical positions
for the probation system requested by the various courts
and found to be justified by the Administrative Office.
    (4) Authorized the inclusion in the appropriation re­
quests for the fiscal year 1965 of sufficient funds for
fifty to sixty additional clerical positions, on a temporary
basis, in the offices of the referees in bankruptcy. These
positions will be needed if the increase in the filing of
bankruptcy cases, amounting to more than 5,000 cases
during the last 6 months of the fiscal year 1963, should
continue.
       SALARIES OF CLERKS OF DISTRICT COURTS

   The Committee had considered a request that the sal­
ary classification of the clerk of the United States Dis­
trict Court for the Western District of Texas be increased
to the highest category for clerks of district courts and
after a thorough study, recommended that the request be
disapproved. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
                   HABEAS CORPUS
  Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Com­
mittee on Habeas Corpus, presented to the Conference a
comprehensive Committee report detailing the history of
proposed legislation with respect to habeas corpus appli­
cations in the district courts by persons in custody pur­
suant to the judgment of a state court. The Committee
                               109 

    recommended that the Conference reaffirm its approval
    of the bill previously recommended by the Committee
    with two amendments. The Conference also considered
    a proposal to amend the section of the proposed bill with
    respect to the procedure before a three-judge district
    court.
       After full discussion the Conference voted to reaffirm
    its approval of the bill with the three amendments dis­
    cussed at the Conference and instructed the Director of
    the Administrative Office to send the draft bill, as modi­
    fied by the Conference, to the Chairman of the Judiciary
    Committees of both Houses of Congress recommending
    that the bill be enacted into law. The draft bill, as
    amended, will be sent to the judges of the Courts of
    Appeals and District Courts for their information.

             PROCEDURE IN HABEAS CORPUS CASES

       The Committee called attention to local rule 23 of the
    United States District Court for the Northern District
(   of Illinois, which sets forth in some detail the procedure
    to be followed by a petitioner in a habeas corpus pro­
    ceeding or in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. 2255 to vacate
    sentence. It was the view of the Committee that this
    type of procedure affords a constructive approach toward
    the disposition of habeas corpus petitions not only more
    expeditiously, but also upon a sounder factual basis, and
    would greatly aid the habeas corpus judge in making the
    preliminary inquiry provided for in the draft habeas
    corpus bill sponsored by the Conference.
       Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
    ence directed that a copy of the rule, forms and instruc­
    tions in use in the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of Illinois, together with a copy of the
    appropriate section of the Committee report, be brought
    to the attention of the judges of the several district
    courts. The Conference further recommended that the
                           110 

judges consider the adoption of a like rule, forms and
instructions in their respective districts.

        UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS
                                                            r

the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit concerning
an increase in fees payable to United States Commis­
sioners was referred to the Committee on the Adminis­
tration of the Criminal Law for study and report to the
Conference.
                    COMMITTEES
  On motion of Chief Judge Matthew F. McGuire, the
Conference directed that the Committee on the Operation
of the Jury System be continued as a separate standing
Committee of the Conference.

      PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE
            COURTS OF APPEALS
  At the request of Chief Judge Simon E. Sobeloff, the
Conference, pursuant to 28 U .S.C. 48, consented to the
pretermission of the term of the Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit, scheduled to be held at Baltimore in
November 1963.

      RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION

action on matters considered at this session, where
necessary for legislative or administrative action.
