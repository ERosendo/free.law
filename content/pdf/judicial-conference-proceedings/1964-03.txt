dicial circuit to a conference at such time and place in the United States as he
may designate. He shall preside at such conference which shall be known as the
Judicial Conference of the United States. Special sessions of the conference
may be called by the Chief Justice at such times and places as he may designate.
   The district judge to be summoned from each judicial circuit shall be chosen
by the circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual judicial conference
of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 of this title and shall serve as a
member of the conference for three successive years, except that in the year
following the enactment of this amended section the judges in the first, fourth,
seventh, and tenth circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for one year,
the judges in the second, fifth, and eighth circuits shall choose a district judge
to serve for two years and the judges in the third, sixth, ninth and District of
Columbia circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for three years.
   If the chief judge of any circuit or the district judge chosen by the judges of
the circuit is unable to attend, the Chief Justice may summon any other circuit

remain throughout the sessions of the conference and advise as to the needs
of his circuit or court and as to any matters in respect of which the adminis­
tration of justice in the courts of the United States may be improved.
   The conference shall make a comprehensive survey of the condition of business
in the courts of the United States and prepare plans for assignment of judges to
or from circuits or districts where necessary, and shall submit suggestions to
the various courts, in the interest of uniformity and expedition of business.
   The Conference shall also carryon a continuous study of the operation and
effect of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as
prescribed by the Supreme Court for the other courts of the United States
pursuant to law. Such changes in and additions to those rules as the Conference
may deem desirable to promote simplicity in procedure, fairness in administra­
tion, the just determination of litigation, and the elimination of unjustifiable
expense and delay shall be recommended by the Conference from time to time to
the Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modification or rejection,
in accordance with law.
   The Attorney General shall, upon request of the Chief Justice, report to such
conference on matters relating to the business of the several courts of the
United States, with particular reference to cases to which the United States
is a party.
   The Chief Justice shall submit to Congress an annual report of the proceedings
of the Judicial Conference and its recommendations for legislation.

   The Conference noted the death of Circuit Judges
Sam G. Bratton, Charles E. Clark, and Charles C. Simons,
all former members of the Conference, and the death of
Circuit Judge John B. Sanborn, who was closely associated
with the work of the Conference, and adopted the follow­
ing resolutions:

              HONORABLE SAM      G.   BRATTON

   The Conference notes with sorrow the death of Circuit
Judge Sam G. Bratton, a former distinguished member of
this body. Judge Bratton's brilliant career as a circuit
judge in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth
                                       8


        Judicial Circuit spanned more than thirty years. Prior to
        that time he was a representative of his state of New
(   ,
        Mexico in the United States Senate. As a member of this
        Conference for more than three years, Judge Bratton con­
        tributed not only his legal talent and skill to the delibera­
        tions of the Conference, but also his lively wit and unfail­
        ing humor. He will long be remembered by his colleagues
        in the Tenth Circuit and by the members of this Conference.
                      HONORABLE CHARLES      E. CLARK
           The Conference notes with sorrow the passing of Circuit
        Judge Charles E. Clark on December 13,1963. He was one
        of the principal architects of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
        and, as teacher and judge, he was a leader for procedural
        reform, serving actively as a member of the Conference
        Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure at the time
        of his death.. The Conference remembers and is grateful
        for Judge Clark's services as a member of the Conference,
        when Chief Judge of the Second Circuit, and of its com­
        mittees over the past quarter century, and for the un­
        stinted devotion of his great knowledge, skill and zeal to
        the improvement of the administration of justice in this
        country.
                     HONORABLE CHARLES C. SIMONS
          Chief J udge Weick, of the Sixth Circuit, advised the
        Conference of the death on February 2, 1964, of Charles C.
        Simons, Senior Judge of the United States Court of
        Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; and the Conference di­
        rected the following statement by Chief Judge Weick to
        be included in the minutes of the Conference:
            Judge Simons was born in the City of Detroit of immigrant
          parents on May 21, 1876. He received his Bachelor of Philos­
          ophy degree from the University of Michigan and graduated
          from its law school with honors in 1900. He was a member of
          the Michigan Senate from 1908 to 1904 and refused to stand
          for the election for another term but was elected a member
                                4

   of the Michigan Constitutional Convention in 1908 and was
 . a Presidential elector at large in 1916.                           ('/'
     He received honorary degrees from his alma mater, the 

   University of Michigan; Wayne State University; and Detroit 

   College of Law. He was appointed United States District 

   Judge in 1923 and served until he ascended to the bench of 

   the United States Court of Appeals in 1932. For six years 

   he was Chief Judge of that court and in that capacity served 

   as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States. 

     He taught law and maintained a keen interest in advanc­

   ing legal education. He had a constant awareness of the needs 

   of the City of Detroit, where he was born, as well as of the 

   total American community. He led many to a better life. 

   The Conference resolved to express its profound regret
at the death of this distinguished member of the federal
judiciary and ordered a copy of this statement and resolu­
tion be sent to the Clerk of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and to the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

               HONORABLE JOHN B. SANBORN
   RESOLVED: That the Judicial Conference takes note,                (J'
with sorrow, of the death of Senior Circuit Judge John B.
Sanborn of the Eighth Circuit on March 7, 1964, and ex­
presses its appreciation of his 39 years of distinguished
service on the federal bench, both district and circuit, and
of his valuable contribution as a member of a number of
the Committees of this Conference.

               REPORT OF 

   THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE 

   OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS 

  Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office
of the United States Courts, brought to the attention of
the Conferehce various problems that will be presented if,

          should be enacted. The Conference discussed various as­
(         pects of the problem of administering a system of com­
          pensating assigned. counsel and in particular the .recom­
          mendations of a Special Committee of the Association of
          the Bar of the City of New York and the National Legal
          Aid and Defender Association. These re.commendations
          with respect to an assigned counsel system are:
           "1. Using rotation to assign qualified counsel;
            2. 	 Centralizing assignment in a single administrative
                 unit;
            3. 	 Having indigency determined by someone other
                 than the assigned counsel;                  . .
            4. 	 Providing for the reimbursement of assigned coun-'
                 sel for all expenses incurred; and.
            5. 	 Compensating counsel ad~quately,"
            The Conference suggested that'the quoted recommenda-·
         tions be brought to the attention of all circuit conferences
         and recommended the appointment of a committee in each
         judicial circuit to consider the various problems of com­
         pensating appointed counsel. The Conference also author­
    (	   ized the appointment of an ad hoc committee of the
         Conference to work with the Administrative Office in
         developing rules, procedures and guidelines for an as­
         signed counsel system.
            The Director also called attention to the provisions of
         the pending legislation which would require the appoint­
         ment of counsel for the indigent upon appearance before a
         United States commissioner and suggested that this would
         make necessary a complete survey of the United States
         commissioner system. The Conference thereupon author­
         ized the appointment of an ad hoc committee to study the
         feasibility of establishing a system of full-time, salaried
         United States commissioners with expanded jurisdiction,
         who might be empowered to try certain misdemeanors and
         accept waivers of indictment, ,and be authorized to con­
         duct full preliminary hearings and enter' appropriate
         holding' orders.

             JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
   The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief
Judge William J. Campbell, reported that hearings before
the Appropriations Subcommittee of the House of
Representatives on the appropriation requests for the fis­
cal year 1965 had been held, but that no report by the
Appropriations Committee had as yet been issued. With
respect to the current fiscal year 1964, the appropriations
appear adequate except for a request for a small supple­
mental appropriation 'for salaries of referees in bank­
ruptcy and the possibility of the need for a small supple­
mental appropriation for fees of jurors. Chief· Judge
Campbell informed the Conference that the Spring meet­
ing of the Budget Committee had been held in San
Francisco in accordance with the plan of the Committee to
hold its Spring meeting in various circuits so that the
Committee may accumulate at first hand information on
the budget needs of the courts in the various circuits and
the justifications for them.
  Chief Judge Campbell called attention to the experiment
in the use of pretrial examiners being conducted in the
Southern District of New York and suggested the need
for the Conference to determine the results of the experi­
ment and whether or not to continue the request for the
funds for the fiscal year 1966.
              COURT ADMINISTRATION
   The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administra­
tion, Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the report of
the Committee.
              SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES .
  The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 63) had authorized the Committee to give fur­
ther consideration to the proposals contained in S. 1367,
88th Congress, relating to (1) the selection of chief judges

                                                               ()
                                   7

    of the circuits and of the multiple-judge district courts;
     (2) the terms of service of chief judges; and ( 3) the
(   powers and responsibilities of chief judges with respect to
    the general administrative superintendence of the busi­
    ness of the circuit and district courts. The Committee re­
    ported that it had considered the proposals contained in
    this bill and various other plans for the selection of chief
    judges of the circuits and of multiple-judge district courts,
    but had been unable to arrive at any conclusion as to the
    best method for the selection of chief judges. The Commit­
    tee accordingly requested and was granted leave to con­
    sider further the proposals contained in S. 1367 and other
    plans for the selection of chief judges and to report at a
    later session of the Conference.

               AMENDMENT      OF   28 U.S.C.372(b)
       The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
    Rept., p. 63) had directed the Committee to give further
    consideration to the proposal contained in S. 1368, 88th
    Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 372(b) to provide for the
    appointment of an additional judge in a court where a
    judge has served 10 years and has reached the age of 70
    and the judicial council of the circuit has recommended
    the appointment of an additional judge. The bill would
    also provide that whenever a judge is so appointed, the
    vacancy subsequently caused by the death, resignation, or
    retirement of the judge by reason of whose failure to re­
    sign or retire from regular active service such appoint­
    ment was made, shall not be filled. Similar provisions with
    respect to the Court of Claims, the Court of Customs and
    Patent Appeals and the Customs Court are also contained
    in the bill.
       The Conference discussed the proposed legislation and
    various amendments thereto recommended by the Commit­
    tee and directed that the bill be referred to the Committee
    for further study.

         ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS AND DIVISIONS
   After a full discussion of the various bills to create new
districts and divisions in California, including H.R. 6655,
                                                               n
H.R. 6821, H.R. 4834 and H.R. 9567, 88th Congress, the
Conference voted to authorize the Director of the Admini­
strative Office to inform the Chairman of the House Judi­
ciary Committee that while the Judicial Conference has
for many years opposed the creation of additional judicial
districts, it recognizes that California has a unique prob­
lem because of the large geographic area it embraces and
its rapidly expanding population and continuing economic
development. The Conference was of the opinion therefore
that it cannot adhere in this case to the policy it has con­
sistently followed but felt that it could not at this time
take a position as to any pending bill because of insuffi­
cient information on the subject. However, the Conference
instructed the Director of the Administrative Office to
make available to the Congress, on request, any statistical
information which it has on the subject. The Committee
on Court Administration was authorized to give further ('\
consideration to the proposals.                               ~J,

                 ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS
   H.R. 8898, 88th Congress, would provide for the crea­
tion of an additional judgeship for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference voted to withhold any recommendation on
H.R. 8898 pending a study of trends in the caseload and
of the availability of judicial manpower within the next
few months.
               PLACES OF HOLDING COURT
   S. 2392, 88th Congress, would add Williston as an addi.
tional place of holding court for the United States Dis­
trict Court for the District of North Dakota. The Con­
ference was informed that the Judicial Council of the
                                     9

    Eighth Circuit disapproves of holding court at Williston
(   because of the small percentage of cases which would be
    available for trial there. Upon recommendation of the
    Committee, the Conference voted to disapprove the bill.
       Consideration of the proposal contained in H.R. 9929,
    88th Congress, to add Manchester as a place of holding
    court in the Winchester Division of the United States
    District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee "on a
    temporary basis upon order of the presiding judge" was
    deferred by the Conference pending action by the Judicial
    Council of the Sixth Circuit.
       H.R. 8561, 88th Congress, would add Clinton as an
    additional place of holding court in the Eastern District
    of North Carolina. The Conference was informed that the
    proposal contained in the bill had been approved by the
    Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit. Upon recommenda­
    tion of the Committee, the Conference voted to approve
    the bill.
                       RETIREMENT OF JUDGES

       The Conference in September 1963 (Conf. Rept., p. 64)
    had referred to the Committee for study a draft resolution
    which would provide that henceforth it shall be the policy
    of the Judicial Conference not to recommend to the
    Congress an additional judgeship in any district or circuit
    wherein there is a judge or judges who are eligible to re­
    tire or accept senior status but decline to do so. The Con­
    ference considered the draft resolution and the recom­
    mendation of the Committee that it be disapproved. After
    full discussion the Conference adopted the following
    resolution:
         RESOLVED: That the Committee on Court Administration
      is requested to undertake a comprehensive survey and study
      of the problems arising in the expeditious disposition of the
      judicial business of a United States court (other than the
      Supreme Court) where a judicial officer becomes unable to
      discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of
                                10

  permanent mental or physical disability. The Committee is 

  further requested to undertake a similar comprehensive sur­ 

  vey and study of the problems arising in the administration 

  of justice in a United States court (other than the Supreme 

  Court) where a judicial officer is guilty of misbehavior in 

  office. The Committee is also requested to review the adequacy 

  of existing statutory and administrative procedures relating 

  to these problems and to formulate and recommend to the 

  Conference improvements in these procedures. 


                    PRETRIAL EXAMINERS
   Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the
Committee was not yet ready to report on the use of pre­
trial examiners as a part of pretrial procedure in the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia
and in the District Court for the Southern District of New
York and requested leave to report at the next Conference
session. The Conference considered the need for a first
hand study of the pretrial examiner program by a small
committee of judges and after full discussion adopted the
following resolution:
    RESOLVED:    That two district judges and one circuit judge, 
   ()
  to be designated by the Committee on Court Administration, 

  examine the administration of the respective pretrial exam­

  iner systems of the United States District Courts for the 

  District of Columbia and for the Southern District of New 

  York and report thereon to the Committee on Pretrial Proce­

  dure and to the Committee on Court Administration. 


           DISBURSEMENT OF JUDICIARY FUNDS
   The Director of the Administrative Office had submitted
to the Committee a study of the feasibility of disbursing
judiciary appropriations exclusively from the Administra­
tive Office of the United States Courts. The Committee
had been informed that a test of such a system with pilot
projects in three different courts had disclosed no weak­
nesses and that the Administrative Office is satisfied that
the plan is entirely practical. Upon recommendation of the

                                                                      (j
                                      11

        Committee, the Conference approved the study demon­
(       strating the feasibility of the system.
                        PUBLICATION OF OPINIONS
           Chief Judge Biggs reported that the subcommittee ap­
        pointed to consider ways and means of limiting the publi­
        cation of opinions had collected data on this subject from
        chief judges of the circuits, circuit and district judges,
        and various other sources including data supplied by offi­
        cials of the State of New York, and had reported thereon
        to the full Committee. In view of the rapidly growing
        number of published opinions of the courts of appeals and
        of the district courts of the United States, and the ever
        increasing practical difficulty and economic cost of estab­
        lishing and maintaining accessible private and public law
        library facilities, the Committee presented the following
        resolution which was approved by the Conference:
            RESOLVED: That the judges of the courts of appeals and
          the district courts authorize the publication of only those
          opinions which are of general precedential value and that
    (     opinions authorized to be published be succinct.

                               CLERKS' FEES
          The Conference was informed that the study and report
        on the existing fee schedule for the clerks of court, pre­
        pared by the Administrative Office, had been referred to a
        subcommittee to consider the extent to which fee schedules
        should be commensurate with the services rendered. The
        Committee therefore requested and was granted leave to
        report at a later session of the Conference.

                   COSTS OF PRINTING AND OF BOOKS
          The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
        Rept., p. 59) directed the Committee to consider and make
        recommendations concerning the alarmi ng increase in
        printing costs and the costs of the acquisition of law books.

(
                             12

Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the
Administrative Office had undertaken to examine these           (,J
costs and that a subcommittee had been appointed to con­
sider what savings can be made in the purchase of law
books. The Committee was thereupon authorized to con­
sider these matters further and to report at a later session
of the Conference.
                COURTROOM PHOTOGRAPHS
   The Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit had re­
quested an amendment to the Judicial Conference resolu­
tion on the taking of photographs within the environs of a
courtroom to permit "news media courtroom photography
or telecasting of naturalization or ceremonial judicial
matters had in accordance with local rule of court." Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference dis­
approved the proposed amendment.
        EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ACT
   The Conference was informed that the Senate Commit­         ()
tee on Labor and Public Welfare had requested the views
of the judiciary on the judicial review provisions of
S. 1937, 88th Congress, which is the proposed "Equal
Employment Opportunity Act." This bill provides, in gen­                 i


eral, for the review of the orders of an Equal Employment                j
Opportunity Board by the courts of appeals. The bill fur­
ther provides that on application a case may be trans­
                                                                     1
                                                                         i
ferred from the court of appeals to a local district court
which would then have jurisdiction to consider and dispose               1
of the proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the
bill. The district court's decree would be final except for
review by the court of appeals. This procedure would be                  iI
followed for cases arising in areas so distant from places
                                                                         I
where the court of appeals sits as to impose substantial
hardship on a party other than the Administrator or the
Board. The judicial council of the circuit would be em-                  I

        powered to designate "hardship areas." While these pro­
        visions are unusual, it was the view of the Committee that
        they are desirable and feasible. Upon recommendation of
        the Committee, the Conference approved the provisions of
        S. 1937 relating to the judicial review and enforcement of
        orders of the Board.

                 JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT
                     AND THE COURTS OF ApPEALS

           S. 1683, 88th Congress, would limit the jurisdiction of
        the Supreme Court of the United States and the United
        States courts of appeals by depriving them of jurisdiction
        to review any determination made by any other court in
        any case involving "the validity under the Constitution,
        treaties, or laws of the United States of any constitutional
        provision, statute, or regulation of any State or any polit­
        ical subdivision thereof relating in any matter to­
           (1) 	 the establishment, maintenance, or operation of
                 public schools in such State;
    (      (2) 	 the conduct of any election within such State, the
                 qualifications of electors to vote in any election
                 within such State, or the method of determining
                 such qualifications; or
           (3) 	 the 'penal provisions of the law of such State,
                 or the procedure for the enforcement of such
                 provisions. "
           On the recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
        ence disapproved the bill.

                    ASSIGNMENT OF SENIOR JUDGES

           At the request of Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen the
        Conference authorized the Committee on Court Adminis­
        tration to consider the policy questions involved in grant­
        ing senior judges indefinite designations and assignments
        to sit in their own districts.

          GEOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION 

                  OF THE COURTS 

   Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Special
Committee on the Geographical Organization of the
Courts, authorized by the Conference at its September
1963 session (Conf. Rept., p. 65), presented the report of
the Committee.
            DIVISION OF THE NINTH CIRCUIT
   S. 1876, 88th Congress, would provide for the creation
of an eleventh judicial circuit to be comprised of Alaska,
Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington and would pro­
vide for two additional circuit judges to serve in the area
comprising the present Ninth Judicial Circuit. The Com­
mittee submitted a comprehensive analysis of the judicial
business in the circuit and concluded that there is no need
at the present time for a division of the Ninth Circuit or
for the creation of any additional circuit judgeships there­
in. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
ence disapproved the bill.                                   ()\
            DIVISION OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
   The Committee also submitted a comprehensive report
on the judicial business of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On the basis of its study
the Committee concluded that additional circuit judge­
ships were required in the circuit for the dispatch of the
judicial business of the court. The Committee was further
of the view that the circuit should be divided and recom­
mended a division of the Fifth Circuit with the states of
Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Mississippi to constitute
the new Fifth Circuit and the states of Louisiana and
Texas and the District of the Canal Zone to constitute the         I
new Eleventh Circuit. The Committee further recom­
mended that the new Fifth Circuit be authorized to have            I
a total of eight circuit judgeships and the new Eleventh
                                                                   i
                                                              L1 

                                                                   I
                                                                   I
                                       15

         Circuit a total of seven circuit judgeships. These recom­
         mendations were approved by the Conference.
(
            The Committee also reported that in its judgment nine
         is the maximum number of active judgeship positions
         which can be allotted to a court of appeals without impair­
         ing the efficiency of its operation and its unity as a judicial
         institution.

                      REVISION OF THE LAWS
            Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Com­
         mittee on Revision of the Laws, submitted the report of
         the Committee.
                           JURISDICTIONAL STUDY
            Judge Maris informed the Conference that the Com­
         mittees on Court Administration and Revision of the Laws
         had met jointly and had devoted a full day to a conference
         with representatives of the American Law Institute and
         representatives of the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules
    (	   in regard to problems and proposals under consideration
         by the American Law Institute in its current study of the
         Division of Jurisdiction between State and Federal
         Courts. The full discussion and frank exchange of views
         were stated by the representatives of the American Law
         Institute to be most helpful to them.
                    AMENDMENT OF THE TUCKER ACT
            The Conference was informed that the Committees on
         Court Administration and Revision of the Laws had con­
         sidered jointly the proposal of the Judicial Conference of
         the Tenth Circuit that the $10,000 jurisdictional ceiling
         on suits in the distriet courts under the Tucker Act, 28
         U.S.C. §1346(a) (2), be removed and had recommended
         that the proposal be approved. After full discussion the
         Conference voted to disapprove the proposal to remove the
         jurisdictional limitation, but authorized the Committees
                           16 


to consider enlarging the present $10,000 jurisdictional
ceiling on suits brought in the district courts under the
Tucker Act.

     ApPEALS IN PATENT AND TRADEMARK CASES
   The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 79) authorized the Committees on Court Admin­
istration and Revision of the Laws to give further con­
sideration to the proposals contained in S. 1940 and H.R.
7553, 88th Congress, which would amend the Patent and
Trademark statutes to eliminate the present requirement
that reasons of appeal in patent and trademark cases
must be filed in connection with appeals to the United
States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. The Com­
mittees reported that a majority of the members of the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals had approved H.R.
7553 with certain amendments to simplify the bill, while
at the same time preserving its purpose to eliminate the
requirement for reasons of appeal. The Committees rec­
ommended that H.R. 7553 be approved with the amend­
ments proposed by the Court of Customs and Patent
                                                            ()
Appeals. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.

                     INTERPRETERS
   H.R. 8136, 88th Congress, would provide for the desig­
nation of qualified interpreters to assist defendants in
criminal actions who are unable because of deafness to
understand the proceedings. The Committee called atten­
tion to the proposed amendments to Rule 28, Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure and Rule 43, Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, which would authorize the court to "ap­
point an interpreter of its own selection and determine
the reasonable compensation of such interpreter and di­
rect its payment out of such funds as may be provided by
law." In each case the Advisory Committee note contains
                                     17

        a statement that the rule is intended to cover interpreters
(       needed where a witness or a defendant is deaf as well as
        to assist non-English speaking defendants in understand­
        ing the proceedings or in communicating with counsel.
        The Commi ttee was of the view that these proposed
        changes in the rule to authorize the appointment of inter­
        preters will adequately meet the problem to which H.R.
        8136 is addressed. However, the Committee felt that the
        district court should have discretionary power in appro­
        priate cases to direct that the compensation of interpreters
        be paid by one or more of the parties and that such com­
        pensation may be taxed as costs in the case. This power
        does not clearly appear in the draft of amendments to the
        rules. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
        ference requested the standing Committee on Rules of
        Practice and Procedure to modify the proposed rules
        amendments relating to interpreters to the extent neces­
        sary to make such discretionary power explicit.

                      ADMINISTRATIVE CONFERENCE
    (                   OF THE UNITED STATES

           The Conference in March 1960 (Conf. Rept., p. 46) had
        approved in principle the establishment of a permanent
        conference on the procedures of Executive department
        and administrative agencies in adjudication and rulemak­
        ing. The Committee reported that S.1664, 88th Congress,
        which would provide for an administrative conference of
        the United States, had passed the Senate and that the
        views of the Judicial Conference on the bill had been re­
        quested by the House Judiciary Committee. Upon recom­
        mendation of the Committee, the Conference directed that
        the House Committee on the Judiciary be informed that
        the Conference approves in principle the proposal to create
        a permanent administrative conference contained in S.
        1664, but makes no recommendation with respect to the
        detailed provisions of the bill regarding the composition
                            18

and powers of the administrative conference since these
are not matters of primary concern to the Federal
Judiciary.

               TUCKER ACT AMENDMENTS

   The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 75) had deferred consideration of S. 1351 and
H.R. 6538, 88th Congress, pending inquiry concerning the
views of the Department of Justice. These. bills would
repeal subsection (d) of 28 U.S.C. 1346 to permit the
district courts to entertain civil actions by officers or
employees of the United States for compensation for offi­
cial services. The Committee pointed out that under the
provisions of the Act of October 6, 1962, (72 Stat. 744,
28 U.S.C. 1361) it is now possible for government em­
ployees who allege that they have been improperly dis­
charged from their employment to sue in their home
districts for reinstatement. However, under the provi­
sions of 28 U.S.C. 1346 (d) an employee's claim for back
pay, which very frequently accompanies his claim for re-     ()
instatement, must be brought in the Court of Claims. It
was the view of the Committee that the district courts
should be given jurisdiction of the compensation claim as
well as the improper discharge in order that these claims
may be disposed of in a single action. The Conference was
informed that the views of the Department of Justice on
the proposed legislation had not as yet been formulated.
Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference
voted to approve S. 1351 and H.R. 6538.

            PENSIONS OF RESERVE OFFICERS
                OF THE ARMED FORCES
   The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Repre­
sentatives had requested the views of the Conference on
H.R. 7711, 88th Congress, which is a bill to confer juris­
diction upon the district courts to adjudicate the claims

                                                              c;
                                                                  1
                                 19 


     of reserve officers to additional retired pay provided by
(	   the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement
     Equalization Act of 1948. The Conference was informed
     that claims of reserve officers under the Act had been de­
     cided adversely to them on the basis of statutory construc­
     tion in certain suits decided in the Court of Claims. In
     these circumstances, the Committee considered it inap­
     propriate to confer jurisdiction on the district courts to
     consider claims involving the same question and that if
     the intent of the Congress had not been made clear in the
     original Act, as construed by the Court of Claims, it would
     be more appropriate to provide a clarifying amendment
     to the Act. Accordingly the Conference, upon recommenda­
     tion of the Committee, disapproved the bill.

        JUDICIAL REVIEW OF DECISIONS OF THE FOREIGN
               CLAIMS SETTLEMENT COMMISSION

        The Committee on the Judiciary of the United States
     Senate had requested the views of the Conference on S.
 (   2426, 88th Congress, which would provide for the judicial
     review by the courts of appeals of determinations by the
     Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under the War
     Claims Act of 1948. Upon recommendation of the Com­
     mittee, the Conference voted to approve the form of judi­
     cial review provided in the draft legislation. The Confer­
     ence felt, however, that the question as to whether review
     should be granted in these cases is one of public policy to
     be determined by the Congress. The Conference also was
     of the view that the question whether the claimant only
     should have a right of review, as the bill provides, is a
     question of policy for the Congress.

                            LEGISLATION

       The Conference, on recommendation of the Committee,
     reaffirmed its approval of the following bills pending in
                             20

         p. 72).
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee, reaffirmed its disapproval of the proposals contained
in the following bills pending in the 88th Congress =
   (1) 	 S. 2294, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C.

         property the right to a determination by a jury

               INTERNATIONAL LEGAL CONFERENCES
       Judge Maris reported that a counterpart of the bill to
    authorize the Government to accept membership in the
    Hague Conference on Private International Law and the
     International (Rome) Institute for the Unification of
    Private Law, which had been approved by the Judicial
    Conference at its September 1963 session, had become law
     (Public Law 88-244, December 30, 1963). Pursuant to the
    request of the Secretary of State that he nominate a rep­
    resentative of the Judicial Conference to serve on an
    Advisory Committee to the Department of State on Pri­
    vate International Law, the Chief Justice had nominated
    Judge Maris and he had been appointed to the Advisory
    Committee.
       The Conference approved the nomination and appoint­
    ment of the Chairman of the Committee on Revision of
    the Laws as its representative on the Advisory Committee
    on Private International Law and authorized the Commit­
    tee on Revision of the Laws to collaborate with the Advi­
    sory Committee and the Department of State in the work
(   of the Hague Conference on Private International Law
    and the International (Rome) Institute for the Unifica­
    tion of Private Law.
         RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
       Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the stand­
    ing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, pre­
    sented to the Conference a report on the activities of the
    standing Committee and the Advisory Committees.
          ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON ApPELLATE RULES
       Judge Maris informed the Conference that a prelimi­
    nary draft of a complete set of uniform rules of federal
    appellate procedure had been received from the Advisory
    Committee on Appellate Rules and that publication and
    circulation of these draft rules to the bench and bar for
    comment and suggestion had been authorized.
                             22

   The Conference considered the question as to the man­
ner in which a set of appellate rules, when finally per­           (

fected, can be promulgated. Upon recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference approved a draft bill, sub­
mitted by the Committee, which would amend 28 U.S.C.
§2072, to enlarge the present civil rulemaking authority of
the Supreme Court of the United States to include appel­
late rules. The bill, as drawn, would extend the civil rule­
making power of the Supreme Court to include bank­
ruptcy proceedings and proceedings for the review and
enforcement of orders of administrative agencies. The bill
would also consolidate the present admiralty rulemaking
power with that for all other civil actions.
            ADVISORY COMMITTEES ON CIVIL 

                AND ADMIRALTY RULES 

   The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules had sub­
mitted to the standing Committee a preliminary draft of
amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and
supplementary rules in admiralty cases, designed to merge      (   ;.
the. admiralty procedure into the civil procedure. These
amendments to the Civil Rules had been prepared by the
Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules and approved
by the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. Additional
amendments to the Civil Rules formulated by the Civil                   i
Rules Committee and approved by the Admiralty Rules
Committee were also submitted to the Committee. The                     1
Conference was informed that both sets of proposed
amendments will be printed together and distributed to
                                                                        I
the bench and bar for comment and suggestion.                           I

      ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL RULES
   The proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure formulated by the Advisory Commit­
tee on Criminal Rules and circulated to the bench and bar
in December 1962 had produced many comments and sug­
                                 23 


    gestions. In the light of the suggestions received the
    Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules revised a number
    of these rules and in addition has formulated proposed
    amendments to other rules. These proposals have been
    submitted to the standing Committee, which has author­
    ized republication of all proposals, both old and new, so
    that they may be considered together.
       The Conference was informed that the standing Com­
    mittee is asking that the comments and suggestions of the
    bench and bar with regards to the drafts of Appellate,
    Civil-Admiralty, and Criminal Rules be made not later
    than April 1, 1965. The Committee plans to consider final
    drafts in the summer of 1965 and to transmit them to the
    Conference in September of that year. In accordance with
    this schedule the standing Committee is requesting the
    Judicial Conferences of the circuits and the appropriate
    bar association sections and committees to allot substan­
    tial time at their meetings during the coming year for con­
    siderationof the various rules proposals being submitted
(   by the Committee for public consideration at this time.
        INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
       The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on· Inter­
    circuit Assignments, Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported
    on the processing of requests for intercircuit assignments
    from August 2, 1963, to February 21, 1964. During this
    period the Committee recommended favorably on a total
    of 47 assignments. No adverse recommendation was made.
    The number of assignments is unusually large because of
    28 assignments which related to the national deposition
    program in the electrical equipment antitrust cases. These
    47 assignments were undertaken by 26 judges including
    3 active circuit judges, 13 active district judges, 4 senior
    circuit judges and 6 senior district judges.
       The Committee reported with regret its inability to meet
    the requirements of the very pressing and continuing need
                             24

of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and concluded
that if this need was to be met, the only immediate solu-       (
tion was the assignment to that court of additional judges
from other circuits. The Committee suggested that the
Conference request the chief judges of the various circuits
to make available all possible help to alleviate the situa­
tion. The report of the Committee was received and ap­
proved by the Conference.

         BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   Circuit Judge Bailey Aldrich on behalf of Senior Judge
Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
Bankruptcy Administration, reported that the Committee
had met and considered the recommendations contained in
the report of the Director of the Administrative Office
dated January 24, 1964, relating to the continuance of
referee positions to become vacant by expiration of term,
for changes in salaries of referees, changes in arrange­
ments, and the creation of new referee positions. The
Committee also considered the recommendations of the           ('I
district judges and the Judicial Councils of the circuits
concerned.
   The Conference considered fully the Committee's report
and the recommendations of the Director, Judicial Coun­
cils and the district judges. On the basis of the report and
recommendations, the Conference took the action shown
in the following table relating to changes in salaries and
the creation of new referee positions, and directed that,
unless otherwise shown, this action become effective on
July 1, 1964, or as soon thereafter as appropriated funds
are available:

                            ApPROPRIATIONS

   The Conference was informed that a supplemental ap­
propriation of $65,000 had been requested for the fiscal
year 1964 for salaries and expenses of Referees in Bank­
ruptcy to restore a reduction of $50,000 made in the orig­
inal estimate submitted for the fiscal year 1964 and to
provide funds for new referee positions and salary in­
creases authorized by the Conference a year ago.
   The appropriation request for the fiscal year 1965, if
approved by the Congress, will provide funds for the sala­
ries of approximately 60 additional clerical employees.
If, however, a salary increase is authorized for referees
and for the government service generally, additional ap­
propriations will be required.

                           JOINT PETITIONS
   At its September 1963 session (Conf. Rept., p. 88) the
Conference approved a proposal to amend the Bankruptcy
Act to permit the filing of joint petitions in bankruptcy
by husband and wife who have one or more joint obliga­
tions and authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to prepare an appropriate amendment for introduc­
tim\ in Congress. Upon the recommendation of the Com­
mittee, a draft bill, prepared by the Director, was approved
by the Conference.
                                 29 


         NOTICE OF FILING OBJECTIONS TO DISCHARGE
       The Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office
    had suggested an amendment to Section 14 (b) of the
    Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 32, to permit the court, before
    the filing fees required to be paid by the Act are paid in
    full, to make an order fixing a time for the filing of objec­
    tions to the bankrupt's discharge. At present such an
    order is not permitted until after the filing fees have been
    paid in full. The court is thus required in many cases,
    particularly those in which fees are paid in installments
    under General Order 35, to send a separate notice of the
    first meeting of creditors and a separate notice of the
    last day fixed by the court for the filing of objections to
    a discharge. The proposed amendment to Section 14 would
    permit the court to combine these two notices in almost
    every ordinary bankruptcy case at a substantial savings
    of time and cost. Upon recommendation of the Commit­
    tee a draft bill, prepared by the Administrative Office,
    was approved by the Conference.
(
                  FEES IN CHAPTER       XI   CASES

       Judge Edward Weinfeld had called to the attention of
    the Committee a practice becoming prevalent in Chapter
    XI proceedings in which the compensation of attorneys,
    accountants, and others is paid or promised by third par­
    ties. It has been held that such payments are beyond the
    control of the bankruptcy court. It was the view of the
    Committee that all such payments should be subject to
    the approval of the court in the same manner as payments
    made in proceedings under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy
    Act. The Conference, upon the recommendation of the
    Committee, authorized the Administrative Office to under­
    take a study of the need for remedial legislation and
    further authorized the Committee to recommend remedial
    legislation if it be deemed necessary.

 RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE .JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF 

              THE NINTH CIRCUIT 


   The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 89) directed that various proposed amendments
to the Bankruptcy Act, recommended by the Judicial
Conference of the Ninth Circuit, be referred to the Bank­
ruptcy Committee for study and report to the Conference.
These proposed amendments include (1) an amendment
to Section 67a(l) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 107
 (a) (1), relating to the status of liens in bankruptcy pro­
ceedings, (2) an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act to
authorize subsidiary and affiliated corporations to file
proceedings in the same district as a parent corporation,
and (3) an amendment, either of the Act or General
Orders, to require a referee before closing a case, to give
notice to creditors of dismissals for costs and of any waiver
or denial of a discharge in the proceedings.
   These proposals appear to be both technical and con­
troversial and have for some time been under consideration
by the National Bankruptcy Conference. It was the recom­        (   '.
mendation of the Committee that, inasmuch as no bills
embodying these proposals have been introduced in the
Congress and in view of their controversial nature, no
action should be taken at this time. The Conference ap­
proved this recommendation and discharged the Com­
mittee from further consideration of these proposed
amendments.

             AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   The Conference was informed that the examination of
statistical reports of closed bankruptcy cases for the deter­
mination of errors in the computation of amounts due
the referees' salary and expense fund and of overpayments
of compensation to receivers and trustees has continued.
No situation was reported with respect to the personal

                                                                    c
                            31 


accountability of a referee. However, the Administrative
Office had called attention to the difficulty encountered in
determining whether a monopoly of appointment of re­
ceivers and trustees actually existed in certain districts
because the statistical information available does not show
whether trustees are elected by creditors or appointed by
the referees. More information with respect to the election
of trustees by creditors is being developed and a report
will be made to the Committee at its next meeting.

              MATTER..'; UNDER ADVISEMENT

   The Committee reported that in accordance with the
direction of the Conference at its September 1963 session
 (Conf. Rept., p. 89) quarterly reports from referees
concerning matters held under advisement 60 days or
longer are now being made to the district courts with
copies of such reports to the Administrative Office. The
Committee plans to review these reports at its next meet­
ing to determine whether the district courts are taking
steps to bring about the decision of matters held under
advisement by referees for unusually long periods of time.

     DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER          XIII
   The Committee reported a continuing increase in the
use of wage earners' plans under Chapter XIII of the
Bankruptcy Act. Total cases filed during the fiscal year
1963 numbered 24,329, an increase of more than 6 percent
over the 22,880 cases filed during the fiscal year 1962.
At the current rate the expectation is that case filings·
under Chapter XIII during the current fiscal year may
reach 27,000.
   The Committee called attention to a proposal advanced
in one district that a corporate trustee be employed for
Chapter XIII cases. Upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee the Conference voted to disapprove the proposal.
                              32 


                     SPECIAL CHARGES
   Suggestions had been received from a number of ref-                  ('\
erees that a special charge be established for amending
the schedule of creditors after notice has been given of
the first meeting of creditors. Where such an amendment
occurs, a second notice to creditors is necessary and an
order must be prepared extending the time within which
objections to the discharge may be filed. It was the view
of the Committee that a special charge for the amendment
of a schedule will compensate to some extent for the ad­
ditional clerical work involved in mailing notices and
will result in the exercise of more care in the preparation
of schedules. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference approved the following additional special
charge for bankruptcy cases, effective April 1, 1964, the
proceeds of which are to be deposited in the referees'
salary and expense fund:
 For amendments to bankrupt's schedules of creditors after 

 notice to creditors, $10.00 for each amendment, provided that 

 the referee may, for good cause, waive the charge in any case.    (


               ADMINISTRATION OF
             THE PROBATION SYSTEM
   Judge Luther W. Youngdahl, Chairman of the Commit­
tee on the Administration of the Probation System, pre­
sented the report of the Committee to the Conference.
         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER
  The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 96) approved in principle the proposal for a
Federal Probation and Parole Research and Development
Center and authorized the Committee to work towards
the establishment of such a center. Judge Youngdahl re­
ported that the Committee had prepared a proposed bill
in the form of a Joint Resolution for introduction in
Congress, which would ( 1 ) establish a Research and

                                                                        (

Development Center in the Correctional Field, (2) amend
the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 5002 to give the Corrections
Council authority to direct studies relating to the problems
of treatment and correction of offenders, and (3) change
the organization and membership of the Corrections
Council by adding the Director of the National Institute
of Mental Health in place of the public member of the
Council. The Council would make its recommendations
to the Judicial Conference of the United States and to the
Attorney General instead of to the President and Con­
gress. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference approved the proposed Joint Resolution and
authorized the Committee or its Chairman to make such
further changes in it, after further discussion with rep­
resentatives of the Department of Justice and the National
Institute of Mental Health, as may be desirable.
   Judge Youngdahl informed the Conference that the
Probation Committee in conjunction with the National
Institute of Mental Health is planning a meeting of twelve
or more persons in the correctional field to be held at the
National Institute of Mental Health in May 1964. The
meeting will be called to consider and discuss the basic
assumptions underlying the administration of probation
and parole, to devise and recommend possible experiments
to test the validity of these assumptions, and to suggest
and recommend a program of practical and useful research
in this field.

  GROUP COUNSELING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

   The Committee requested and was granted authority to
seek funds for a study of the group counseling program in
the Probation Office of the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia with the understanding that,
if nongovernmental funds are sought, the Conference must
approve the source of the funds.

     COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF EXISTING PROBATION 

               AND PAROLE RECORDS 
                            0
   The Committee also requested and was granted au­
thority to seek funds for a retrospective study of probation
and parole records in the United States District Courts
for the Western District of Missouri and the Northern
District of Illinois to determine whether the effectiveness
of sentencing procedures can be analyzed, with the under­
standing that, if nongovernmental funds are sought, the
Conference must approve the source of the funds.

                SENTENCING INSTITUTES

   The Conference in September 1963 (Conf. Rept., p. 95)
authorized the Committee on Pretrial Procedure and the
Committee on the Administration of the Probation System
to conduct a program that would combine a sentencing
institute with a seminar for newly appointed United
States district judges. Judge Youngdahl informed the
Conference that an Institute on Sentencing and Seminar
for newly appointed United States district judges, at­
tended by approximately fifty circuit and district judges,
was held in Denver, Colorado, February 1-8, 1964.
   The sentencing institute portion of the program in­
cluded the discussion of procedures prior to trial; the
criminal trial; the problem of disparity; aids in sentenc­
ing available to the court; the application of psychiatry
to the study, observation, and treatment of federal of­
fenders; the use of probation; the use of commitment;
the sentence hearing; and probation supervision and rev­
ocation. The program featured a one-day visit to the
Federal Correctional Institution at Englewood, Colorado,
including a tour of the Institution, a demonstration of a
preliminary hearing by the Parole Board, and a demon­
stration by the Bureau of Prisons of the method used in
                             35 


formulating recommendations in the case of defendants
committed for observation and study.
             CIRCUIT COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
    Judge Youngdahl informed the Conference of the ap­
pointment of a subcommittee on presentence reports to
conduct a survey of district judges to secure their opinion
of the most recent proposal to change Rule 32 (c) (2) of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as contained in
the draft submitted by the Advisory Committee on Crim­
inal Rules to the bench and bar in December 1962. The
amendment requires the court on request to afford counsel
for the defendant an opportunity to read the presentence
report and to comment thereon.
    The Committee had received reports from the chief
judges in several districts that the work of their probation
officers is being impeded by the refusal of the Department
of Justice to permit probation officers to examine inves­
tigative reports relating to the facts of the offense in the
files of the United States attorneys. The Committee re­
ported that the situation had been brought to the attention
of the Deputy Attorney General who explained that the
Department of Justice had no intention of unnecessarily
impeding the work of probation officers. It was understood
that a clarifying communication would be sent to the
United States attorneys.

             SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
  The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Person­
nel, Chief Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report of
the Committee to the Conference.

       LAW CLERKS IN THE COURTS OF ApPEALS
  Chief Judge Levin informed the Conference that the
Committee had received several requests for additional
                                                                 I

and had concluded that additional law clerks should be
authorized for the courts of appeals. The Conference dis­
cussed the proposal fully and voted to recommend that each
                                                               <'I
United States court of appeals be authorized to employ
not to exceed three law clerks to be assigned from time to
time by the Chief Judge to cases or to judges as he may
deem desirable.

                    COURT REPORTERS

   The Conference was informed that the Committee's
study of the over-all problems of the federal court reporter
system, based on the replies to a direct inquiry to each
court reporter made by the Chairman of the Committee,
had been completed. A majority of the court reporters
who responded offered no criticism and made no recom­
mendation for change. Among those who did suggest
change, there was no consensus. On the basis of this sur­
vey the Committee reported that it has no recommendation
to make for change in the present court reporter system.
   The Committee had been requested to consider recom­
mending payment of a substitute court reporter. for a
reporter who was absent from his official duties because
of a tragic accident suffered by a member of his family.
There are no funds presently available to provide for pay­
ing substitute reporters because of illness or accident or
other circumstances affecting the members of a reporter's
family. The Committee, while sympathetic with the prob­
lem, did not consider it appropriate that any steps be
taken to provide for such payment.

         COST-OF-LIVING ALLOWANCES OUTSIDE 

            CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES 

  Chief Judge Walter H. Hodge of the District of Alaska
had brought to the attention of the Committee the problems
                                87

    that are caused by the fact that court reporters stationed
    outside continental United States do not receive the cost­
    of-living allowances granted other employees in the
    Judicial and Executive Branches of the Federal Govern­
    ment because of the statutory limitation on the salary
    authorized for a court reporter. Similarly, staff employees
    of judges have in some instances not received full cost-of­
    living allowances because of the limitation on aggregate
    salaries contained in the Appropriation Act. Upon recom­
    mendation of the Committee, the Conference directed the
    Administrative Office to take the necessary steps to obtain
    changes in the statutes to provide equivalent treatment
    to supporting personnel stationed outside continental
    United States who are not now receiving full cost-of-living
    allowances as are other employees.

                NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS
       The Committee had been advised by Chief Judge Henry
    O. Brooks of the Western District of Kentucky that the
    caseload of the United States commissioner for Mammoth
    Cave National Park was very light. In view of this the
    Committee recommended that the salary of the United
    States commissioner be reduced and that the salary be set
    at $1,000 per annum. This recommendation was approved
    by the Conference.

                 PROBATION TRAINING CENTER

       The Conference was informed that the application of the
    Judicial Salary Plan had nullified the differential pre­
    viously existing between the grade of the chief probation
    officer in the Northern District of Illinois, who also acts
    as Director of the Federal Probation Officer Training
    School, and other positions in the probation system. The
    Conference had previously authorized such a differential
    (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1958, p. 10). A similar differential in

the grade of the chief deputy officer has also been affected.
The Committee recommended therefore that the position
of the Chief Probation Officer in the Northern District of
Illinois be removed from the Judicial Salary Plan and
that the position be assigned a salary equivalent to that
of Grade GS-16 in the Classification Act of 1949, as
amended. The Committee also recommended that the Chief
Deputy Probation Officer position be placed in a grade
which will maintain any differential existing prior to the
application of the Judicial Salary Plan. These recom­
mendations were approved by the Conference.

                    RECLASSIFICATIONS
   Chief Judge Levin informed the Conference that the
Committee had received several requests for grade reclas­
sifications and salary increases. Consideration of these
requests has been deferred for further consideration at
the next meeting of the Committee.

                JUDICIAL STATISTICS                             ()
   The Chairman of the Committee on Judicial Statistics,
Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, presented the report of
the Committee.
            RECORDS OF COURTS OF ApPEALS
   Chief Judge Johnsen informed the Conference that the
Committee had studied the problem of the lack of uniform­
ity existing in the internal record practices and the re­
sultant lack of uniformity in the statistical portrayals of
the clerks' offices of the courts of appeals in regard to
matters other than appeals or reviews regularly docketed.
On the basis of its study the Committee recommended that
there be maintained in the clerks' offices of the courts of
appeals, in addition to the present docket, another record
book, to be provided by the Administrative Office, entitled

                                                                 (
                             39 


Miscellanemts Record. The matters to be entered in this
record would include:
    (1) 	 Applications in forma pauperis except those in­
          cident to matters regularly docketed. If the ap­
          plication to proceed in forma pauperis is granted,
          the matter would be transferred to the regular
          docket.
    (2) 	 Applications for permission to appeal under any
          statute requiring an allowance of an appeal in­
          cluding appeals under 28 U.S.C. §1292 (b) and
          appeals under. 11 U.S.C. §47(a). Where permis­
          sion to appeal is granted, the application would
          be transferred to the regular docket and the
          docketing fee would then be charged.
    (3) 	 Applications for the allowance or reduction of
          bond or bail, except where incident to a case
          already docketed, or where it is in the form of an
          appeal from an order refusing bail or denying
          reduction of bail and the docketing fee has been
          paid. See Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1.
    (4) 	 Applications by prisoners addressed to individual
          judges of courts of appeals requesting the issu­
          ance of writs of habeas corpus or certificates of
          probable cause.
    (5) 	 Applications for the stay of an order or judgment.
  . The Committee further recommended that a card index
be maintained by the clerks of the courts of appeals on all
applications entered in the miscellaneous record, that no
fee or charge be made for entering an application in the
miscellaneous record and that the Director of the Admin­
istrative Office be .authorized to give such directions or
suggestions to the clerks of the courts of appeals as may
be necessary in carrying these recommendations into ef­
fective operation.
    These recommendations were approved by the
Conference.
                            40 


    The Conference also approved the 'recommendation of
the Committee that applications under the "all writs"        (" .
statute, 28 U.S.C. §1651, and any other application made
which' the court has plenary power to entertain and as to
which there is no statutory provision requiring leave to
file, be entered on the regular docket, provided they are
accompanied by the regular docketing fee.
   The Committee reiterated its views that where both the
plaintiff and defendant appeal from a.judgment, or where
a number of defendants file separate and not joint notices
of appeal, each should be charged a docketing, fee and
each appeal should be given a separate docket number.
A separate docketing of appeals, however, would,not pre­
vent the court from consolidating cases for the purposes
of the printed record, briefs, hearing, or opinion.
                DEFINITION OF A TRIAL
   Chief Judge Johnsen informed the Conference that the
Committee had considered requests by several district
judges that hearings on preliminary injunctions and other (}
interlocutory proceedings which are contested be consid­
ered trials for statistical' purposes. The Committee was
of the view that these proceedings should be counted as
trials and voted to recommend that a trial,for statistical
purposes, be defined as "a contested proceeding before
either the court or a jury in which evidence is introduced."
This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
           ApPLICATION IN FORMA PAUPERIS
   At the request of the Committee the Conference recom­
mended that the district courts direct that motions to va­
cate sentence brought under 28 U.S.C. §2255, and appli­
cations for writs of habeas' corpus, accompanied by mo­
tions for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, be docketed
and that rulings on these matters be made only after they
have been docketed.

                                                             (J
                                 41

       Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference
    reaffirmed the action taken at its September 1962 session
     (Conf. Rept., p. 76) that the courts be instructed to docket
    all motions to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. §2255 on
    the civil dockets.
                    ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS
       At the request of Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen a
    proposal to create an additional judgeship in the District
    of Maryland was referred to the Committees on Judicial
    Statistics and Court Administration for study and report
    to the Conference.

                   PRETRIAL PROCEDURE
      The Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure,
    Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, presented the report of
    the Committee.
              SEMINAR FOR NEW DISTRICT JUDGES
       Judge Murrah informed the Conference that in con­
    tinuation of the program of the Conference to acquaint
    newly appointed district judges with the problems of
    judicial administration they are likely to encounter in
    the operation of their courts, the Committee had joined
    with the Committee on the Administration of the Pro­
    bation System in sponsoring an Institute on Sentencing
    and Seminar for Newly Appointed District Judges which
    was held in Denver, Colorado, February 1-8. This was
    the first such combined program and from the comments
    of the participants, it appears to have been very success­
    ful. Twenty-one newly appointed district judges from
    seventeen different districts, most of whom were appointed
    sin~e the previous Seminar in August 1962, were in at­
    tendance. In addition, two judges recentlyappoiuted to
    courts .of appeals and a trial commissioner from the Court

(
                               42

of Claims were present. Altogether, 111 United States
district judges appointed since the Omnibus Judgeship                (\
Act of May 19, 1961 (or shortly before) have now attended
a seminar session.

       SUBCOMMITTEE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION
   The subcommittee of the Pretrial Committee appointed
to consider discovery problems arising in mUltiple liti­
gation with common witnesses and exhibits has continued
to assist in the conduct of the program for the trial and
disposition of the antitrust treble damage actions which
arose out of the criminal antitrust proceedings in the
electrical equipment industry in Philadelphia in 1961.
Several phases of the national deposition program insti­
tuted under the direction of the Coordinating Committee
of Judges responsible for the litigation, including the pre­
trial deposition and examination of more than 185 witnes­
ses, have been completed. The trial of the first case has
begun and trials in several other cases have been tenta­
tively scheduled to commence this year.                      ()
   The subcommittee has given concentrated study to the
problems which have developed in the electrical equipment
antitrust cases during the last two years and believes that
the experience gained through the. study, work and re­
search involved in these cases will be of great relevance in
other types of multiple litigation. The following resolution
authorizing a continuation of the work of the subcommit­
tee was thereupon approved by the Conference:
  "RESOLVED,   that the subcommittee appointed to consider dis­

 covery problems arising in' multiple litigation with· common 

 witnesses and exhibits is authorized to conduct a thorough 

 review and study of the. program and of the unique eXperi­

 ence of the judges having. the r,esponsibility for the private 

 antitrust litigation in the electrical equipment industry so as 

 to develop from this experience general principles and guide- . 

 lines for use in other multiple litigation,inciuding any recom­
                              43

  mendations for statutory change; and further, that the sub­
  committee is authorized to consult and cooperate with the
  Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
  in the development of any desirable rules of procedure for
  multiple litigation. The Chief Justice is authorized in his
  discretion to expand the membership of the subcommittee."


         SURVEY OF JUDICIAL BUSINESS
   The Conference received reports from the Chief Judge
of the Court of Claims, the Chief Judge of the Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals, and from the Chief Judges
of the respective circuits concerning the state of the
dockets in their courts and circuits. These reports were
supplemented by the district judges who presented ad­
ditional details concerning the business of the district
courts of the circuits. The Conference was informed of a
general increase this year in the judicial business of the
courts, particularly in the courts of appeals in several
circuits. The district courts are continuing to give at­
tention to the disposition of civil actions pending more than
three years.

  PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS
               OF APPEALS

   At the request of Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, the
Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that
terms of the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit at
places other than St. Louis be pretermitted during the
fiscal year commencing July 1, 1964.

       RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of
                          44
