Hastings, Chairman of the Committee To Implement the Criminal
Justice Act of 1964, presented to the Conference a comprehensive re­
port of the activities of the Committee and its recommendations. The
report included, as appendixes (1) standard voucher and other forms
for use by the courts; (2) six suggested district court plans for use
in districts of varying size and characteristics; and (3) the text of
the Criminal JustIce Act of 1964, (Public Law 88-455, 78 Stat. 552,
approved Aug. 20, 1964).
   There were also submitted with the report a copy of the minutes
of the Committee meeting of October 17, 1964, which had been pre­
viously distributed to all U.S. district judges, and a copy of the re­
port of the Ad Hoc Committee Appointed To Develop Rules, Pro­
cedures, and Guidelines for an Assigned Counsel System, approved
by the Judicial Conference in September 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 91).
   The Conference, after full consideration and discussion of the re­
port, adopted the following resolutions of authorization and direc­
tion to the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,
with respect to his duties under the Criminal Justice Act:
   III his responsibility for supervision of payments from the appropriations
under the Act, the Director of the Administrative Office is authorized to aftopt   (
alld use a system of central disbursement for all appropriated iun(ts, reqniring
notification to the Administrative Office of every appointment of eoul1sel and
authQrization of other services as they are made; the transmission of vouehers
to the Administrative Office for payment, containing adequate infnrmation as to
the l~atnre and extent of servkes rendered, both in and out ,)f court, and the
expenses incurred, and with payments to be made directly from the Adminis­
trative Office, rather than loeally; and
   The Director is further authori7,ed under the supervision and direction of

mediate release to all Federal judge~ clerks of court, and other in­
terested parties. The report of the '-JOmmittee, the appendixes, and
other pertinent documents submitted to the Conference are appended
to and made a part of this report.

          REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE 

                 CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964 

     To the Ohief JU8twe of the United States, Ohairman, and the Mem­
         ber8 of the Judiaial Oonferenee of the United States:
       Your Committee To Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 1
     submits the following report.
                                          INTRODUCTION

        The appointment of the Committee resulted from a recommenda­
     tion made to the Conference at its annual meeting in September 1964
     by the Ad Hoc Committee Appointed To Develop Rules, Procedures,
     and Guidelines for an Assigned Counsel System. The activities of
     your Committee are based, in part, on the work and the report of the
     Ad Hoc Committee. It seems desirable, therefore, to review, briefly,
     the salient features of that report, particularly its recommendations
     and conclusions.
        The policy recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee, approved
     in principle by the Conference, include (1) the use of a system of
     central dIsbursement of funds appro}?riated to carry out the Crim­
     inal Justice Act, and (2) the admimstration of the act through a
     framework of boards of advisers to the judicial councils of the circuits,
     assisted by full-time, compensated officers.
        The Ad Hoc Committee also recommended, and the Conference
     approved~
              (1) Budget estimates for the first year of operation under the
           act;
              (2) A suggestion that the chief jud~e of each circuit convene a
           meetmg of the chief judges of the dIstrict courts in his circuit
           to consider the problems of administration under the act, the
           urgency of developing practical and acceptable plans in each
           district, ways and means of stimulating the interest and securing
           the support and cooperation of the bar in every district in the
           implementation of the act, and to make plans for the a]:>pointment
•"         from the bar of an appropriate board of advisers to the judicial
           council;
              (3) The convening of a special session of the Judicial Con­
           ference for the exclusive purpose of considering the problems of
t'         administration arising under the Criminal J ustlCe Act; and
              (4) A grant of authority to the Chief Justice to supersede
           the Ad Hoc Committee with It larger committee to implement the
           Criminal Justice Act, with district judges to be included in its
           membership.
      1   Public Law 88-455, approved Aug. 20, 1'964. 

                                                                       3



             42--3490--65---2
4            JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

   Thereafter, the Chief Justice requested the three members of the
Ad Hoc Committee 2 to continue to serve as members of the new Com­
mittee and appointed, as additional members, six district judges. The
Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee was also designated as Chairman
of your new Committee. Upon its formation, the Committee held
an orl$&nizational meeting in San Francisco on October 17, 1964. At
that tIme the report and recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee
were reviewed in detail and fully endorsed, and the problems presented
by the new legislation were carefully explored. Arrangements were
made for a division of assignments among the Committee members.
Each district judge member of the Committee was requested to pre­
pare, in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act,
a suggested district court plan for possible adoption in a district
court having the chara.cteristics of the district in which he was serving.
  Thereafter the Committee met in Washington, D.C., on November 14,
1964, and again on December 5, 1964. Meanwhile, the urgent need
for the district courts to begin consideration of plans for the repre­                           ..
sentation of defendants in their courts, who are financially unable to
obtain an adequate defense, made it important for them to be kept
advised of the work of your Committee. Accordingly, the minutes of
the Committee meeting of October 17, 1964, were distributed to all
district judges on November 5. Following consideration and dis.cus­
sion on November 14 of the six suggested plans for district courts,
some of which had undergone numerous drafts, your Committee au­
thorized their release on December 7 to all Federal judges for their
information and guidance.
                                 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

   The chronology of events constituting the legislative history of
the Criminal Justice Act is set out in the September 1964 report of
the ad hoc committee. It is pertinent to note again that the legisla­
tive history of the act is extensive in its expression of congressIOnal
intent and is replete with ideas and suggestions concerning matters
of an administrative nature. Hearings on the legislation were con­
ducted by the Judiciary Committees In both the Senate· and House
of Representatives, 3 formal written reports were filed in both Houses
of Congress,4 and a separate re:port was filed by a conference com­
mittee. s For the most part, thIS legislative history is available in
published form. 1I
   Two specific limitations on the scope and applicability of the new
statute are imposed by the terms of the act, or made clear from its
legislative history. First, the act does not apply in habeas corpus
cases, in proceedings to vacate sentence brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255,
  • Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman; Chief Judge Harvey Y. Johnsen; and Chief
Judge Alfred P. Murrah.
  • Hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary, U.;S. Senate, May· 13, 20, and 211.
1963; hearlngs before Subcommittee No. 5 of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of
Representatives, May 22, 1963.                  .

       or in any other proceeding of a similar character, which is collateral
       to the orig!nal criminal case. The act provides simply that-
         A defendant for whom counsel is appointed shall be represented at every
       stage of the proceedings from his initial appearance before the United States
       commissioner or court through appeaL7
          Secondly, the act does not authorize the use of Federal J.>ublic
        defenders either on a part-time or on a full-time basis. As origInally
       .passed by the Senate the legislation contained a provision permitting
        the appointment of public defenders; however, when objection was
        made III the House of Representatives, the Senate receded from its
        position, and the provision for public defenders was stricken from
        the bill by the conferees.
          In doing 	so the conferees recommended that the Department of
". 	    Justice conduct a study and analysis in order to reexamine and re­
        evaluate the need for a Federal public defender system throughout
        the entire Federal judicial system. In connection with this study,
        the conferees suggested that the Department of .Justice utilize the
"       cooJ.>eration of the Judicial Conference of the UnitM States and the
        judICial councils of the circuits in order t.o obtain the benefit of the
        Federal judges' experience in the operation of the Criminal Justice
        Act. The conferees expressed the hope that a report of the con­
        clusions and recommendations of the Department of Just.ice will be
        made to the Congress as expeditiously as proper, after adequate facts
        and experience afford a sound basis for proper conclusions and
        recommendations.
          Your Committee is of the view that the recommended study ought
        to be undertaken exrditiously and recommends tha.t the Attorney
        General be in forme that the Judicial Conference is prepared to
        cooperate with the Department. of Justice in its conduct of the survey
        and study.
                                      DISTRICT OOURT PLANS

          The mat.ter of formulating plans for the representation of defend­
       ants "who are financially unable to obtain an adequate defense," or
       who, for purposes of appeal, are "financially unable to obtain ade­
       quate representation," IS by the act made the responsibility of the
       district courts and the judicial councils, respectively. The Commit­
       tee is of the view that it is not within its province, or that of the
       Judicial Conference, to prescribe any specific or model plan or plans
       for initial adoption by any district court. Indeed, it would hardl,
       be possible to do so in view of the variances in conditions and facih­
       ties whioh exist among the nutnerous distriots..
          The Committee has felt, however, that it can be of substantial
       assistance to the district courts by conveying to them the benefit of
       its deliberation, experience, and study. In distributing the six sug­
       gested plans, originally framed by members of the Committee and
       modified by discussion, the Committee has provided each district.
       court with a variety of provisions on various probl6IIls potentially
       arising in the administration of the Criminal Justice Aot, from
       which it can benefit in developing plans for itsown district.
         718   u.Ijl.e.   3006A(e).
6              JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

   Your Committee does wish to point out two areas of administra­
tion of the act, presenting problems common to all districts, which
should be treated uniformly on a national basis. These areas are
the determination of "financial inability to obtain an ad::c\uate
defense" and the maintenance of "continuity in representation.'
   It is clear from the legislative history of the act that the "test
of financial inability" is not the same as a "test of indigency." A
defendant need not be destitute to enjoy the benefits of this legisla­
tion. s For this reason, the term "indigency" should be avoided in
district court plans. The ('.,.ommittee is of the view, however, that
every district court plan should specify that "financial inability"
will be determined only after appropriate inquiry. A short form
of affidavit and order appointing counsel (CJA form No.1) for
use by a U.S. commissioner, a form of order appointing counsel                    -~

 (CJA form No.2) for use by the district judge, and a form of
affidavit of financial~tus (CJA form No.3) for use by either the
judge or the U.S. commissioner where detailed information concern­
ing financial status is appropriate, have been prepared by the Ad­                ., 

ministrative Office and approved by the Committee.9 Modifications in 

these forms, demonstrated to be necessary by experience, can be 

made by the Administrative Office with the a~proval of the Commit­

tee. It is recommended that every district Incorporate in its plan 

a requirement that these standard forms be used. 

   The act 10 provides that "a defendant for whom counsel is ap­
pointed shall be represented at every stage of the proceedings from
his initial appearance before the United States commissioner or
court through appeal." It is im{lortant therefore that continuity of
representation be maintained. So that a hiatus may be avoided,
the Committee recommends that counsel appointed by commissioners
should serve until further order of the judge.
   Likewise every district court plan should contain a provision stat­
ing the point at which the duties of counsel appointed by the district
court terminate and the duties of appellate counsel, if separate
counsel is provided, are to commence. In this regard, the Committee
recommends the inclusion of the following provisIon in every district
court plan:
  In the event that a defendant is ronvicted following trial, counsel appointed
hereunder shall advise the defendant of bis right of appeal and at his right to
counsel on appeal. If requested to do so by the defendant, counsel shall file
a timely notice of appeal, and he shall rontinoo to represent the defendant
unless, or until, he Is relieved by the Court of Appeals.            .
  In its deliberations, the Committee has considered various aspects
of questions likely to arise in the administration of a district court
plan under the act. Expressions of view on these matters by the
Committee are set forth as guidelines to the district courts:
(a) Ha:penlfelf Of oounlle'
                                                                                  '.
  Under the pr()vision ()f the act that an attorney "shall be reimbursed f()r
expenses reasonably incurred" -the questioB arises as to the policy to be
followed in dealing with a claim by an attorney for an allocated part of his
general omce overhead, such as rent, telephone service, and secretarial help.

                 JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                            7
     Conventionally, no charge is made by the lawyer against his cUen,t as an
     allocation of the regular cost of his ()fIlce and practice. Only special expenses,
     occasioned by the particular case, are ordinarily made the subject of a distinct
     charge against a cUent. Neither the language nor the hi~ory of the act con­
     tains anything to suggest an intent to depart from this concept and practice as
     to expenses.
     (b) Paymcnts by thc defendant
        It may frequently occur that a particular defendant, although financially
     unable to obtain an adequate defense, is capable of making a partial payment
     toward the cost of such a defense. This may become evident from the exami­
     nation of him by the court or by the U.S. commissioner, or it may arise from
     an event occurring subsequent to the appointment of counseL A district court
     plan may properly place upon appointed counsel the duty of reporting to the
     court any situation coming ,to his attention where a defendant appears to be
     able to finance a portion of his defense.
        Subsection (0 of the act gives to the court the control of any payments
     "from or on behalf of a defendant." The Commi·ttee recommends that all
     payments made by the defendant, particularly to court-appointed counsel, be
     strictly controlled to the end that total compensation to court-appointed counsel
     and to others not exceed the maximum permitted by the act.
     (c) Invcstigativc scrviccs
       The Committee rec()mmends that the allowances of petitions for investiga­
     tive services be strictly limited, to the extent possible, to those charges neces·
     sary in the strictest sense of the word. A provision may well appear in each
     plan staUng as a matter of policy that applications for the ratification of
     expenses incurred without court approval are not looked upon with favor
     except in most unusual situations.
     (d) 	 Bubmission of cZaims
       The efficient administration of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 on a national
     basis requires that claims for services and expenses be submitted for payment
     as expeditiously as possible. Provisions relating to the timely submil!lSion
     of claims should be included in every district court plan.

                       PLANS FOR REPRESENTATION ON APPEAL

        The judicial council of each circuit is required by the act to supple­
     ment each district court plan with provisions for representa.tion on ap­
     peal. Your Committee has thus far given priority of consideration to
     the district court plans, since they are to be on file with the judicial
     councils of the circuits by February 20, 1965. The Committee will
     continue its examination of the problems involved in the development
     of plans 'by the .judicial councils and will report at the March 1965
     session. of the Conference. At that time the district court plans will
     be available. The judicial councils are not required to file their sup­
     plemental plans with the Director of the Administrative Office until
     May 20, 1965.        .
        On preliminary consideration, however, the Committee has C011­

·.   cluded (1) that there should be only one plan in each circuit, which is
     to be made a supplement to all district court plans in that circuit;
      (2) that there should be a continuity of representation to the end that
     there will be no hiatus in the availability of counsel in the interval be­
     tween trial and aI>pealj and (3) that counsel appointed on appeal
     should advise the defendant of his right to initiate a further review
     by the filing of a petition for certioran, and to file such petition, if re­
     quested by the defendant.
        Consideration was given to the desirability of automatically con­
     tinuing the appointment of trial counsel to prosecute the appeal. Mat­
8         JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

ters of appellate competency, geography, and expense have led the
Committee to conclude that this procedure should be left for determi­
nation in each circuit.
                     ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION

   The Ad Hoc Committee recommended, and the Conference approved
in principle, the administration of the Criminal Justice Act through a
framework of boards of advisers to the judicial councils of the circuits,
assisted by full-time, compensated officers. While recognizing the
need for a sound organization to assi<st the district courts in the admin­
istration of the Criminal Justice Act, the Committee has deferred con­
sideration of the duties to be performed by a full-time compensated
officer. Experience in the operation of district court plans will pro-       .~
vide a basis for determining the precise duties that might be assigned
to such full-time officers.
   The Committee believes, however, that the selection of boards of
advisers to the judicial councils by the chief judges of the district
courts in the near future would be desirable. Cooperation by the
courts with the members of the bar in the early development of dis­
trict and circuit plans will assure their cooperation in the administra­
tion of these plans in the future. In this regard, assistance that can
be rendered by legal aid societies is not to be overloQked. The Com­
mittoo recommends that appointments of lawyers as members of 'boards
of advisers be made for definite terms, that these terms be sta,g'gered
and that, ordinarily, a board member should not be eligible rorre­
appointment upon the expiration of his term.
                        DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS

   Subsection (g) of section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964
provides that the Judicial C-onference of the United States may
spedfl the form ~nd ~he times in w~ich district courts and ~he judicia:!
counCIls of the CIrcUIts shall submIt reports on the appomtment of
counsel, within its jurisdiction, to the Administrative Office of the
U.S. Courts.
   Subsection (h) provides that payments from appropriations for
carrying out the provisions of the act shall be made under the super­
vision of the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
   To effectuate the objectives of these subsections and to enable them
to serve facilitatingly III the administration of the act, the Committee     \
                                                                                 v
recommends that the Conference adopt the following resolutions of
authorization and direction:
   (1) In his responsibility for supervision of payments from' the
appropriations under the act, the Director of the Administrative
Office IS authorized to adopt and use a system of central disbursement
for all appropriated funds, requiring notification to the Administra­
tive Office of every appointment of counsel and authorization of other
services as they are made; the transmission of vouchers to the Ad­
ministrative Office for payment, containing adequate information as
to the nature and extent of services rendered, both in and out of court,
and the expenses incurredl. and with payments to be made directly
from the Administrative 0111ce, rather than locally j and
          JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                    9
   (2) The Director is further authorized, under the supervision and
direction of the Committee To Implement the Criminal Justice Act of
1964:, to request any other reports from a district court and from a
judicial council in such form and at such times as he deems necessary
or desirable for statistical information or other purposes under the
act.
   The Administrative Office, pursuant to Conference endorsement
of the central d'isbursement of funds appropriated to administer
the Criminal Justice Act, has prepared a series of uniform appoint­
ment and voucher forms for use nationally. These are set out in
appendix 1. Under this system the Adnunistrative Office will be
notified promptly of each' appointment as it is made and vouchers
approved by the court will be submitted directly to the Administrative
Office for payment. Each voucher will be ruudited in advance of
payment to determine whether, on its face, it is sufficient to comply
with the statute and with the plan approved for the particular dis­
trict court. All checks will be issued dirootly from Washington.
The voucher forms have received detailed consideration by the Com­
mittee and have been approved for use by the Director of the Admin­
istrative Office, subject to any n~ry approval by the General
Accounting Office. Revisions in these forms, as dictated by experi­
ence, will be made from t'irne to time, subject to the approval of the
Committee. The Committee recommends that each distl"lct court plan
embody a statement that the disbursement of funds under the act
will be in accordance with the plan of central disbursement approved
by the Conference 'and on forms prescribed by the Director of the
Administrative Office as approved by your Committee.
                            APPROPRIATIONS

   The carrying out of the intent of the Congress in enructing the
Criminal Justice Act is dependent upon adequate appropriations to
finance the system. Last September the Judicial Conference, on
recommendatIOn of the Ad Hoc Committee, approved a bu~et request
in the sum of $7,500,000 for the first year of operation under the act.
Your Committee believes that this estimate of appropriation require­
ments is reasonable and recommends that the Conference renew its
approval of this appropriation item. Funds to implement the act
will, of course, not be available before July 1, 1965, and if the appro­
priations bill is not enacted until after that date, the funds will not
be available until an even later date.     ,
                       RULES AND REGULATIONS

  Subsection (g) of section 2 of the act contains a provision that
"the Judicial Conference of the United States may, from time to
time, issue ,rules and. regul!l'tions governing the operation. of .pl~s
formulated under thIS sectlon." The langUage of authOrizatIOn IS
as to rules and regulations "governing the operation of plans formu­
lated" alld not governing the forrnulation of plans. The matter of
formulating pla.ns is by other prov,isions of the act made the respon­
sibility of each individual district court, "with the approval of the
jUdiciaJ council of the circuit."
10        JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

   Your Committee, therefore, is of the view that any rules or regula­
tions on the part of the Conference should await a demonstra.ted need
for some express or general direction resulting from the operation of
the numerous plans as they have been formulated. While the Com­
mittee is not recommending any rules or regulations as to plans for
adoption by the Conference at this time, it believes that it would be
useful for the Committee to make some general expressions at this
preliminary stage, subject to Conference approval.
   The Committee beheves that it will materially assist the district
courts in their task of formulating plans and will contribute greatly
to the successful working of such plans, to seek the cooperation of
members of the bar and of appropriate bar associations. It should
be emphasized that the resJ?onsibility of members of the bar to accept
appointments and to serve III these cases is the same as it traditionally
has been and that the passage of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964
in no way lessens the responsibility of members of the bar to accept
these appointments. The payment of compensation to counsel under
the act will, in most cases, be something less than compensatory. Serv­
ice of counsel by appointment under the act will continue to require
a substantial measure of dedication and public service.
   The Committee further believes that all will agree that the courts
in formulating and administering their plans will be particularly
scrupulous to safeguard against the opportunity for any charges of
fiscal laxity, favoritism, or other abuse which can cast a shadow
on the general judicial system. The public funds involved will, of
course, be expended with characteristic judicial responsibility.             (
   What is perhaps most important of all to be borne in mind is that
the act should be administered so that those accused of crime will not,
because they are financially unable to pay therefor, be deprived of any
element of representation which is soundly necessary to enable them
to have fair opportunity for defense and opportunity for trial. What
is sound and reasonably necessary is a matter for the practical and
responsible judgment of the court.                                 '

                             ApPENDIX 2
        SIX SUGGESTED DISTRICT COURT PLANS
                           ApPENDIX 2-A
A SUGGESTED PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
  SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, PURSUANT TO THE CRIMINAL
  JUSTICE ACT OF 1964
Prepared by Judge Dudley B. BonsaI, Southern District of New
                           York
   Pursuant to the provisions of section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act
of 1964 (Public Law 88--455 approved Aug. 20, 1964; 18 U.S.C.
3006A), the judges of the U.S. District Court for the Southern Dis­
trict of New York have adopted the following plan for the adequate
representation, as provided III paragTaphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of
section 2, of defendants charged with felonies or misdemeanors
(other than petty offenses as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1) who are finan­
cially unable to obtain an adequate defense, and for the furnishing of
investigative, expert, and other services as provided in paragraph (e)
of section 2.
   As provided in paragraph (a) of section 2, this plan combines
representation by private attorneys and representation by attorneys
furnished by a bar association or a legal aid agency.
   The Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the county
bar associations of each county within this district are designated as
the bar associations, and the Legal Aid Society of the City of New
York (Legal Aid Society) is designated as the legal aid agency under
this plan, pursuant to paragraph (a) (2) of sectIon 2, provided that
t.he names of attorneys furnished by a bar association and by the
Legal Aid Society shall be approved by the court before being in­
cluded in the panel of attorneys available for the representation of
such defendants.
                         I. PANEL OF ATl'ORNEYS
  The bar associations and the Legal Aid Society (with respect to
attorneys in its employ) are invited to prepare and to certify to the
chief judge not later than May 1, 1965, a list of attorneys who are
a.dmitted to practice before this court and who, in the opinion of the
bar association or of the Legal Aid Society, are competent to give
adequate representation to defendants under the act. Each judge
of this court is invited to furnish to the chief judge on or before
May 1, 1965, a list of attorneys whom he desires to have included in
the panel of attorneys. Each name on a list shall be accon;tpanied by
the address and telephone number of the attorney, and brIef data as
to his experience. From the lists so furnished, the chief judge,
                                                              81
32        JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

with the approval of the court, shall establish a panel of attorneys on
or before June 15, 1965. The panel of attorneys shall list each attor­
ney, his address and telephone number, and brief data as to his 'ex­
perience, and shall be subdivided to show separately the attorneys
supplied by the Legal Aid Society, each bar association, and by the
judges of the court. Additions and deletions to the panel of attor­
neys may be made from time to time by vote of the judges of the
court or by the chief judge if authorized to do so by the judges of
the court. A copy of the original panel of attorneys shall be fur­
nished by the chief judge to each district judge and to each U.S.
commissioner not later than June 15, 1965, and the chief judge shall
furnish to each district judge and to each U.S. commissioner copies
of revised panels of attorneys from time to time, as he shall deem
necessary or appropriate.                                                     '.
               II. DETERMINATION OF NEED FOR COUNSEL

   Each defendant charged with a felony or misdemeanor (other than
a petty offense as defined in the Criminal Code) shall be advised at
the earliest practicable stage in the proceeding of his right to counsel
and shall be asked whether he is financially able to obtain counsel in
his defense. 'Whenever such a defendant states that he is financially
unable to obtain counsel, and applies for the appointment of counsel,
it shall be the duty of the distrIct judge or the U.S. Commissioner, as
the case may be, to inquire into and to make a finding as to whether
such defendant is financially able to obtain counsel. All statements
made by such defendant in such inquiry shall be either under oath in
open court or by affidavit sworn to before the district judge or the
commissioner. If, on the basis of such inquiry, the judge or the com­
missioner finds that such defendant is financially unable to obtain coun­
sel, he shall appoint counsel for such defendant in the manner herein­
after provided III article III hereof.
                      ill. APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

  A. In proceeding8 before a U.S. oommwoner:
       1. In all communities wherein the Legal Aid Society of the City 

     of New York maintains an office, the commissioner shall designate 

     and appoint from the panel of attorneys an attorney employed 

     by the said Society and furnished to him for the purpose, as coun­

     sel for all defendants whom the commissioner finds are unable 

     to obtain counsel. In communities where the Legal Aid Society 

     does not maintain an office or where the Legal Aid Society is un­

     able to furnish counsel because of conflict of interest or other rea­

     son, the commissioner shall designate and appoint from the panel 

     of attorneys an attorney as counsel who has his office in the com­

    munity where the commissioner is sitting, or in which the defend­

    'ant resides. 

        2. To the extent practicable, the commissioner shall appoint the 

     same attorney as counsel for all such defendants appearing be­

     fore him on the same day. 

        3. Counsel shall be designated and appointed by the commis­

     sioner, and no such defendant shall select his own counsel from 

     the panel of attorneys or otherwise. 

               JUDICIAL CONFIDRENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                   33
           4. Counsel appointed by a commissioner shall represent the de­
         fendant in proceedings before the commissioner and thereafter
         until the defendant's first appearance before a district judge.
       B. In proceedinr;8 before a district judge:
            1. The distrlct judge shall make his own finding of the need to
         appoint counsel for any defendant, but he may base such finding
         upon the affidavit made by the defendant before the commissioner
         or upon the record, if any, made before the commissioner.
            2. The district judge may either reappoint counsel appointed by
         the commissioner for such defendant, or he may appoint new
         counsel.
            3. Counsel appointed by the district judge at the defendant's
        first appearance shall continue to act for the defendant throughout
         the proceedings in this court and through appeal, unless or until
         he is relieved oy the court of appeals.
            4. In all communities wherein the Legal Aid Society main­
         tains an office, the district judge shall designate and a ppomt from
         the panel of attorneys an attorney employed by the said society
        and furnished to him for the purpose, as counsel for such de­
        fendant, unless the district judge shall determine that other coun­
        sel should be appointed. In c.ommunities where the ~al Aid
        Society does not maintain an office or where the Legal Aid130ciety
         is unable to furnish counsel because of conflict of interest or other
         reason, or where the judge determines that other counsel should
        be appointed, the district judge shall appoint counsel from the
        panel of attorneys, except that if the dIstrict judge shall find
        that a defendant could be more adequately represented by coun­
        sel not on the panel of attorneys, he may request the chief judge
         to add such counsel to the panel, stating briefly his reasons there­
        for, and the district judge may appoint such counsel if such coun­
        sel is made a member of the panel of attorneys pursuant to article
        I hereof.             .
            5. Counsel shall be designated and appointed by the district
        judge, and no such defendant shall select hIS own counsel from the
        panel of attorneys or otherwise.
       C. Duration and I11.ibstitution of appointments:
            As provided in paragraph (c) of section 2, a defendant for
         whom counsel is appointed hereunder shall be represented at every
         stage of the proceedings, from his initial appearance before the
         U.S. commissioner or district judge through appeal. If at any
         time after the appointment of counsel the district judge finds
         that the defendant is financially able to obtain counselor to make
,. 	     partial payment for his representation, the district judge may ter­
         minate the appointment of counselor he may direct that pay­
         ment be made to the appointed counselor to the bar association
         which made such appointed counsel available for appointment,
         or to the Legal Aid Society. Such payments shall be strictly
         controlled by the courtl to the end that payments to appointed
         counselor the bar aSSOCIation or the Legal Aid Society shall not
         exceed the maximum permitted by the act.
           H at any stage of the proceedings a district judge shall find
        that a defendant for whom counsel has not previously been ap­
         pointed under this plan is financially unable to pay counsel whom
34         JUDICIAL CONFE,RENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

     he has retained, the district judge may appoint the same counsel 

     or substitute counsel in the manner heremabove provided. The 

     district judge or the U.S. commissioner may, ill the interests of 

      justice, substitute one appointed counsel for another at any stage 

     of the proceedings. 

        In the event that a defendant is convicted following trial, coun­

     sel appointed hereunder shall advise the defendant of his right of 

     appeal and of his right to counsel on appeal. If requested to do 

     so by the defendant, counsel shall file a timely notice of appeal, 

     and he shall continue to represent the defendant unless, or until, 

     he is relieved by the court of appeals. 

        No counsel appointed hereunder shall seek or accept any fee
     from the defendant for whom he is appointed. If there should
     come to the knowledge of such counsel any information indicating
     that the defendant can make payment in whole or in part for legal
     services, it shall be his duty to report such informatIOn promptly
                                                                             '.
     to the court, so that appropriate action may be taken hereunder.
                  IV. SERVICES OTHER THAN COUNSEL

   Counsel (whether or not appointed under this plan) for a defendant
who is financially unable to obtain investigative, expert, or other serv­
ices necessary to an adequate defense in his case may request such serv­
ices in an ex parte application before a district judge. If, after appro­
priate inquiry (including consultation with the U.S. attorney if he
deems it adVlsable), the district judge shall find that the serVICes are
necessary and that the defendant is financially unable to obtain them,
he shall authorize defendant's counsel to obtain such services. The
statements made by the defendant 'upon such inquiry shall be made
either by affidavit sworn to before the district judge or by statement,
under oath, made in open court. If the district judge should find that
timely procurement of such services could not awaIt pri()r authoriza­
tion, he may, in the interests of justice, ratify such services after they
have been obtained,if he shall find that the defendant is financially
unable to pay for them, provided that ratification of services previously
incurred shall be given only in the most unusual situations.
       V. PAYMENT OF COUNSEL FEES AND FOR OTHER SERVIOES

   A. Payment of counsel fees for counsel appointed under this plan,
and for his expenses reasonably incurred, and for expenses for other
services incurred pursuant to article IV hereof, shall be made in ac­
cOI-dance with such rules and regulations as may be prescribed from
time to time by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (Ad­
ministrative O f f i c e ) . ·                                               "
   B. Any counsel appointed under the plan or the bar association or
the Legal Aid Society, as the case may 'be, who made him available
for appointment, may apply for payment of his counsel fees and his
expenses, reasonably incurred, WIthin 90 days following the conclu­
sion of his services. (Expenses reasonably incurred are limited to
out-of-pocket expenses and shall not include any allocations for gen­
eral office overhead, such as rent, telephone services, or secretarial
help.)
                     JUDICIAL 	 CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                         35
            C. Any counsel authorized to obtain investigatory, expert, or other
         services pursuant to article IV hereof (including cases where the ob­
         taining of such services was ratified by the court), or the bar asso­
         ciation or the Legal Aid Society, as the case may be, who made him
         available for appointment, may apply for payment or reimbursement
         of such expenses within 90 days following the conclusion of his serv­
         ices as counsel.
            D. Applications under paragraphs Band C of this article V shall
         be made ex parte to the district judge presiding in Crime, Part I.
         Each such application shall contain a statement of the services ren­
         dered a/ld the amount of time spent by counsel, an itemized list of his
         expenses, reasonably incurred, or, in applications under paragraph
         C, an itemized list of expenses incurred which have been authorized
.r 	     for payment or reimbursement. Any such application may be re­
         ferred by the district judge presiding in Crime, Part I, to the district
         judge who presided at the trial or to the district judge who appointed
         the applicant or who· authorized or ratified the incurring of the serv­
         ices if the district judge presiding in Crime, Part I, so detennines.
         Upon approval of any such application by a district judge, it shall
         be forwarded by the clerk to the Administrative Office for payment,
         except that an application under parwaph B hereof which is ap­
         proved in an amount in excess of the hmits provided in subdivision
          (d) of section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act because of extraordinary
         circumstances and in order to provide fair compensation for pro­
         tracted representation, shall be forwarded by the clerk to the chief
         judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, for his approval
  (,     prior to being forwarded to the Administrative Office.

               VI. AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE U.S. COURTS

           The authority conferred on the Director of the Administrative Office
         by the following resolutions of the Judicial Conference of the United
         States adopted January 13, 1965, is made part of this plan:
             (1) In his responsibility for supervision of payments from the appropriations
          under the act, the Director of the Administrative Office is authorized to adopt
          and use a system of central disbursement for all appropriated funds, requiring
          notill.caiton to the Administrative Office of every appointment of counsel and
         .authorization of other services as they are made; the transmission of vouchers
          to the Administrative Office for payment, containing adequate infonnation as to
          the nature and extent of services rendered, both in and out of court, and the
          expenses incurred, and with payments to be made directly from the Admin­
          istrative Office, rather than locally; and
             (2) The Director is further authorized under the supervision and direction
          of the Committee To Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, to request
          any other reports from a district court and from a judicial council in suClh form

     A SUGGESTED PLAN FOR THE U.S. DISTRICT CoURT FOR THE EASTERN
      DISTRICT OF LoUISIANA, PURSUANT TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF
      1964
     Prepared by Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Eastern District of
                              Louisiana
.!
                                      PREAMBLE
        The judges of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
     Louisiana, as required by the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C.
     3006A, with the approval of the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit,
     have adopted the following plan, applicable to both the New Orleans
     and Baton Rouge divisions, for furmshing representation for defend­
     ants charged with felonies or misdemeanors, other than petty offenses as
     defined in 18 U.S.C. 1, who are financially unable to obtain an adequate
     defense. The act does not apply in habeas corpus cases, in proceedings
     to vacate sentence brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255, or in any other J?ro­
     ceedings of a similar character, which is collateral to the origmal
     criminal case.
        Representation under this plan shall include counsel and investiga­
     tive, expert, and other services necessary to an adequate defense.
        The bar has traditionally represented defendants unable to pay for
     counsel, without compensation. Payment for representation provided
     by the act obviously does not comJ?ensate appomted attorneys in the
     accep.ted sense. The bar will contmue to perform such services pri­
     marIly as officers of the court, in keeping with the high traditions of the
     past, and with the knowledge that such services are rendered toward
     the realization of a lofty ideal, equality before the law for all men.
                              1.   PANEL OF ATTORNEYS
        The clerk of ~his court, under the direction, supervision, and with
     the approval of the court, shall prepare and maintain a panel of
     attorneys, competent to provide an adequate defense to defendants
     under the act. The clerk shall seek the advice and assistance of local
     bar associations in preparing the panel. Additions and deletions to
     the panel of attorneys may be made at any time by the court. A sepa­
     rate panel shall be kept for the New Orleans and the Baton Rouge dIvi­
     sions. Each judge and U.S. commissioner of the court shall be fur­
     nished by the clerk with copies of the panels of attorneys and with
     revisions thereof as made from time to time. The clerk shall also main­
     tain a list of appointments of counsel made by the U.S. commissioner
     and the judges of this court.
                                                                       37

                      2. APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

(a) 	Informing defendant of right to 1'epr'e8entation; determination of
      financial inability
   In every criminal case in which a defendant is charged with a felony
or a misdemeanor, other than a petty offense, and is not represented
by counsel, the U.S. commissioner or the court shall promptly advise
the defendant that he has the right to be represented by counsel and
that counsel will be appointed to represent hIm if he is financially un­
able to obtain counseL Unless the defendant waives the a'Ppointment of
counsel, the U.S. commissioner or the court shall appomt counsel to
represent him from the approved panel of attorneys, if satisfied after
appropriate inquiry that the defendant is financially unable to obtain
counsel and upon making a finding to that effect.
   Statements made by a defendant in such inquiry shall be either                 . l
under oath in open (,.,ourt or by affidavit verified by any person empow­           I
ered to 'ltdminister oaths.
   The judge shall make his own finding of the need to appoint counsel        ..    I
for a defendant, but he may base his finding upon the affidavit made
by the defendant before the commissioner. The approved standard
forms of the Administrative Office shall be used by the commissioner
and the court in such inquiry and for the order appointing counseL
   Where counsel is waived by a defendant, either before the C-ommis­
sioner or the- court, the waiver shall in all instances be made in writing,
signed by the defendant, on forms approved by the court.
   The commissioner shall inform the defendant that waiver of counsel
before the commissioner shall not prevent the defendant from request­
ing 'appointment of counsel 'before the court.
(b) 	Repre8entation at every stage of prooeedings
   A defendant for whom counsel has been appointed shall be repre­
sented at every stage of the proceedings, from his initial appewran~
before the U.S. commis;;ioner or court, through appeal, if any.
(c) 	 Separate omtnsel
   Separate counsel shall be appointed for defendants who have such
conflIcting interests that they cannot ~perly be represented by the
same counsel, or when other good cause IS shown.
(d) 	Defendant may not seleot oounsel
   No such defendant shall select his own counsel from the panel of
attorneys, or otherwise. The selection of counsel shall be the exclu­
sive responsibility of the U.S. commissioner or the judge, as the case
maybe.
(e) 	 Ree'-IJatrnining need for oounsel
                                                                              "
   The court may reexamine the need for counsel at any time a.fter
appointment has been made. If the judge finds that the defendant
is financially able to obtain counselor make partial payment for the
representation he shall terminate the appointment or authorize pay­
ment as provided in subsection (f) of the act, as the interests of justice
may dictate. If the judge finds that a defendant for whom counsel
has not previously been appointed is finan~ially unable to pay counsel
whom he has retamed, the judge shall appomt the same counselor new
counsel as provided in this plan.
          JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                   39
(f) Duration and 8ubstitution of oounsel
  Counsel appointed by a U.S. commissioner shall represent the de­
fendant in proceedings before the commissioner and until the funher
order of the judge. The judge may reappoint counsel appointed by
t.he commissioner for such defendant, or may appoint new counsel.
Such counsel shall thenceforth continue to represent the defendant
throughout the proceedings in district coun unless or until relieved
by order of the district coun, and thereafter through appeal, if any,
unless or until relieved by order of the coun of aI;>peals. The com­
missioner or the coun may, in the interests of justIce, substitute one
appointed counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings.
 (g) 	Inform'iJng oonvicted defendant of right to appeal and to rep­
   resentation on appeal
   In the event that a defendant is· convicted following trial, counsel
appointed hereunder shall advise the defendant of his right of appeal
 and of his right to counsel on appeal. If requested to do so by the
defendant, counsel shall file a tImely notice of appeal t and he shall
continue to represent the defendant unless, or until, he is relieved
by the court of appeals.
                  3 SERVICES OTHER THAN COUNSEL

   Counsel (whether or not appointed under this plan) for a defendant
who is financially unable to obtain investigative, expen, or other serv­
ices necessary to an adequate defense in his case may request them in
un ex parte application to the court. Upon finding, after appropri­
ate inquiry, that the services are necessary and that the defendant is
financially unable W obtain them, the coun shall authorize counsel to
obtain the services on behalf of the defendant. The coun may, in
its discretion, establish a limit on the amount to be expended for such
services. Inquiry should be made, however, to determine if reason­
able stipulations may be made to avoid expense. Statements made by
a defendant in such inquiry in support of his request shall be made
either by affidavit duly verified or under oath in open coun. The
court may, in the interests of justice, and upon a finding that timely
procurement of necessnry services could not await prior authorization,
ratify such services after they have been obtained, but such applica­
tions for the ratification of expenses incurred without prior court ap­
proval shall not be looked upon with favor except in most unusual
situations.
   The Commissioner may not authorize the obtaining of investigative,
expert, or other services.
4. PAYMENT FOR REPRESENTATION AND FOR SERVICES OTHER THAN COUNSEL

(a) Attorneys
  An attorney appointed pursuant to this plan shall, at the conclusion
of the representation or any segment thereof, be compensnted on sub­
mission of his claim in aceordance with rules, reg1l1ations and forms
prescribed by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and sup­
ported by a written detailed and itemized statement specIfying the
time expended, services rendered, and expenses incurred (but IlDt in­
cluding any allocated part of general office overhead) while the case
40        JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

was pending before the U.S. commissioner or court, and the compen­
sation and reimbursement applied for and received in the same.case
from any other source. The court shall, in each instance, fix the com­
pensation and reimbursement to be paid to the attorney. In extraor­
dinary circumstances, payment in excess of the limits for represen­
tation stated in paragraph (d) of the act may be made if the court
certifies that such payment is necessary to provide fair compensation
for protracted representation, and the amount of the excess payment
is approved by the chief judge of the fifth circuit.
 (b) Servwe8 other tlwn counBel
   The court shall determine and fix reasonable compensation for the
services and direct payment to the organization or person who ren­
dered them upon the filing of a claim for compensation supported by
an affidavit specifying the time expended, services rendered, and ex­
penses incurred on behalf of the defendant, and the compensation re­
ceived in the same care or for the same services from any other source.
 (c) 	 Timely 8u.bmissWn of claiJm,s                                         •
   Because the efficient administration of the act on a national basis re­
quires that claims for services and expenses be submitted for payment
as eXl?editiously as possihle, all persons having such claims shall timely
submIt them for prompt payment.
 (d) Payment8 from defendant
    Except as authorized or directed by the court, no appointed at­
 torney, and no person or organization authorized by the court to render
investigative, expert, or other services, may request or accept any pay­
 ment or promise of payment for assisting in the representation of a
defendant. Appointed counsel shall have the duty of reporting to the
court any situatlOn coming to his attention where a defendant appears
 to be a;ble to make payment in whole or in part for services in connec­
 tion with his defense.
 (e ) Forwarding apprfYIJed 8tatements for payment
    The clerk shall forthwith forward all approved statements to the 

 Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts for payment. 

                         5. RULES AND REPORTS

  The clerk is directed, on behalf of the court, to submit a report on 

the appointment of counsel to the Administrative Office of the U.S. 

Courts in such form and at such time as the Judicial Conference of

  MARYLAND, PuRsUANT      ro THE Cru.MlNAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964 AND
  SUGGESTED PROOEDURES UNDER THE PLAN

Prepared by Chief Judge RoszelC. Thomsen, District of Maryland

sentation,; as provided in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section
2, defendants in this court charged with felonies or misdemeanors
(other than petty offenses as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1) who are finan­
cially unable to obtain an adequate defense and for the furnishing of

of the several counties within the district are invited. to prepare and
to certify to this court, not later than May 1, 1965 and annually
thereafter) a list of attorneys who, in the opinion of the certifying
bar assoCIation, are competent to give adequate representation to
defendants under the act, and w"lw are willing to serve.
   After considering the lists so furnished and making such other
inquiry as the court may deem expedient, the court will establish and
approve a panel of attorneys on or before June 15, 1965. Additions
to and deletions from the panel of attorneys may be made from time

               n.   DETERMINATION OF NEED FOR OOUNSEL

  In every criminal case in which the defendant is charged with a
felony or a misdemeanor1 other than a petty offense, and appears
without counsel, the commIssioner or the court shall adVIse the defend­
ant that he has the right to be represented by counsel thrpughout the
                                                                 41
42         JUDICIAL CONFEHENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

case and that counsel will be appointed to represent him if he so
desires if he is financially unable to obtain counsel.
   Whenever the defendant states that he is fina.ncially unable to 0b­
tain (',ounsel and desires the appointment of counsel, if the case is then
pending before a commissioner, it shall be the duty of the cpmmis­
sioner to inquire into and to make a finding as to whether the defend­
ant is financially able to obtain counsel. If the case is not pending
before a commissi.oner, it shall be the duty of a judge to conduct such
inquiry and to make such finding.
   All statements made by a defendant in such an inquiry shall be
either (a) by affidavit sworn to before a judge, a court clerk, a com­
missioner, or a notary public, or (b) under oath in open court before
a judge.

that such defendant is financially unable to obtain counsel, he shall
appoint counsel for such defendant in the manner provided in article
III of this plan.
  The court may reexamine the need for appointed counsel at any
time, in accordance with paragraph (c) of section 2 of the act, and
section D, article III, of this plan.
                     III. APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

a. The oommisttioner
   In every crimina.1 case in which a defendant is cha-rged with a felony
 or misdemeanor, other tha.n a petty offense, and appears without
counsel before a commissioner, it is the duty of the commissioner not
only to advise the defenda.nt of his right to counsel 'before the com­
 missioner and throughout the case, but also promptly to appoint
counsel to represent the defendant if the commlssioner finds that the
defendant is financially unable to obtain an attorney, unless the de­
 fendant waives his right to be represented by counsel.
   The commissioner shall select and a.ppoint such counsel frOO! the
appropriate pa.nel approved by the court. The defendant shall not
have the right to select his appointed counsel from the panel of
attorneys or otherwise.
   Counsel appointed by a commissioner shall, unless excused by order
of court, contmue to act for the defenda.nt throughout the proceedings
in this court. In the event that a defendant is convicted following
trial, counsel appointed hereunder shall advise the defendant of his
right of appeal a.nd of his right to counsel on appeal. If requested to
do so by the defendant, counsel shall file a timely notice of a.ppeal,
a.nd he shall continue to represent the defendant unless, or until,
he is relieved by the court of appeals. If counsel appointed. by a. com­
missioner wishes to be relieved, he shall communicate his wish to the
court.
   The commissioner before whom a case is pending may, in the interest
of justice, substitute one appointed counsel for a.nother at any stage
of the proceedings before him.
   If the defendant is not represented by counsel before the commis­
sioner and waives his right to have appointed counsel, the commis­
sioner shalllresent the defendant a waIver of right to have appointed
counsel. I the defendant executes the waiver, the commIssioner
          JUDICIAL CONFIDRENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                   43
shall certify that fact in the record of the proceedings and shall
transmit the waiver to the clerk. If the defendant waives the right
to have .appointed counsel but refuses to execute such a waiver, the
conunissioner shall certify that fact in the record of proceedings.
If the defendant admits or the commissioner finds that the defendant
is financially able to obtain counsel but declines to do so, the com­
missioner shall certify that fact in the record of proceedings.
b. The clerk
   If counsel has not boon appointed by the commissioner or the
appointment of such counsel has been terminated by the court, and
the clerk learns from the report of the commisisoner, from the U.S.
attorney, from the defendant himself, or otherwise, that a defendant
desires to have counsel appointed for him, then­
        (a) If no affidavit or financial inability to em'Ploy counsel has
     been filed with the clerk, he shall promptly send to the defendant
     a form of affidavit, to be filled out by the defendant and returned
     to the clerk; or
        (b) If the notice to the clerk includes an affidavit of such
     financial inability to employ counselor as soon as the clerk rooei ves
     such an affidavit, the clerk shall promptly arrange for the a}?­
     pointment of counsel in the manner provided in section C of HilS
     article.
O. Thejudge
   Whenever the clerk fresents to a judge of this court a proposed order
for the appointment 0 counsel for a defendant, and the judge is satis­
fied that the defendant desires counsel and is financially unwble to em­
ploy counsel, the judge shall appoint counsel for him.
   If a judge, the clerk, the U.S. attorney, an appointed attorney, or a
representative of a bar association challenges the claimed financial
inability of a defendant to employ a lawyer, the determination of the
defendant's right to have appointed counsel shall be made by a judge
of this court.
   Whenever it shall appear to the presiding judge, at the time of ar­
raignment or at any other time, that a defendant is not represented
by counsel and has not voluntarily waived the assistance of counsel, the, '
judge shall determine whether such defendant is financially able to
obtain counsel and, if not, whether he wishes the judge to appoint
counsel for him. If the judge concludes that counsel should be ap­
pointed, such appointment will ordinarily be made from the appropri­
ate panel; provided, however, that in extraordinary situations, in the
interest of justice, the judge may appoint any member of the bar of
this court to represent such a defendant.
   The selection of such counsel is the province of the judge. The de­
fendant shall not have the right to select his appointed counsel from
the panel of attorneys or, otherwise.
   A judge may, in hIS discretion, assign two or more attorneys to refire­
sent a defendant or defendants as a team in a particular case, but
nothing herein shall require the judge to assign a team of attorneys in
lieu of the appointment of an individual attorney.
   Counsel appointed by a judge shall, unless excused by order of court,
continue to act for t,he defendant throughout the proceedings in this
44         JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

court. In the event that a defendant is convicted following trial, cmID­
sel appointed hereunder shall advise the defendant of his right of
appeal and of his right to counsel on appeaL If requested to do so by
the defendant, counsel shall file a timely notice of af.peal, and he shall
continue to represent the defendant unless, or untj , he is relieved by
the court of appeals.
    A judge may, in the interest of justice, substitute one appointed
counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings in this court.
D. Redetermination of need
    If at any stage of the proceeding, a judge shall find that a defendant
for whom counsel has not previously been appointed under this plan
but who has retained his own attorney is financially unable to provide
for his continued representation, the judge may appoint counsel for
such defendant. The court will ordinarily not appoint the same
attorney.
                                                                                 -.
     No appointed counsel may request or accept any payment or promise
of payment for assIsting in the representation of a defendant, unless
such payment is approved by order of court.
     If at any time after his appointment counsel should have reason to
believe that a defendant is financially able to obtain counselor to make
partial payment for counsel, he shall advise the court. The court will
then take appropriate action, which may include permitting assigned
couusel to continue to represent the defendant with part or all of the
cost of representation defrayed by such defendant.
     In such event, the amount so paid or payable by the defendant shall
be considered by the court in determining the total compensation to
be allowed to such attorney.
IV. I rllVestigative, e3)pM't,' and other services
     Counsel, whether or not appointed under this plan, for a defendant
who is financially unable to obtain investigative, expert, or other serv­
ices necessary for an adequate defense in his case may request such
services in an ex parte application before a judge. If, after appro­
priate inquiry, the judge shall find that the requested servi~s are
necessary and that the defendant is financially unable to obtain them,
he shall authorize defendant's counsel to obtain such services. The
judge may establish a limit on the amount which may be expended or
promised for such services.
     The statements made by or on behalf of the defendant in support of
the request shall be made either by affidavit sworn to before the clerk
or other appropriate officer, or under oath in open court. ~ the inter­
(',sf, of justIce, the judge may direct that such affidavit be sealed and the
information withheld from the public and the U.S. attorney.
     Applications for the ratification of expenses incurred without prior
court approval are not looked upon with favor and will not be ap­               '1

proved except in most unusual situatious.
 V. Payment of fees to appointed oounsel and for other 8ervices
     Payment of fees and expenses to counsel appointed under this plan
and payment for other services incurred pursuant to article IV hereof
shall be made in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be
 prescribed from time to time by the Administrative Office of the U.S.
 Courts.

                    III. APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

A. The commiBsioner
   After advising a defendant of the charge against him a.nd the nature
of the proceeding before the commissioner, and warning him of pos­
sible self-incrimination: the commissioner shall 'fl.dvise the defendant
of his right to counsel before the commissioner as well as at his tria.l
and of the commissioner's willingness to appoint counsel to represent
the defendant if the defendant so desires but is financially una.ble to
obtain counsel.
   A defendant may sta.te tha.t he wishes counsel to be a.Pp<?inted to
represent him before the commissioner or that he wishes tI'lru counsel
  46         JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

  to be appointed to represent him thereafter, or both. If a defendwt 

  requests the appointment of counsel for either or both {>urp0se8, the 

  commissioner shall obtain from the defendant an affidaVIt on form 1, 

  attached hereto, or in substantial accordance therewith, unlffiS the cir· 

  cumstances indicate that form 3 should be used. 

     If the defendant requests the appointment of counsel to represent 

  him before the commissioner, the commissioner shall consider the affi­

  davit and make such further inquiry as he deems necessary or propel'. 

  If, on the basis of such inquiry, the commissioner finds that the de­

  fendant is financially unable to obtain counsel, he shall arpointcounsel 

  to represent the defendant from the general subpane approved by 

, the court, or from the subpanel for the county in which the commis­
  sioner is sitting or the subpanel for the county in which the defendant
  resides.
     The selection of such oounsel is the province of the commissioner.
  The defendant shall not have the right to select his appointed counsel
  from the panel of attorneys or otherwise.
     If counsel appointed by a commissioner wishes to be relieved, he           ..
  should communicate his wish to the court.
     A form of waiver of right to have appointed counsel before the
  commissioner is attached hereto as form A. A form of certification
  by the commissioner, if the defendant has executed a waiver of right
  to have appointed counsel, is a part of form A. A form of certification
  by the commissioner, if the defendant has waived the right to have
  appointed counsel but has refused to execute a written waiver, is
  attached hereto as form B. A form of certification by the commissioner
  if the defendant admits or the commissioner finds that the defendant
  is financially able to obtain counsel but declines to do so is attached
  hereto as form C.
    If a defendant indicates to the commissioner that he does not yet
  know whether he will wish trial counsel to be appointed, the commis­
  sioner shall give the defendant two copies of the affidavit, form 3, and
  shall advise the defendant that if he decides to request the appointment
  of counsel, he should mail or deliver an executed copy of the affidavit
  to the clerk of the court.
     The commissioner is required by rule 5(c), F.R. Crim. P., to report
  to the clerk forthwith in writing the names of all defendants whom he
  has held for action of the pnd jury, stating whether they have been
  released on bail or commItted to custody. If the commissioner has
  appointed counsel for the defendant, he shall attach to his report the
  original order appointing such counsel. If the defendant waived coun­
  sel before the commissioner, the commissioner shall so report to the
  court and shall attach to his report any waiver which may have been
  executed by the defendant. If the defendant waived counsel before
  the commissioner but requested that trial counsel be appointed for him,       ''/
  the commissioner shall attach to his report any affidavit which may
  have been executed by the defendant.
 .B. The clerk and the U.S. attorney 

    The clerk shall use the form of affidavit attached hereto as form 3. 

  provided that when the charge against the defendwt is theft, robbery, 

  or other offense where the defendant might be in possession of illegally 

  acquired property, the clerk should direct the defendant to state his 

  assets as of the day before the alleged commission of the offense. 

           JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                   47
   If the U.S. attorney learns that a defendant wishes to have trial
counsel appointed for him by the court, he shall promptly communicate
 this fact to the clerk.
   The clerk shall deliver to each appointed counsel a checklist, the
 form for which is attached to this plan as form D.
   A copy of the order appointing counsel shall be delivered promptly
 to the defendant and to the appointed attorney and shall be accom­
panied by a direction that if the defendant is on bailor makes bail he
shall contact his trial counsel within 3 days, and that failure to do so
 may result in the forfeiture of his bail and his commitment to custody.
 O. The judge
    (1) Appointment of cO'Il/Mel f'l'rnn generalsubpanel.-Wheneve:t: an
unchallenged affidavit discloses that the defendant is financially unable
to hire a lawyer and is a resident (a) of Baltimore City or (b) a State
other than Maryland or (c) a Maryland county whose bar association
is not participating in this plan, the clerk shall, in rotation, select a
lawyer to represent the defendant from the general subpanel estab­
lished pursuant to article I of this plan, after having ascertained the
availability of the lawyer he recommends, and shall submit to a judge
of this court an order appointing the selected lawyer to represent such
defendant. The judge shall have the right to reject any lawyer selected
by the clerk. If the judge does so reject, he may appoint any member
of the bar of this court to represent such defendant or he may direct
the clerk to select the next available lawyer on the subpanel. This pro­
cedure shall be repeated, if necessary, until an appointment is made
by the judge.
   After the order of appointment has been signed, the clerk shall
forthwith notify the lawyer named therein, and shall promptly inform
the defendant and the U.S. attorney of the name, address, and tele­
phone number of the appointed lawyer..                     .
   (2) Appointment of county lawyers.-Whenever an unchallenged
affidavit discloses that the defendant is financially unable to hire a
lawyer and is a resident of a county in this district whose bar associa­
tion is participating in the plan, the clerk shall, from the subpanel of
lawyers for that county, in rotation, recommend to a jud~ a lawyer
to represent the defendant, after ascertaining the availability of the
lawyer for appointment. The judge sha.l1 have the right to reject
the lawyer selected by the clerk. If the judge does so reject, the clerk
shall select the next available lawyer on the subpanel. This procedure
shall be repeated, if necessary, until an appointment is made by the
judge; provided that, in the interest of justice, the judge ma.y appoint
any member of the bar of this court to represent such defendant. .
   After the order of appointment has been signed, the clerk shall
forthwith notify the la'!yer named therein and shall promptly inform
the defendant and the U.S. attorney of the name, addreSS, 'and tele­
phone number of the appointed lawyer.
D. Redetermination of need
   See forms 6 and 7.
48        JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

           IV. INVESTIGATIVE, EXPERT, AND OTHER SERVICES

   Inquiry should ordinarily be mlLde whether or not the matter in­
volved in the application for investi~ative, expert, or other services
can reasonably be stipulated, or the mformation otherwise be made
available to the defendant, to save time or to avoid the expense of
authorizing such services; provided, however, that in the interest of
justice the judge may authorize such services without such inquiry.
  Form 8 shall be used unless form 10 is applicable. ApplicatIOns for
the ratification of expenses incurred without prior court approval are
not looked upon with faV'Or and will not be approved except in most
unusual situations.
  A commissioner has no power to authorize a defendant or his counsel
to obtain such services. All requests therefor shall be addressed to a
judge.
  V. PAYMENT OF FEES TO APPOINTED COUNSEL AND FOR OTHER SERVICES

   Each appointed attorney shall maintain individual records indi­
cating the time expended on each case, the nature of the services per­
formed, and the expenses incurred. The record should contain the
names and addresses of persons interviewed or attempted to be inter­
viewed.
   Counsel appointed pursuant to the plan and counsel authorized to
obtain investigative, expert1 or other services may apply for payment
of such counsel fees and/or tor payment of or reimbusment for such ex­
penses. Such applications shall be in writing and verified by the
person who furnIshed such investigative, expert, or other services and
shall be made to the judge who'presided at the trial" the judge who
appointed the applicant, or the Judge who authorized the incurring
of the services. Each such application shall contain a statement of
the services rendered and the amount of time spent by counsel, together
with an itemized list of any expenses authorized and incurred. In
listing the time required for legal research, the application shall state
the nature of the legal J>roblems. Upon approval of any such appli­
cation by a judge, it shall be forwarded by the clerk to the Administra.­
tive Office of the U.S. Courts for payment. Forms 4, 5 (if applicable),
and 9 shall be used.
   Only in exceptional cases will interim a.llowances be made to attor­
neys for services performed or expenses incurred, although interim
orders may be entered (a) for unusual expenses incurred by attorneys
or (0) for investigative, expert, or other expenses necessary for an
adequate defense. Ordinarily, orders directing the payment of com­
pensation will be entered upon the conclusion of the services.
   Irrespective of the number of attorneys representing a defendant         ''\'

by appointment, only one claim for compensation will be recognized
as to anyone defendant in a case. Whenever a team of attorneys is
designated, they may make their own arrangements with respeet to
the division of any fee and the nature of the work to be performed by
each attorney. The court may resolve any disagreement between at­
torneys as to the division of compensation.
   The commissioner has no authority to authorize the payment of
compensation to counsel, expenses, or expert services.

 Prepared by Judge Homer Thornberry, Western District of Texas
     This (>lan provides for representation by private attorneys, as de­
  scribed m paragraph (a) (1) of section 2 of the &Ct.
     Lawyers who are selected to partici}!ate in this plan do so in ful­
  fillment of their professional responslbility as officers of the court,
  and the amount of compensation provided for in no respect diminishes
  such responsibility.      '--'
 1. 	 Panel of att()"J'7WYs
     A separate panel of atfurneys shall be designated for each of the
  divisions of the U.S. District Court for the - - District of ~
  and shall consist of lawyers who are qualified and competent to
 provide an adequate defense for defendants under the act. It shall
  be designated and a(>proved by the U.S. district judge responsible
  for the particular dlvision to which the panel is furnished. The
  judge may make additions to and deletions from the panel at any
  time. The clerk of the court will maiIltain the panel of attorneys
  under the direction, supervision, and with the approval of the judge,
  and will furnish the Judge and "the U.S. commIssioners withm the
  division copies of the panel of attorneys and with revisions thereof as
  made from time to time.
  2. 	 (a) Right of defendant to (JountJel
     When it appears to a judge or U.S. commissioner that a defendant
  is not represented by counsel, the defendant, shall be promptly in-       ~
  formed by the commissioner or the judge of his right to be represented
  by counsel at every stage of the proceedin~s against him, and that
  counsel will be appointed to represent him If he is financially unable
 to obtain counseL
   (b) 	 Determination of need for (JQWlUJeZ
     Whenever such a defendant states that he is financially unabl~ to
" obtain counsel and requests the appointment of counsel, it shall be the
 duty of the district judge or the U.S. commissioner, as the case may be,
  to inquire into and to make a finding as to whether such defendant is
  financially able to obtain coUnsel. Statements made by such defend­
  ant in such inquiry may be under oath in open court or by affidavit
  sworn to before the district judge or the commissioner.
  (c) 	 A ppointment of (JountJel
     If the defendant in his initial appearance before the commissioner
  requests appointment of counsel and determination is made t1ui.the
  is entitled to the appointment of counsel, the commissioner shall im­
  mediately notify the clerk of the court, who in turn will inform the

   event the clerk of the court or the judge are not available for any
   reason, the Commissioner shall proceed wIthout delay to ap,{lOint coun­
  sel from the panel to represent the defendant in the proceedmgs before
  the U.S. commissioner and shall immediately notify the clerk of the
   court that such counsel has been appointed to represent the defendant.
     If the defendant in his initial appearance before the court is without
  counsel, the judge shall advise the defendant of his right to counsel,
  in accordance WIth paragraph 2(a) of this plan, and if the defendant
  then requests appointment of counsel, the judge shall proceed to make
  a determination of the defendant's need for counsel in accordance with
  paragraph 2(b) of this plan. If the judge finds that the defendant is
  financially unable to obtain counsel, the judge shall appoint counsel
, from the panel to represent the defendant III all proceedings before the
  court.
   (d) Duration and substitution of oounsel
     When counsel has been appointed by. the U.S. commissioner, such
  counsel will represent the defendant in proceedings before the U.S.
  commissioner and in all subsequent proceedings untll relieved by order
  of the court. The court may, in the interest of justice, substitute one
  appointed counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings.
     In the event that a defendant is,. convicted following trIal, counsel
  appointed hereunder shall advise the defendant of his right of appeal
  and of his right to counsel on appeal. If requested to do so by the
  defendant, counsel shall file a timely notice of appeal, and he shall
  continue to represent the defendant unless, or until, he is relieved by the
  court of appeals.
  (e ) 	 Waiver of right to counsel
     The commissioner shall notify the clerk in writing if the defendant
  waives his right to counsel. All waivers of counsel before the commis­
 sioner shall be in writing and signed by the defendant. Such waivers
  shall be filed among the papers in the case. If the defendant waives
  his right to counsel before the commissioner but refuses to sign the
 written waiver, then the commissioner shall certify in writing to the
  clerk of the court that the defendant has been informed of all of his
 rights to counsel in the proceedings against him and has waived such
  rights but has refused to sign the written waiver.
     In the event the defendant waives counsel before the commissioner,
 the commissioner shall inform the defendant that such waiver will not
  prevent the defendant from requesting appointment of counsel before
  the court.
  (f) Defendant may not seleot oounsel
     No defendant shall have the right to select his own counsel under this
  plan, but such selection shall be the exclusive responsibility of the
 court or commissioner, as the case may be.
  (g) 	Separateoounsel
     Separate counsel shall be appointed for defendants who have such
 conflIcting interests that they cannot l»roperly be represented by the
  same counsel, or when other good canse IS shown.

       (h) 	0 ourt may reexamine need for oounsel
          The court may reexamine the need for counsel at any time. If at
       any time after the appointment of counsel, the judge finds that the
       defendant is financially able to employ counsel, or to make partial pay­
       ment for his representation, the judge may terminate the appointment
       or he may direct that such partial payment be made to the appointed
       counsel as provided in the act.
        (i) 	Notice to defendant and oO'/Jllt8el
          When counsel is appointed to represent a defendant, the clerk shall
       immediately notify the lawyer and the defendant, and both the lawyer
       and the defendant will be Instructed to contact each other promptly.
       3. Services other than oounsel
          If counsel for a defendant believes it necessary to obtain investi­
       gative, expert, or other services necessary to an adequate defense and
       the defendant is financially unable to incur the expense for such
       services, he shall petition the court for permission to incur such ex­
       penses, setting forth the necessity, the person or persons to be,engaged,
       and the estimated amount of such expenses made by the person or per­
       sons to be engaged, submitting an appropriate order. The court may
       order a hearing upon the petition, and upon finding that the services
       are necessary and that the defendant is financially unable to obtain
       them, the court shall authorize counsel to obtain such services. Any
       claim for compensation for such services shall be filed by defendant's
       attorney and shall be supported by an affidavit by the person or per­
       sons furnishing the service, specifying the time expended, services ren­
       dered, and expenses incurred on behalf of the defendant. All such
       claims must be approved by the court.
       4. Oompensation of oounsel
          When an attorney is appointed by the court to represent a defend­
       ant, he shall keep a record of the hours spent in court and out of court
       in working on his appointed case. At the completion of his case be­
       fore the U.S. district court, the appointed counsel shall complete all
       forms required by the court or the Administative Office of the U.S.
       Courts and file his claim for compensation and reimbursement. This
       claim must be suppo~d by a written statement specifying the time
       expended, services rendered, expenses incurred, and the compensation
       and reimbursement applied for and received in the same case from any
       other source, while the case was pending before the U.S. commis­
       sioner and the U.S. district court. The court, after this presentation,
       shall fix the compensation and reimbursement to be paid to the attor·
       ney.
          Except as authorized or directed by the court, no appointed attor­
,. 	   ney and no person or organization authorized by the court to render
       investigative, expert, or other services may request or accept any pay­
       ment or promise of payment from any other source for representing or
       assisting in the representation of a defendant.

A   SUGGESTED PLAN FOR A U.S. DISTRICT COURT, PURSUANT TO THE
                 CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964

    Prepared by   Jud~e   Wade A. McCree, Jr., Eastern District of 

                               Michigan 

                              INTRODUCTION

   This suggest.ed plan was prepared at the direction of the Committee
of the J udlCial Conference To Implement the Criminal Justice Act
of 1964 for a dist.rict having characteristics similar to those of the
Eastern District of Michigan. This draft has been discussed with
the judges of that district, but it has not been submitted to them for
final approval and adoption.
   The relevant characteristics of our district are thought to be the
following: The Eastern District of Michigan is a multiple-judge court
served by eight judges. The district has a Northern and Southern
Division with seven Judges serving regularly in the Southern Division
and one, by designation, serving in the Northern Division. The prin­
cipal place of holding court in the Southern Division is Detroit, which
is the largest metropolitan area involved. Court is also held in Flint,
Mich., a CIty of approximately 200,000 people, and this Southern Divi­
sion facility is presided over by the judge designated to sit in the
Northern Division. Court is held in the Northern Division in Bay
City, Mich., a city ap~roximately half the size of Flint. In the
Detroit facility, commIssioners are rarely utilized and only on an
emergency basis when there are no judges available. CommIssioners
are utilized to a greater extent at Flint and in the Northern Division,
although the judge who presides over those facilities frequently
conducts arraignments.
   The practice in Detroit is as follows: All criminal cases not at issue
and t.herefore not assigned to a particular judge comprise the mis­
cellaneous criminal docket over which the several judges preside in
rotation for 1 week's duration. This docket is heard twice daily at
11 a.m. and 3 p.m. at which hours the regular trial work of the judge
involved is interrupted. All arraignments on complaint and warrant
and upon indictment or information are handled by the judge at
one of these daily sessions. More than 75 percent of all defendants
are released on bail without surety with the consequence that we do
not have a serious problem of defendants in jail awaiting further
proceedings. A weekly jail inventory is furnished by the marshal to
each judge so that the court may be advised of persons detained await.
ing further criminal proceedings. We have not experienced difficulty
in obtaining adequate volunteer counsel under the present system
which affords no compensation to the lawyer.
   The judge who sits in Flint. and in the Northern Division, of neces­
sity, relies to some extent upon commissioners, although he conducts
                                                                 61
62         JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

as many arraignments personally as his availibility permits. The
same bail philosophy is followed by him, and he has encountered rela­
tively few problems of persons in custody awaiting further proceed­
ings and relatively little difficulty in obtaining volunteer counsel to
represent indigent defendants.
   Michigan has an integrated State bar which has a standing com­
mittee to maintain liaison with local bar associations which are active
and interested in participating in a program to implement the Crim­
inal Justice Act of 1964.
                         1. PANEL OF ATTORNEYS

   The several bar associations recognized by the State Bar of Michigan
in the counties comprising the Eastern District of Michigan are in­
vited to submit to the chief judge of the district and to the judge desig­
nated to sit in the Northern Division, in the case of counties located
within such division, a list of lawyers who have been admitted to
practice in the u:.S. district court and who are desirous of and are          "
deemed qualified to represent defendants who are financially unable
to obtain an adequate defense. Such list shall be furnished on the
attached form (a) and shall supply the information required thereon.
Such list shall be furnished on or before - - , 1965, and shall be sup­
plemented from time to time as requested by the court. From the list
so furnished, the court shall establish a panel of attorneys on or before
- - - , 1965. Additions to and deletions from the panel of attorneys
may be made from time to time by the court as the interests of justiCll
require. A copy of the panel shall be furnished to each judge and
U.S. commissioner in the district.
  2. 	DETERMINATION OF NEED FOR APPOINTED COUNSEL AND WAIVER OF
                              COUNSEL

   The judge or commissioner before whom the defendant first appears
in a criminal proceeding shall explain to each defendant not repre­
sented his right to counsel and shall make appropriate inquiry as to
defendant's desire for appointment of counsel if he professes financial           I

inability to obtain same. If defendant, after such explanation, de­               1
sires to waive counsel, a written waiver shall be evidenced by form
(b). If a defendant who refuses counsel declines to sign a waiver                 I
of counsel, the commissioner shall certify to such refusal and the court
shall cause a docket entry to be made evidencing such refusal of coun­        ~   I
sel. If a defendant expresses the desire for appointed. counsel, the
court shall examine him upon the record concerning his financial abil­
ity or the commissioner shall ascertaip. the pertinent information and
                                                                                  I

cause the defendant to execute an affidavit evidencing same. on CJA
form 1 or 3, in the appropriate instance. The court or commissioner, if
satisfied of defendant's financial inability, shall, without delay, appoint
                                                                                  I

                                                                                  I

counsel from the panel, utilizing OJA form 1 or 2.
  If counsel is desired, a date for preliminary examination will be
set and counsel, at the time of appomtment, shall be notified of such
                                                                                  i

date so that it may be utilized or waived.
   At every succeeding appearance, unrepresented defendants shall
again be advised fully of the right to counsel and the procedures set
forth above shall be followed in the appropriate instance.
          JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                      63
                   3. DUTIES OF APPOINTED ATTORNEY

   Every attorney appointed pursuant to this plan shall represent the
defendant at every stage of the proceeding unless rermitted to with­
draw by order of the court or unless other counse is substituted for
him by the court for good cause.
  If at any time after his appointment counsel shall have reason to
believe that the defendant is financially able to obtain counselor to
make partial payment for counsel, he shall advise the court, which will
take approprIate action, which may include permitting assigned coun­
sel to continue to represent the defendant with part of the cost of rep­
resentation defrayed 'by such defendant.
   In the event that a defendant is convicted following trial, counsel
appointed hereunder shall advise the defendant of his right of appeal
and of his right to counsel on appeal. If requested to do so by the
defendant, counsel shall file a timely notice of ap-peal, and he shall con­
tinue to represent the defendant unless, or untIl, he is relieved by the
court of appeals.
                   4. SERVICES OTHER THAN COUNSEL

   Counsel, whether or not appointed under this plan, for a defendant
who is financially unable to obtain investigative services necessary to
an adequate defense, may request such servICes in an ex parte applica­
tion on CJA form 8 but onlY' before a district judge. If after appro­
priate inquiry the judge shall find that the services are necessary and
that the defendant is financially unable to obtain them, the court may
authorize counsel to obtain the services on behalf of the defendant and
shall establish a limit on the amount which may be expended or
promised for such services.
   Application for ratification of services obtained without prior au­
thorIzation shall be made at the earliest possible opportunity after
such services have been contracted for, on CJA form 10, supported by
affidavit specifying the time expended, services rendered and expenses
incurred on behalf of the defendant and the compensation received
in the same case or for the same services from any other source. The
court may require other and further justification for such services as
may be desired for its determination.
   5. PAYMENT OF COUNSEL AND FOR SERVICES <Yl'HER THAN COUNSEL

   Every request for payment shall be submitted in accordance with
such rules and regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by
the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and shall be approved
by the judge before it shall be forwarded by the clerk to the Adminis­
trative Office of the U.S. Courts for payment.
                                6. POLICY

  Lawyers who participate in this plan do so in fulfillment of their
professional responsibility as officers of the court and the amount of
eompensation provided herein in no respect diminishes such responsi­
bility.
   This plan shall be administered to carry out the purposes of the
Criminal Justice Act of 1964.

Criminal Justice Act provides for limited compensation, there is a
great element of public service on the part of attorneys in volunteering
to serve on these panels.
  . Attorneys who participate in this plan do so in fulfillment of their
professional responsibility as officers of the court, and the compen­
sation provided for in no respect diminishes such responsibility. The
judges are confident that lawyers will respond as usual in the splendid
tradition of the American bar.
   2. General panel8.-General panels of attorneys available for ap­
pointment by U.S. district judges and commissioners in Los Angeles,
San Dies-o, and Fresno (three places for holding court in the district)

   number and type of the case. 

      5. Approval by judge of general panel.-Such general panel, when 

   prepared by the clerk, shall be submitted for approval, respectively, 

   to the chief judge in Los Angeles and to the judge in Fresno and the 

   judge senior in San Diego for approval. 

     6. Additions to and deleti0n8 from general panel.-The chief judge 

   in Los Angeles and the judge in Fresno and the judge senior in San 

   Diego may add names to or strike names from the respective general

  Fresno, and San Diego shall be requested to set up advisory panels of 

  experienced criminal lawyers who will be available without fee for 

  the purpose of advice and consultation to the regular members of the 

  general panel. 

     9. Order of appointment.-The appointments need not be made in 

  order, but the judge and commissioner will take into account the na­

  ture and difficulty of the case and the experience and qualifications 

  of the lawyer to be appointed.

    3. Approval of (Jommisisoner's panels.-The commissioner will sub­
 mit the commissioner's panel to the chief judge, or to a judge desig­
nated by the chief judge, for approval. Names may be added or de­
leted.
    4. Supplementing commissioners' panel.-The commissioner's panel
may. be supplemented from time to time by the order of the chief Judge

shall be forthwith arraigned whether counsel, available for appoint­
ment, is present or not.

sioner, sign it, and inail it to the clerko! the place whe.re trial will

     ment of the defendant after indictment.

"§ 3006A. Adequa,te repre8entation of defendant8
   "(a) CHOICE OF PLAN.-Each United States district court, with the
approval of the judicial council of the circuit, shall place in operation
throughout the district a plan for furnishing representation for de­
fendants charged with felonies or misdemeanors, other than petty
offenses as defined in section 1 of this title, who are financially unable
to obtain an adequate defense. Representation under each plan shall
include counsel and investigative, ex}?ert, and other services necessary
to an adequate defense. The proviSIon for counsel under each plan
shall conform to one of the following:
         " (1) Representation by private attorneys;
         "(2) Representatjion by attorneys furnished by a bar associa­
      tion or a legal aid agency; or
         "(3) Representation according to a plan containing It combina­
      tion of the foregoing.
Prior to approving the plan for a district, the judicial council of the
circuit shall supplement the plan with prov;isions for the representa­
tion on appeal of defendants financially unable to obtain representa­
tion. Consistent with the provisions of this section, the district court
may modify a plan at any time with the approval of the judic,ial coun­
cil of thecircUlt;it shall modify the plan when directed by the judicial
council of the circuit. The district court shall notify the Administra­
tive Office of the United States Courts of modifications in its plan.
   " (b) APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL.-In every criminal case in which
the defendant is charged with a felony or a misdemeanor, other than
a petty offense, and appears without counsel, the United States com­
mIssioner or the court shall advise the defendant that he has the right
to be represented by counsel and that counsel will be appointed to
represent him if he IS financially unable to obtain counsel. Unless the
defendant waives the a}?pointment of counsel, the United States com­
missioner or the court, 1f satisfied after appropriate inquiry that the
defendant is financially unable to obtain counsel, shall appoint counsel
to represent him. The United States commissioner or the court shall
                                                                      75
76         JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

 appoint separate counsel for defendants who have such conflicting
 interests that they cannot properly be represented by the same counsel,
 or when other good cause is shown. Counsel appointed by the United
 States commissioner or a judge of the district court shall be selected
 from a panel of attorneys designated or approved by the district court.
    "(c) DUR.>\:nON AND SUBSTITUTION OF ArpOINTMENTS.-A defend­
'ant for whom counsel is appointed shall be represented at every stage
of the 'proceedings from his initial appearance before the United States
 co~mlssioner or court through appeal. If at any time after the ap­
 pOllltment of counsel the court having jurisdiction of the case finds
that the defendant is financially able to obtain counselor to make
 partialrayment for the rel?resentation, he may terminate the appoint­
ment 0 counselor authorIze payment as provided in subsection (f),
'U.s the interests of justice may dictate. If at any sta~e of the proceed­
ill b>13, including an appeal, the court having jurisdIction of the case
 finds that the defendant is financially unable to pay counsel whom he
 had retained, the court may appoint counsel as provided in subsection
 (b) and authorize payment as provided in subsection (d), as the
 interests of justice may dictate. The United States commissioner or
the court may, in the interests of justice, substitute one appointed
counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings.
    "(d) PAYMENT FOR REPRESENTATION.-An attorney appointed pur­
 sualIt to this section, or a bar association or legal aid agency which
 made an attorney available for appointment, shall, at the conClusion
of the representation or any segment thereof, be compensated at a
 rate not exceeding $15 per hour for time expended in court or before
a United States commissioner, and $10 per hour for time reasonably
expended out of court, and shall be reimbursed for expenses reasonably
incurred. A separate claim for compensation and reimbursement
shall be made to the district court for representation before the United
States commissioner or that court, and to each appellate court before
which the attorney represented the defendant. Each claim shall be
supported by a \\Titten s~atement specifying the tinie expended1 serv­
ices rendered, and expenses incurred \vhile the case was pending before
the United States commissioner or court, and the compensatlOn and
reimbursement applied for or received in the same case from any
other source. The court shall, in each instance, fix the compensation
and reimbursement to be paid to the attorney, bar association ortega}
aid agency. For representation of a defendant before the United
States commissioner and the district court, the compensatiO'n to be
paid to' ~n attorney, or to a bar associatiO'n or legal aid ag:ency !O'r

one or mO're felonies are charged, and $300 in a case in which only
misdemeanors are charged. In extraordinary circumstances, payment
in excess of the limits stated herein may be made if the ,distrIct court
certifies that such payment is necessary to' provide fair compensation
for protracted representation, and the amount of the excess payment
is approved by the chief judge of the circuit. For representation O'f a
defendant in an appellate 'CO'urt, the compensation to be paid to' an
attO'rney, O'r to a bar assO'ciatiO'n or legaL aid agency for the services

    " (e) SERVICES OTHER THAN COUNSEL.-Counsel for a defendant
 who is financially unable to obtain investigative, expert, or other
 services necessary to an adequate defense in his case may request them
 in an ex parte applic'ation. Upon finding, after appropriate inquiry
 in an ex parte proceeding, that the services. are necessary and that the
 defendant is financially unable to obtain them, the court shall authoriz8'
 counsel to obblin the services on behalf of the defendant. The court
 may, in the interests of justice, and upon a finding that timely procure­
 ment of necessary services could not await prior authorization, ratify
 such services after they have been obtained. The court shall determine
 reasonable compensation for the services and direct payment to the
 organization or person who rendered them upon the filing of a claim
 for compensation supported by an affidavit specifying the time ex­
 pended, services rendered, and expenses incurred on behalf of the
 defendant, and the compensatiun received in the same case or for the
 same services from any other source. The compensation to be paid to
 a person for such service rendered by him to a defendant under this
 subsection, or to be paid to an organization for such services rendered

 ment for expenses reasonably incurred.

 attorney, to the bar association or legal aid agency which made the
 attorney available for appointment, to any person or organization
authorized pursuant to subsection (e) to render investigative, expert,
or other services, or to the court for deposit in the Treasury as a reim­
 bursement to the appropriation, current at the time of payment,

                 ACT OF 1964
           ~IINUTFA3 OI<' THE MEETING OF OCTOBER    17, 1964
   The Committee To Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 con­
vened at the call of the Chairman, Judge Hastings, a.t the Federal
courthouse in San Francisco, Calif., on October 17, 1964, at 9 a.m.
The following members of the Committee were in attendance:
    . Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman
       Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen
       Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah
       Judge Hobert A. Ainsworth, Jr.
       Judge Dudley Bonsal
       Judge James M. Carter

       Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen
       .Judge Homer Thornberry
   Warren Olney III, Direetor of the Administrative Office; James

Joseph F. Spaniol, .Jr., of the Administrative Office, were also in
attendanee.
                      REMARKS OF THE CHAIRMAN

  Judge Hastings reviewed briefly the history of the Criminal Justice
Act of 1964 and outlined the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Com­
mitt~ appointed to develop rules, procedures, and guidelines for an
assigned cOlllsel system. The policy recommendations of the Ad Hoc
Committee, which were approved hy the Judicial Conference, in­
cluded the following:
   (1) The central disbursement of funds.
   (2) The administration of the Criminal Justice Act through !l.
framework of boards of advisers to the judicial councils of the circuits,
assisted by full-time, compensated officers. (Judge Hastings noted that
the Committee might undertake to define the duties of such a com­
pensated officer and that these duties might include such things as
(a) establishing and maintaining rosters of attorneys, (b) the coor­
dination of investigative services, (c) assistance to the Administrative
Office, and (d) assistance in enlisting the support of the organized
~~)                                                                     .
  (3) That the chief judge of each circuit call a meeting of the chief
judges of the district courts in his circuit to consider the problems of
the administration of the Criminal Justice Actt the urgency of develop­
ing I?ractical andooceptab~e plans in each dIstrict, ways and means
of stImulating the interest and securing the support and cooperation
of the bar * * * and to make plans for again convening to act asa
panel of jud~es to appoint from the bar an appropriate board of ad­
visers to the Judicial council. (Judge Hastings pointed to the need for
                                                                 79

care in the preparation of a plan by each district court and emphasized
that the responsibility for developing plans rests with the district
courts. He suggested that the Committee should not usurp these
powers and responsibilities, but pointed out that the Committee does
have the obligation to develop rules and regulations for the considera­
tion of the Judicial Conference. The rules and regulations certainly
should contain provisions that would offer protectlon to the district
judge and relieve him insofar as possible from the burden of admin­
Istration. Judge Hastings noted also that the circuits are now looking
to the Committee for gmdelines in developing standards and rules to
which all district court plans might conform and expect the Com­
mittee to be of assistance to the district courts in the development of
their plans. Many judges have already made inquiries. He added
that any rules developed by the Committee should distinguish between          •
                                                                                      !
                                                                                      I
problems such as standards for the determination of indigency or
financial inability to obtain an adequate defense, which can be handled
on the national level and problems which will vary from court to
court and thus can be handled only at the local level. )                      . I
                                                                                      I
                                                                                      I
                            APPROPRIATIONS                                            j
   Judge Hastings explained that upon the recommendation of the
Ad Hoc Committee and the Budget Committee, t.he Judicial Confer­
ence had approved a budget request of $7,500,000 for the first year's
                                                                                      II 

operation under the act. This budget contemplates that there will be
more appointments of counsel in appropriate cases as a result of the
Criminal Justice Act, more trials, and more appointments of counsel
at the U.S. commissioner level. Thus the budget request is more than
twice the $3,500,000 cost figure submitted by the Attorney General.
Nevertheless, the Budget Committee is optimistic that adequate funds
to implement the act will be authorized by the Congress. Funds,
however, will not be available be,fore July 1, 1965.
                        CENTRAL nISBlURSEMENT

   Mr. Olney explained that a system of central disbursement, under
development in the Administrative Office, contemplates the use of
appointment and voucher forms similar to the statistical form AO-191
now in use in most districts. The Administrative Office would be noti­
fied promptly as each appointment is made and vouchers would be sub­              I

mitted directly to the Administrative Office where they would be audit­
ed in advance of payment. All checks would be issued directly from        .
                                                                                  I
                                                                                  I
Washington.
   Some of the auditing procedures contemplated were discussed
briefly by the Committee. It was pointed out that the auditing wonld
consist primarily of an examination to determine whether the voucher
form, on its face, was sufficient to comply with both the statute and
                                                                                  I

the plan approved for the particular district court, and that any COnl­
putabons contained therein were mathematically accurate. .                        ~   ..

   The Committee thereupon formally approved the principle of central             t/
disbursement.
                                                                                  Ij 

                                                                                  i

                          BOARDS OF ADVISERS

    Judge Hastings emphasized the need to obtain the complete coopera­
tion or the bar. This was an important reason for the type of struc­
tural organization recommended bv the Ad Hoc Committee and
approved by the Conference. The Committee considered the recom­
mendation for boards of advisers to the judicial councils and generally
approved of this plan.
    Initially, several members of the Committee expressed some reserva­
tion about the need for a board of advisers on a permanent basis, the
need for a salaried officer in each circuit, and how effective he might
be. It was pointed out that circumstances vary from circuit to circuit.
More than one salaried officer may be required in some circuits and
that there may be circuits in which salaried officers are not required.
Judge Thomsen emphasized the need for an officer, such as the clerk
of court, to assist in the development and maintenance of a plan at
the local district court level. He also suggested that the junior bar
could render effective assistance .
   •J udge ,Johnsen pointed to the need for an overall basic organization
for the administration of the act that would produce some measure of
uniformity. He noted particularly the need for cooperation with
State bar associations, the need for wme type of check on complaints
that may arise in the administration of any district court plan, and the
need to 'handle other matters that arise. ,Tudges McCree and Carter
were impressed both with the need for an overall administrative struc­
ture at the circuit level and for some assistance in handling the pe­
culiarly local problems involved in )mplementing the act.
   .Judge Murrah pointed to the provisions of the Criminal.Justice Act
which seem to require some type of administration at the ci.rcuit leveL
It was his thought that the board of advisers to be appointed in the
10th circuit would meet at the time of the annual judicial conference
of the circuit. He also thought that the salaried officer would be con­
cerned not so much with the pavment of fees to counsel under the act
as he would with such matters "as travel by attorneys, the use of in­
vestigators, and the coordination of these matters among the circuits.
The need is for someone who can be contacted on the circuit leveL
The title "counsel coordinator" was suggested as appropriate for the
salaried officer.
   On motion of Judge Carter, the Committee approved the admin­
istrative structure set out in the Ad Hoc Committee report and author­
ized the appointment of a subcommittee to work out a statement of the
duties and functi()lls oia salaried officer.
                       RULES AND REGULATIONS

   .Judge Hastings requested that the Conlll1ittee consider the scope of
any rules and regulations that might be adopted to govern the opera­
tion of plans formulated under the act, what approach should be taken
in them and any ideas of problems that might be dealt with in rules
and regulations.
(a) lndigency
   Judge BonsaI suggested the need for a test of indigency, which
might be in the nature of an appropriate inquiry. As a matter of
policy it was agreed by the wmmittee that indigency (financial in­
82         JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

 ability to obtain an adequate defense) should be determined by a ju­
 dicial officer and not by the lawyer. It was further. agreed that the
 question of indigency should be open to inquiry at any time.
    Judge Thomsen pointed to the pmblems that are likely to arise
 where a particular defendant orders the court to appoint and pay for
 the servIces of a lawyer of his own choice. It was Judge Carter's
 view that a defendant_generally should not have a right to select any
 particular attorney. Several members of the Committee were of the
 view that the Judicial Conference should not adopt a rule or regula­
 tion that in every instance would prohibit the defendant from select­
 ing an attorney. Judge Johnsen suggested that the regulations should
 list the responsibilities of the district courts under the act, together
 with pitfalls to be avoided.
    Since the district courts generally are looking to the Committee £Or
 ideas and suggestions in the formulation of plans under the act, the
 Committee considered the circulation of some of its ideas and sug­
 gestions to the individual district courts prior to the special session of
the Judicial Conference. Judge Hastings indicated that it might be
 advisable to request the Chief Justice to seek the approval of the
 Advisory Committee of the Conference for the circulation of any
 Committee recommendations prlpr to a meeting of the Conference.
 (b) Appointment of (}o'IJIJUJel
   Judge BonsaI suggested a requirement in the Judicial Conference
regulations for the use in every case of an affidavit by every defendant
setting forth the need for the appointment of counsel. It was sug­
gested that in many cases the defendant could make such a statement
under oath in open (¥}urt but that in a proceeding before a U.S. com­
missioner an affidavit might be needed. It was agreed that it would
be a}lpropriate to include in the regulations some standards for deter­
minmg indigency and requiring that there be in the file or record of
every criminal action a statement or affidavit supporting a determina­
tion of indigency (financial inability) under the statute.
 (c) 	 I nve8tigative 8ervwe8
   Judge Carter suggested that the regulations might make it clear
under the statute that ex parte proceedmgs required £Or an authoriza­
tion of investigative and other services does not :{lrohibit an adversary
proceeding. Judge McCree suggested that the Judge might make an
I.nquiry as to whether the information sought through the investigative
procedure could be stipulated.
   Judge McCree suggested also that if the court finds that a lawyer
has taken all the funds of a defendant for his fee, then investigative
services (in a case where epunsel has not been appointed by the court)
will not be furnished. On the matter of an ex parte hearing to author­
ize investigative services other than counsel services, Judge Hastings
suggested that the regulations should not bind the judge so that he
cannot make any further inquiry.
 (d) Panels of attorneys
   JU<4re BonsaI asked whether a judge must at all times appoint only
from the attorneys whose names are listed on the panel. The Com­
mittee discussed whether approval of the entire court is required to
add the name of an attorney to the approved list. It was suggested
that under the act it may be possible for the court to delegate author­
          JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                   83
ity to the judges sitting in particular divisions to set up panels in
their own areas.
(e) 	Responsibility of the bar
  Judge Thornberry pointed out that many members of the bar think
that since money is available with which to pay counsel, they may now
be relieved entirely from appointments in these cases. Judge Johnsen
suggested that the Conference might say that the responsibility of the
members of the bar to serve in these cases is the same as it was before,
and that the        ge of the Criminal Justice Act in no way lessens
the responsib lty.
  The Committee authorized the appointment of a subcommittee to
consider these suggestions and to develop draft rules and regUlations
under the Criminal Justice Act.
           RULES AND REGULATIONS BY THE CIRCUIT COUNCILS

  The Committee considered the areas in which the judicial councils
of the circuits should concern themselves with the promulgation of
rules and regulations and concluded that the circuit counCils under
the act should make no rules and regulations except as to cases on
appeal. Judge Murrah suggested that the administration of the
act should be primaril,;:- the responsibility of the district courts and
that the judicial counCIls of the circuits should review the plans sub­
mitted by the district courts only to ascertain that they conform to
the rules and regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference
and that they conform to the prOVIsions of the ad.
         DRAFT PLAN FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

   At the request of the Chairman, Judge Carter explained in detail
the provisions of a plan for the representation of criminal defendants
which he had drafted for the Southern District of Califorina. The
draft plan, previously distributed to the members of the Committee,
would place on the bar associations within the Southern District of
California the responsibility for preparing lists of qualified attorneys
and certifying the lists to the court. Judge Carter pointed out, how­
ever, that the members of the bar, though willing to submit lists of
lawyers, appear reluctant to certify as to the ability of any lawyer.
   A suggestion was made that the plan should permit the list sub­
mitted l>Y the bar to be supplemented by the judges.
   The Committee discussed generally the problem of classifyinglaw­
yers for use in particular cases and concluded that this is likely to
be very difficult. An inquiry was made about appointing two lawyers
in a difficult case. Judge Hastings indicated that the statute was
not entirely clear and that perhaps this is an item that might be
covered by a district court plan or by Conference regulation. Judge
Carter indicated that he might appoint experienced counsel in a
difficult case and request a junior to assist him without payment.
   Judge Hastings pointed out that Judge Carter's plan does not en­
compass the use of attorneys from legal aid agencies. The subcom­
mittee should consider this.
   Judge Carter indicated that he would amend his plan to require the
use of an affidavit and that he would require the U.S. commissioner
to fill out the affidavit.
     42-34~6!i--7
 84         JUDICIAL CO.NFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

                     APPOINTMENT BY COJl.LMISSIONERS

   The Committee discussed the provisions of the act requiring that
counsel be furnished to the defendant "from his initial appearance
before the commissioner throu~h . appea1." It was suggested that
this language may not require the presence of counsel at the initial
appearance of the defendant before the commissioner, but only at
subsequent stages. It was concluded, however, that the legislative
history of the act made it clear that counsel must be provided for a
defendant at his initial appearance before a commissioner, if re­
quested.
   Judge Carter suggested that the commissioner in every cnse inform
the defendant that he may hnve a lawyer now, or that he mav 1mve
one later for the trial. In this way a defendant might waive the
appointment of an attorney before the commissioner and request the
appointment of trial counsel.
   Judge Thomsen suggested the need for a prompt notificntion to
the clerk of the court whenever a defendant is confined in jail so that
the trial attorney may be appointed for him, if he so desires. It was
suggested that under the act there may be the appointment of one
attorney to assist the defendant in pro('eedings before the U.S. com­
missioner and the appointment of a different attorney to counsel the
defendant in proceedings before the court.
                                SUMMARY

   .fudge Hastings summarized the discussion thus far by suggesting
 that the plans developed by the district courts might be divided into
these six parts:                                             .
        (1) A method for the preparation of panels of lawyers.
        (2) A method to determine the need to appoint counsel.
        (3) A procedure appointing counsel in proceedings before the
     U.S. commissioner and in proceedings before the court.
        (4) A procedure for authorizing investigative and other
     services.
      . (5) A method for filing claims for reimbursement of expenSeS
     other than the services rendered by counsel.
        (6) A checklist for court appointed counsel (see the checklist
     accompanying Judge Carter's draft plan).
   Judge Hastmgs suggested that each of the six district judges on
the Committee, having these items in mind, prepare a plan for thei.r
own districts so that their views with respect to the problems involved
may be solidified.
                             OTHER MATTERS

 (a) 	 Investigative serVices
   The Committee considered the possibility of establishing a roster
of approved investigators, but concluded that the idea was not prac­
tical in view of the likelihood of requests by detective agencies to have
their agencies added to such a roster.
(b) 	 Other services
   Judge Hastings inquired about a provision in each plan for psy­
chiatric services, pointing out that the statute apparently is intended
to give to a defendant who is financially unable the same services
          JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                    85
that any other defendant might secure. The Committee considered
1he use of a roster of qualified psychiatrists and concluded that the
defendant is entitled to the doctor whom he wants. It was suggested,
however, that where practical available public facilities should be
used.
 (c) 	 Ratification of expenses incurred
   It was (Judge Carter's view that the ratification by the court of
any expenses Incurred, as permitted under the act, should be dis­
couraged and that any plan should state that "ratification is not looked
upon with favor." Judge McCree suggested time limitations on the
filing of a motion for the ratification of such expenses.
(d) Reimbursement for expemes
   It was agreed by the Committee that it should express some policy
with regard to the reimbursement of the expenses of counsel.
 (e) 	 Furnishing counsel onapPf}al
   In considering whether trial counsel should alsO handle the case on
appeal, the members of the Committee noted various problems includ­
ing (1) the need for experience in handling appeals, (2) the problem
of the la\vyer who has concluded an appeal would be frivolous and
does not wish to proceed, and (3) the desIre of the client to have a dif­
ferent lawyer appointed for the appeal. It was agreed that there
should be close lIaison between the trial and appellate courts in the ap­
pointment of counsel on appeal.
                        THE. COMMITrEE REPORT

   Judge Hastings suggested that the report of the Committee be in
final form by December 15 so that it may be distributed to the members
of the Judicial Conference 4 weeks in advance of the special session of
the Conference scheduled for January 13. Each of the six district
judges on the Committee was requested to prepare, as soon as possible,
a model plan for a district court that might be adopted in a district
court simIlar to the one in which he is now sitting.
   Judge Johnsen was app~ip,ted'chairmanof a subcommittee to draft
suggested rules and regulations for the consideration of the Judicial
Conference and to develop a model plan for the appointment of coun­
sel on appeal. Judges Murrah and Hastings were appointed members
of the subcommittee.                                                .
   The appointment of a subc.ommittee to develop a list of duties for a
salaried officer to be appoin'ted by the boards of advisers in each cir­
cuit was deferred until the model plans had been developed and some of
the meetings of the chief ji;Idga~;,of the circuits have been held.
   It was agreed that the Committee would meet in the Administrative
Office conference room on the ground floor of the Supreme Court
Building in Washington, D.C., on November 14,1964.
   A memorandum prepared by Thomas W. Hauser, under the direc­
tion of Judge Carter, with respect to the determination of indigeney
was distributed to the members of the Committee.
   Respectfully submitted.

  Your Ad Hoc Committee on Representation of Indigent Defendants
Accused of Crime in the U.S. Courts has considered preliminarily the
problems arising out of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, Public Law
88-455, approved August 20, 1964, and submits the following report.
The problems involved in the implementation of this legislation are
unique, and the Committee has therefore considered it important to
review, in some detail, the history of the legislation, the problems in­
volved, and the knowledge and experience presently available.
                    I. HISTORY OF THE LEGISLATION

   The Criminal Justice Act of 1963 was originally drafted in the
Department of Justice and arose out of a study by the Attorney Gen­
eral's Committee on Poverty and the AdministratIon of Criminal J us­
tice, under the chairmanshIp of Prof. Francis A. Allen, of the Uni.
versity of Michigan Law School.
                                                                 87
88         JUDICIAL CO]','FERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

    The legislation, as originally conceived, embodied a number of
 features drawn from various sourees,iricluding bills previously rec­
ommended by the ,Judicial Conference of the United States. The
 draft legislation was intended to provide a system of adequate repre­
 sentation in every Federal court, but it left to each court a certain
 amount of freedom and discretion to devise a plan best suited to its
 local needs. The options that would. have been provided under the
 legislation as originally proposed include­
        1. Representation by private attorneys;
        2. Representation by a full-time or part-time Federal public
      defender and assistants;
        3. Representation by attorneys furnished by a bar association,
      or a legal aid society or other local defender or~nization; or
        4. Representation according to !~ plan contaming any com­
      bination of the foregoing.
   The criminal justice bill was introduced in the Senate on March
 11, 1963, and in the House of Representatives on March 13, 1963.
Hearin,&s on the proposed legislation were .held before a subcommittee
of the ben ate Judiciary Committee on May 13,20, and 27, 1963, and
before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee on May 22.
The Attorney General, at the request of the committees and as part
of his testimony, submitted a detailed cost estimate on the bill totaling,
initially, $3,500,000, one-fourth of which covered the estimated cost
of public defender offices in 11 districts. At the time these estimates
were prepared, the Administrative Office was asked informally by the
Department of Justice for suggestions as to a basis for preparing
a cost estimate. The Administrative Office, however, was unable to
supply any information at that time that was not already available to
the Department.
   The proposed Criminal Justice Act:pnssed the Senate on August 6,
1963, substantially in the form in which it was introdueed. In Sep­
tember 1963 the Senate bill -was endorsed by the Judicial Conference.
   On October 24, 1963, the ,Judiciary Committee of the House of
Representatives reported favorably on a bill similar to the proposed
Criminal Justice Act, but eliminated any provision authorizing public
defenders. The House version of the bill was passed on January 15,
1964. Thus there was a basic difference in the two bills on the ques­
tion of public defenders.
   It was not until August 7, 1964, when the conferees of the House
and Senate agreed upon a report, that it was clear there would
be no public defenders in the legislation and that sole reliance would
be placed on a system of compensating counsel on an individual as­
signment, or a case-by-case basis, supplemented by provisions for
al:lthorizing the services of attorneys furnished by a bar association
or a legal aid agency. The Criminal Justice Act was signed by the
President and became law on August 20, 1964.
   The informal request of the Department of Justice to the Adminis­
trative Office in May 1963 produced an awareness of the need to ascer­
tain, on a reliable basis, the amount of time presently being devoted
by attorneys to indigent cases and the amount of money actually
being e       ded out-of-pocket by assigned private counsel. Anticl­

out to develop statistical material that might be of assistance in 

devising a scheme for administering an assign'ed counsel system and 

in estimating the need for appropriations. With the approval of the 

chief judges of the 7th, 8th, and 10th Circuits, the district courts in 

these circuits in July 1963 began the use of a form (AO-191), which 

court-appointed counsel were requested to file following the comple­

tion of their assignments. The information requested on these forms 

included the number of hours devoted by counsel to particular mat­ 

ters-both in and out of court-and a statement of the approximate 

out-of-pocket expenses that were incurred. In addition, the forms 

requested counsel to list any special problems that may have occurred 

in the preparation or trial of the case. The returns on these forms, 

though a sample only, constitute the only information presently avail­

able on the time and the amount of money actually being expended by 

assigned private cOlllsel. 

                  II. APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMITTEE

    In March 1964 the Director of the Administrative Office brought
to the attention of the Judicial Conference various l?roblems that would
 be presented if, as then appeared imminent, the legIslation to authorize
 paymen~ of compensation to counsel appointed to represent indigent
 persons accused of crime in the U.S. courts should be enacted.
    The Conference at that time discussed various aspects of the prob­
 lem of administering a system of compensating assigned counsel and,
 in J?articular, the recommendations of a special committee of the As­
 SOCIation of the Bar of the City of New York and the National Legal
 Aid & Defender Association. These recommendations, with respect
 to an assigned counsel system, are:
         1. Using rotation to assign qualified counsel;
         2. Centralizing assignment in a single administrative unit;
         3. Having indigency determined by someone other than the 

      assigned counsel i 

         4. Providing for the reimbursement of assigned counsel for 

      all ex~enses incurred; and 

         5. Compensating counsel adequately.
    The Conference suggested that the quoted recommendations be
brought to the attention of all circuit conferences, and recommended
the appointment of a committee in each judicial circuit to consider the
various problems of compensating appointed counsel. The Confer­
ence also authorized the appointment of an ad hoc committee to work
with the Administrative Office in developing rules, procedures, and
guidelines for an assigned counsel system .
. Immediately thereafter the Chief Justice appointed a committee
consisti'nS of Chief ,Judge John S. Hastings of the7th Circuit, chair­
man; C1llef Judge Harvey M. Johnsen of the 8th Circuit; and Chief
Judge Alfred P. Murrah of the 10th Circuit. Upon its appointment,
!l'nd pr.ior to the sch~dulins: of a?y meeti?g, the Committee l;egan
unmedlately to compIle avaIlable mformatIon on the use of asSIgned
counsel in the Federal courts and to solicit ideas and suggestions from
those who were experienced in this field. Realizingtheimportancc of
obtaining full information as to the services of assigned counsel, the
Conimittee . arranged to institute the use of forms AO-191 '·and a
                                                                            ;)
90         JUDICIAL CONFEtRENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

,second form for use in courts of appeals (AO-192) on a nationwide
 basis. A letter was addressed to the chief judge of each circuit asking
'him to urge the district courts to begin the use of these forms and to
 commence the use of the forms in the courts of appeals. During the
 latter part of July and the early part of August 1964, the forms were
 widely distributed and made available to the individual courts. Inas­
 much as the forms are not to be completed until after a criminal case
 is completely closed, there has been no substantial return to date from
 this expanded program.
    In a further attempt to secure information concerning existing
 practices and procedures in selecting attorneys for assignment in
 criminal cases, the Committee addressed a letter to the chief judge
 of each circuit and to each district judge representative on the Judicial
 Conference of the United States requesting a general statement on the
procedures followed in their courts in assigning counsel for the in­
 digent' with em1?hasis on such matters as how indigency is determined
 at the present time; whether panels of lawyers have been established,
with or without the cooperation of the bar; whether there is any
system for rotating assignments; and whether any effort is made to
avoid such things as assigning inex'perienced oounsel toa difficult trial
.or assigning a busy, highly expenenced lawyer to a routine matter.
The Committee also requested any observations or suggestions as to
hlodifications or new procedures that maybe thought to be necessary
if legislation is passed authorizing fees and reimbursement of expenses
 to assigned counsel from public funds.
    The reeponseto these letters was very generous but the answers
:received failed to uncover any system now m use that would serve as
a model for (1) developing and maintaining systematically a roster
.of lawyers for appointment by the court, (2) assurin/5 impartial
representation by counsel adequately experienced in handlmg the type
of case to which he has boon assigned, and (3) coordinating appomt­
ments with State and local courts which must look to ,the same
members of the bar to accept assignments in their courts. The replies
did show a general lack of appreciation as to the seriousness and
complexity of the problems which might be raised by the new legisla­
tion. The reeponses further indicated an initial impression by many
1udges that a system of payment to assigned counsel could be super­
lIDpOSed on whatever system of assignment may be presently in use.
                        m.   PROBLEMS PRESENTED

   In the deliberations of the Committee there were many problems
raised which apparently were not fully anticipated or realized at the
time the legislation was considered. It is apparent that if the legisla­
tion is administered in the manner intended, it will bring about a
significant advancement in the administration of Federal criminal
justice. It is equally apparent that if the legislation is poorly
administered, it could bring adverse criticism upon the courts.
   First of all, it must be recognized that there will be more criminal
cases in the future requiring the assi    ent of counsel for the indigent
than there have been in the past.        tistical informati.on, compiled
in the Administrative Office and used by various witnesses at the hear­
ings on the Criminal Justice Act, indicated that during the fiscal year
           JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                         91
ending June 30, 1962, the most recent year for which figures were
then available, counsel were assigned to 9,669 criminal defendants
whose cases were terminated during the year, or approximately 31
percent. These figures and percentages are not considered by the
Committee to be a reliable estimate for the future. First of all, they
do not take into consideration the entirely new provision in the act
requiring the assignment of counsel at the level of the U.S. commis­
sioner. Nor do they take into account the likelihood that in the future
and in order to protect the record, courts and commissioners will be
less inclined to accept waivers of cOlmsel by defendants who appear
before them.
   The most recent statistical compilation covering the 10-month period
from July 1963 to April 1964, regarding the assignment of counsel
to criminal defendants acquitted or sentenced during this period, is
as follows:
Total defendants acquitted or sentenced... _____________________________ 28, 771

    Defendants for whom counsel were assigned by the courL___________ 9,583
    Defendants for whom counsel were not assigned:
        TotaL _____________________________________________________  18,784

            Defendants with privately retained counseL______________ 9, 53Q
            Defendants who waived the 8Ippoin'tment of counseL_______ 5,944
            Defendants for whom counsel were not assigned but informa­
             tion on the waiver of counselor the appearance of privately
             retained counsel is not available________________________ 3,31()
    Defendants on whom information as to the assignment of counsel is
     not available__________________________________________________        41()
   In attempting to estimaJie the future from the foregoing statistics4
the Committee reasons that the total defendants acquitted or sentenced
will remain approximately the same as will the number of defendants
with privately retained counsel. The Committee believes the other
items in the foregoing table will be vastly different with a very great
increase in the number of defendants for whom counsel must be as­
signed by the court and an equally great decrease in the number of
defendants waiving the appointment of counsel and the number for
whom information is not available as to whether they did or did not
have counsel. The increase in the number of assignments of counsel
resulting from the wholly new requirement of requiring the appoint­
ment of counsel on appearance before the U.S. commissioner the Com­
mittee considers to be completely unpredictable. The decrease in the
number of waivers of the appointment of counsel is also hard to pre­
dict, although the Committee is convinced the decrease will be very
substantial.                                                          .
   In the absence of actual experience, the Committee believes that it
is reasonalble to estimate the number of defendants for whom counsel
must be assigned by the court during the forthcoming year by taking
the total defendants, subtracting the number of pnvately retained
counsel, and assuming that counsel will have to be assigned by the
court or the U.S. commissioner for the balance. The Committee thinks
it probable that such a calculation will make ad~uate allowance for
the appointments by U.S. commissioners and the decrease in t.he waiv­
ers of counsel.
 92        JUDICB.L . CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

     In any cas'e, it seems certain that the Criminal Justice Act will re­
  quire in the future a very large increase in the number of counsel
  assigned to indigent persons iLccused of crime in the Federal courts.
     Secondly, recognitIon must be given to the needs of the State courts.
  Recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, pa,rticu­
 larly the decision in Gideon v. lVain'toright, 372 U.S. 335, make it
 clear that in the future members of the bar 'will be called upon more
  frequently to contribute their talent to the defense of the indigent in
 criminal cases in all courts of the Nation. The totality of this addi­
 tional burden placed upon the bar in anyone arE''[\' undoubtedly re­
 quires coordination of assigi.unents. The seriofIsness of this problem
 is evident in the District of C{)lumbia where, despite the existence of
 a local Legal Aid Agency, which was established by a 1960 act of
 Congress and charged with the responsibility of making available
 attorneys for assignment in certain courts in the District, there exists
 several different rosters of attorneys and several different methods
 for the selection and appointment of counsel. The present system, in
 which each court in effect administers its own aSSigi.lment system, re­
 suIts in an inordinate number of successive or multiple appointment.c
 of many of the same attorneys. Chief Judge DaVId L. Bazelon (If
 the District of Columbia Circuit has written a letter to the Direct(.r
 of the Administrative Office, copies of which were also sent to the mem­
 bers of your Committee, which vividly describes the present confusion
 and need for coordination of assignments in the District of Columbia.
 In other areas, where both State and Federal courts must draw upon
 the same bar, the need for coordination of assignments is no less bll't.
 the problems of cooperation between the court systems are evell
 greater.
    Further complexity arises not only from the necessity of avoidincr
duplication and conflicts in assignments, but from the need to evolve
a plan that will provide counsel that is competent and independent
in his approach to his particular assignment. Experienced counsel
will be needed for difficult cases and less experienced counsel for less
difficult cases, but how this differentiation between lawyers can be
made administratively presents a difficult problem.
    The Cri.minal Justice Act in authorizing the reimbursement of bar
associations and legal aid agencies for legal or investillative service
supplied by them presents additional problems of making arrange­
ments with these associations and agencies that will insure adequate
service to the indigent defendant with payment therefor within the
framework of the act.
    Services other than counsel are also authorized. The act provides
in part "counsel for a defendant who is financially unable to obtain
investigative, expert, or other services necessary to an adequate defense
in his case may request them in a~ ex parte application." These serv­
ices may be authorized by the court after appropriate inquiry and
finding that they are necessary. The act, however, provide~ no criteria
and no standard, other than that of necessity for the serVlces, and no
guidelines for determining "reasonable compensation" for services.
There is, however, a limitation of $300 on the amount that may be paid
to anyone person or to any organization for services rendered by an
employee. To guarantee against possible abuses in the use of in­
vestigative and expert services, other than counsel services, a system
           JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                     93

  for evaluating the need for these services, determining that they have
 been performed competently, Itrtd insuring the reasonah1enoos of pay­
 ments requested, seems desirable and necessary.
    Finally there is the problem of devising a system for disbursing
 funds appropriated to administer the act. The status of the appropri­
 ation must be known at all times lest obligations be incurred that
 exceed the abi lity of appropriated funds to sustain them; vouchers and
 payments made thereunder should be correct in the first instance, for
 adju.stments either for <?verpayments or un~erI?aymen~s ll:re likely to,
 be dIfficult; and comparlsonsGfcost ,from dIstrIct to. .dIstrlCt, and case
 to case should be readily obtainable.                .
    The efficient control of appropriations suggests to the Committee
 in the first instance the need for a scheme for the central disbursement
 of appropriated funds. Preliminarily, the Administrative Office has
 recommended a system of central disbursement which involves (1) a
 prompt notification to the Administrative Office of every appointment
 as it is made, and (2) the submission of vouchers containing informa­
 tion as to the nature and extent of services rendered both In and out
 of court and expenses incurred. The submission of vouchers directly to
 the Administrative Office would permit determining, ih advance of the
 issuance of each covering check, whether the claim covered by the
 voucher meets the requirements of the statute, the rules and regula­
 tions of the .Judicial Conference and the judicial council, and is con­
 sistent with the plan adopted for the district.
    In the formulation of a plan within each district for furnishing
representation for defendants who are financially unable to obtain an
 adequate defense, the Committee is convinced that an approach must
be devised that will recognize all the problems described above, as
well as others, and provide a solution to them. In addition, all plans
should conform to the standards approved by the Judicial Conference
at its March 1964 session, as set out above.      .   .
    Under the statute the responsibility for formulating a plan rests
in the first instance on the district court. However, the t~me schedule
in the act, requiring the adoption of a plan in each district within
6 months of the date of. enactment (August 2.0,1964), with,'approval
by the judicial councils within 9 months and to be effective within
1 year, will require that the plans submitted to the judicial councils,
or at least most of them, be acceptable in form a.nd content in the
first instance.
                   IV. PRELI1I:[lNARY CONSIDERATIONS

   The problems resulting from the new legislation were considered at
a Committee meeting in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, Septem­
ber 12, which was also attended by Judge William F. Smith, Chairman
of· the Judicial Conference 'Connhittee ontheAdm-inj$r~tiQn. of .the
Criminal Law, Warren Olney, Director of the Administrative Office,
and members of his staff.
  In discussing how acceptable plans could be developed for all 90
Federal districts within the timetable set under the statute, the Com­
mittee considered at length the provisions of the District of Columbia
Legal Aid Act apJ?roved January 27, 1960 (74 Stat. 229). The
scheme of organizatIon and adminIstration authorized by this statute
has, of course, received congressional approval. The District of
94        JUDICIAl, CO:"fFE,RENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

 Columbia Legal Aid Act provides for a panel of judges consisting of
 the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DIstrict of Colum­
 bia CircUIt; the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District
 of Columbia; the chief judge of the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals; the chief judge of the District, of Columbia Court of General
 Sessions; the President of the Board of Commissioners of the District
 of Columbia; and the chief judge of the Juvenile Court of the District
of Columbia.
   The function of the panel of judges is t,o appoint a Board of Trustees
 for the Legal Aid Agency from members of the bar, being seven in
 number, and serving staggered terms of 3 years. The Board of
Trustees is authorized by the statute to appoint a salaried Director
 of the Legal Aid Agency who is responsible to the Board and is.
subject to removal by them. The primary responsibility of the Agency
 under the statute is "making attorneys available to represent in­
digents" in criminal proceedings in the courts in the District of Colum­
bia. Thus the District of Columbia Legal Aid Agency is administered
by an independent board of lawyers selected for the purpose by III
panel made up of the chief judges of the courts established in the
District. Within the limits of the funds and personnel available to
it, the A~ency has proven to be practical and successful.
   The Committee considers that the District of Columbia Legal Aid
Act establishes, or at least suggests, principles and a pattern for
 administrative o~ganization whIch, as mentioned above, has received
the approval of Congress and believes that it is feasible to adapt the
same principles and approximately the same administrative pattern
under the Criminal Justice Act of all Federal courts.
   The Committee believes that this might be done by establishing it,
board of advisers to the judicial council of each circuit, the members
of which would serve without pay and would be appointed by a panel
of judges consisting of the chief judge of the circuit and the chief
judges of each of the district courts within the circuit. The total
number of members on each board of advisers should be left to the
judicial council of each circuit, but should not be less than one member
from each State within the circuit and should not exceed a total of nine
members on any board. Because the bar is organized on the basis of
States rather than Federal districts, it should be required that every
board of advisers must include at least one practieing attorney from
each State within the circuit, each of whom would be selected by a vote
of the entire panel of judges. :Members should serve for specified
staggered t e r m s . .                                             .
   Further paralleling the District of Columbia Legal Aid Act, the
board of advisers to the judicial council in each circuit should be au­
thorized to appoint a compensated, full-time officer to be called by some
distinguishing title.
   This officer should enjoy considerable stature and prestige. This is
necessitated by the importance 'and delicacy of his functions, Such an
officer is needed to stimulate and assist the districtJ'udges and the bar
in every district in the circuit in formulating an developing pJans
under the Criminal Justice Act suitable to local conditions and which
are in conformity with standards to be :approved by the judicial coun­
cils and the Judicial Conference of the United States, This is a task
that obviously requires great tact, skill, and ingenuity. This work will
          JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES                    95
involve many personal contacts to obtain the views of the judges in
each district, to arouse the interest, cooperation, and assistance of the
local bar, to keep all informed concerning similar plans of 'adminis­
tration that are being developed in other districts and circuits, and to
give advice as to whether plans under consideration conform with rules
and regulations that may be recommended.by the judicial councils of
the circuits and the Judicial Conference of the United States. He
will need to consult with and assist the judges and the bar in develop­
ing satisfactory and acceptable procedures for compiling and keeping
current rosters of attorneys eligible for appointment to the defense of
criminal cases, not only in the various places of holding court but also
in the additional places where U.S. commissioners are located. He
will be needed in every district to work out with the bar and with ap­
propriate State officials some way of coordinating Federal and State
assignments so as to avoid repeated or conflicting assignments between
Federal and State courts that may place an undue and unfair burden
upon some members of the bar. He will be needed to keep in touch
with the clerk in every district in order to assist and advise in working
out the processing of requests for the appointment of experts and in­
vestigators and the procedures for the approval of claims for compen­
sation for legal and other services. He will be needed to help develop
and,apply administrative procedures at every stage which will provide
maximum relief for the judges from administrative detail. He will
be needed to receive from each district in the circuit for transmission
to the board of advisers to the judicial council all suggestions and
com~laints from district judges, members of the bar, and others con­
cernmg the operation of the system and in connection therewith he
will be needed to make such inquiries as the board may direct. He
will be needed toad as an agent for the Administrative Office in the
field to work out the numerous difficulties that are bound to arise con­
cerni~ appointments and the processing- of claims for compensation.
   InitIally, the board of advisers to the Judicial council should review
all the "'plans submitted by the district courts of the circuit for im­
plementmg the Criminal Justice Act and should make recommenda­
tions to the judicial council for approval, disapproval, or modification.
When the plans are in operatIOn, the board should consider and
evaluate all suggestions and complaints about the plans, or their daily
operation, made by the bar, the judges, the litigants and others, making
recommendations to the judicial council where appropriate. The
board should also exercise general supervision and direction over its
salaried officer in the performance of his duties.
   On the second day of its meeting, Sunday, September 13, the
Committe met with the representatives of the Department of Justice,
the ~al, Aid Agency of the District of ColumbIa, and the National
Legal Aid & Defender Association, as follows:

   At the Sunday meeting the problems previously mentioned were
 again discussed at length and the views of all those present, were re­
quested as to the practicality and desirability of the administr:;ttiye
 scheme, outlined above. It was the vie,v'of all those presentfhat t.he
 administration of the Criminal Justice Act, through a board of ad­
 visers to the judicial council in each circuit, constituted as above de­
scribed, assisted by a full-time officer, was both practical and desirable,
and the most feasible of any alternative for administration that has
been suggested. The representatives of the NLADA pledged their
support of the proposal.
   The Committee then met privately and considered at length the
matter of costs and budget for carrying out the Criminal JustlCe Act.
All available statistical information was reviewed upon which esti­
mates might be based of the number of assignments of counsel that
might be necessary next year, the average compensation. thatw<;lUld:
probably be allowed, the probable costs of experts and investigai9rs,
and the general costs of administration through boards of advisers to
the judicial councils of the circuits with a salaried officer for each and
with a system for the central disbursement of funds by the Adminis­
trative Office of the U.S. Courts. The Committee resolved to submit
its tentative conclusions on these matters to the Judicial Conference
Committee on the Budget when it meets in 'Washington on Tuesday,
