                   JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief Judge

mittee of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Repre­
sentatives on the appropriation requests for the fiscal year 1966
had been held, but that no report by the Appropriations Commit­
tee had as yet been issued. Chief Judge Matthew F. McGuire,
who at the request of the Chairman of the Committee appeared
at the hearings in support of the appropriation requests, informed
the Conference that Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen had made
                                  3

an excellent presentation in justification of the need for funds
totaling $7,500,000 to implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964.
The Committee is hopeful that adequate funds to administer the
Act will be appropriated.
                    JUDICIAL STATISTICS
  Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman of the Committee
on Judicial Statistics, presented the report of the Committee.
         ADDITIONAL CIRCUIT AND DISTRICT JUDGESHIPS

  Judge Johnsen reported that the Committee had undertaken,
with the assistance of the Division of Procedural Studies and
Statistics of the Administrative Office, a systematic and compre­
hensive statistical review of the judicial business of the circuit and
district courts for the purpose of evaluating the need for additional
judgeships. The study was made in the light of the policy adopted
by the Conference at its September 1964 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 52) of making a comprehensive report to the Congress approxi­
mately every 4 years on the need for additional judgeships. In
accordance with the resolution of the Conference and on the basis
of its study of current needs, the Committee submitted its recom­
mendations for additional circuit and district judgeships and
recommended that they be approved by the Conference and that
the Congress be requested to take action on them at its present
session.
   Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr. informed the Conference that the
Committee on Court Administration concurred in the recommen­
dations of the Statistics Committee, but further recommended the
creation of three additional district judgeships not recommended
by the Statistics Committee, one of which arises in connection with
the proposal to create two additional districts in the State of
California.
   The Conference received the reports of the Committees on Judi­
cial Statistics and Court Administration and reports from the chief
judges and the district judge representatives of the respective
circuits concerning the state of the dockets in each circuit and
district. On the basis of the Committee reports and the discussions
in the Conference, the Conference voted to reaffirm its recommen­
dation for the creation of four additional temporary circuit judge­
ships in the fifth circuit, previously recommended by the Conference
                                        4

(Conf. Rept., Sept. 1964, p. 63), and the creation of the following
judgeships not heretofore recommended by the Conference:
Oourts of Appeals:
    1 additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
    1 additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
    1 additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
Didrict OQurts:

        1 additional judgeship for the District of Rhode Island 

    Second Judicial Circuit: 

        1 additional judgeship fOr the Western District of New York 

        1 additional judgeship for the District of Vermont 

   Third Judicial Circuit;
       3 additional judgeships for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the first
         three vacancies occurring thereafter not to be filled
   Fourth JUdicial Circuit: 

      1 additional judgeship for the District of Maryland 

      2 additional judgeships for the Eastern District of Virginia 

   Fifth Judicial Circuit:
       1 additional judgeship for the Middle and Southern Districts of Alabama
       1 additional judgeship for the Northern District of Florida
       1 additional judgeship for the Middle District of Florida
       2 additional judgeships for the Southern District of Florida
       1 additional judgeShip for the Southern District of Georgia
       4 additional judgeships for the Eastern District of Louisiana
       1 additional judgeship for the Northern District of Mississippi
       2 additional judgeships for the Southern District of Texas
       1 additional judgeship for the Western District of Texas
   Sixth Judicial Circuit: 

       1 additional judgeship for the Northern District of Ohio 

       1 additional judgeship for the Southern District of Ohio 

   Seventh Judicial Circuit :
       1 additional judgeship for the Northern District of Illinois
      1 additional judgeship for the Southern District of Indiana
      1 additional judgeship for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, the first va­
         cancy occurring thereafter not to be filled.
   Ninth Judicial Circuit:
       1 additional judgeship for the District of Alaska, the first vacancy occur­
          ring thereafter not to be filled
       1 additional judgeship for the District of Arizona
   Tenth Judicial Circuit:
      1 additional judgeship for the District of Kansas, the first vacancy occur­
         ring thereafter not to be filled
                                  5

  The Conference also recommended that the existing roving
judgeship in the State of Florida be made a judgeship for the
Middle District of Florida only.
                      ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS

   li.R. 4534, 89th Congress, would create two additional judicial
districts in the State of California; establish three additional divi­
sions with three new places of holding court at Oakland, Redding,
and San Jose; and create eight additional district judgeships for
the State. Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the
Committee on Court Administration had considered li.R. 4534
and recommended that it be approved with certain modifications.
The Committee recommended (1) that Oakland, Redding, and
San Jose be designated as places of holding court, but that the
provisions in the bill setting up separate statutory divisions in
the Northern and Eastern Districts of California be eliminated;
and (2) that the number of additional judgeships to be created
for the State be reduced from eight to four, two of which would
be assigned to the new Northern District of California and two
to the new Central District of California. It was also suggested
that the provisions in the bill requiring judges to reside at certain
places of holding court in the Northern District of California be
eliminated as unnecessary. The Judicial Council of the Circuit
has authority under the law, 28 U.S.C. 134(c), to fix the residence
of a district judge when the public interest and the nature of the
business of the court so require. The Conference thereupon ap­
proved the bill with the modifications suggested and voted to rec­
ommend to the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit that upon
the enactment of this legislation action be taken to designate one
or more judges to reside and have their official stations at Oakland
and at San Jose in the Northern District of California.
   The Conference also voted to recommend that in the event the
additional districts as provided for in li.R. 4534 are not authorized
that t·here be created one additional judgeship for the Northern
District of California and two additional judgeships for the South­
ern District of California.
  The Conference further directed that its recommendations with
respect to additional judgeships and the creation of two additional
districts in the State of California be incorporated in a single bill
and transmitted to the Congress.
                                  6

                      RESIDENCE OF JUDGES

  The Conference recommended to the Judicial Council of the
Fourth Circuit that one of the two additional judges recommended
for the Eastern District of Virginia be designated under the statute,
28 U.S.C. 134(c), to reside and have his official station at Norfolk:.
  The Conference also recommended to the Judicial Council of
the Fifth Circuit that the roving judge recommended for the
Middle and Southern Districts of Alabama be designated to reside
and have his official station at Mobile in the Southern District of
Alabama and that one of the two additional judges recommended
for the Southern District of Texas be designated to reside and have
his official station at Corpus Christi.

                         JUDGESHIP BILLS

   Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the Chairmmen
of the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Repre­
sentatives had requested the views of the Conference on numerous
bills introduced in the 89th Congress to provide additional judge­
ships for individual district courts. Upon recommendation of the·
Committee on Court Administration and in accordance with the
above recommendations pertaining to additional judgeships, the
Conference took the following action:
   (1) Disapproved H.R. 3387, 89th Congress, to provide an ad­
ditional district judgeship for the District of Minnesota;
   (2) Approved S. 13, H.R. 752 and H.R. 2019 to provide addi­
tional judgeships for the Northern and Southern Districts of Ohio,
but recommended that the proposals contained in these bills be
incorporated in the overall judgeship bill;
   (3) Disapproved H.R. 5188 to provide an additional temporary
judgeship in the Northern District of Ohio and one in the Southern
District. It was the view of the Conference, as stated above,
that these additional judgeships should be provided on a perma­
nent basis; and
   (4) Disapproved S. 620, H.R. 3222, and H.R. 3226 to provide an
additional judgeship for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on a
permanent basis. I t was the view of the Conference that an ad­
ditional judgeship for the Eastern District of Wisconsin should be
provided on a temporary basis.
                                   7

                         COURT OF CLAIMS

   The Committees on Judicial Statistics and Court Administration
recommended the creation of two additional judges for the Court
of Claims. In addition, the Committee on Court Administration
recommended appropriate legislation to enable the Court of Claims,
in the consideration of cases before it, to sit in panels of three. The
Conference thereupon voted to recommend the creation of two
additional judges for the Court of Claims and an amendment to
the statute that would permit the Court to sit in panels of three.
                  COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration,
Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the report of the Committee.

   S. 578, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 47(a) to provide
means for the disqualification of circuit judges for bias or prejudice,
is identical with S. 2538, 88th Congress, which was referred to the
Committees on Court Administration and Revision of the Laws at
the September 1964 session of the Conference (Con!. Rept., p. 62).
The bill would provide that an affidavit stating the reasons for the
belief that bias or prejudice exists shall be filed not less than 30
days before the hearing of the proceeding, or good cause shall be
shown for failure to file it within such time. It was the view of
the Committees that it would be extremely difficult to operate
courts of appeals with the efficiency with which their workloads
require if the provisions of this bill should become law.
   The Committees were further of the view that no need for the
bill appears or has been shown. Upon recommendation of the
Committees, the Conference voted to disapprove the bill.
                     RESIGNATION OF JUDGES

  S. 631, 89th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 371 (a) to permit
United States judges who have atta.ined the age of 65 and have
served 15 years to resign and continue to receive the salary they
were receiving at the time of their resignation. It was the view
of the Committees on Court Administration and Revision of the
Laws that the bill, if enacted into law, would tend to destroy the
                                  8

present retirement system and might militate against the continu...
ance in useful service of senior judges retiring under the present
provisions of law at age 65 after 15 years of service. Upon recom­
mendation of the Committees, the Conference voted to disapprove
the bill.
              RETIREMENT OF TERRITORIAL JUDGES

   S. 723, 89th Congress, would provide for the inclusion of years
of service as judge of the Circuit Court for the Territory of Hawaii
in the computation of Federal judicial service of the Honorable
Martin Pence. In the opinion of the Committees on Court Ad­
ministration and Revision of the Laws, Judge Pence's service as
a judge of the Circuit Court of the former Territory of Hawaii was
substantially the equivalent of service in a State court and that
this service, therefore, should not be included in computing his
service as a United States district judge. Upon recommendation
of the Committees, the Conference voted to disapprove the bill.
  S. 163, 89th Congress, would provide that the amendment to
28 U.S.C. 373, made by Section 5 of the Act of February 10, 1954,
68 Stat. 13, should apply to any judge of the United States District
Court for the District of Hawaii who retired under Section 373
before February 10, 1954, as if such amendment had been in effect
on the date of retirement of the judge. The proposals contained
in this bill were previously disapproved by the Conference (Conf.
Rept., March 1963, p. 9). Upon recommendation of the Com­
mittees, the Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of the bill.

                   SUPREME COURT VACANCIES

  H.R. 536, 89th Congress, would require that all decisions of the
Supreme Court shall be participated in by the full Court, and that
any vacancies or absences in the membership of the Court shall be
temporarily filled by circuit judges. The bill would specifically
authorize the Chief Justice, with the approval of the other members
of the Court, to designate circuit judges to serve temporarily on
the Supreme Court. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference voted to disapprove the bill.
  The Conference also voted to disapprove H.R. 887, 89th Con­
gress, which is similar to H.R. 536 except that it would permit
judges of the Court of Claims, as well as circuit judges, to be desig­
nated for service on the Supreme Court.
                                 9

           QUALIFICATIONS FOR JUSTICES AND JUDGES

   H.R. 713, 89th Congress, would. amend the Judicial Code to
provide that no person may be appointed to the Supreme Court
unless at the time of his appointment he has had at least 5 years
of judicial service and would provide further that persons who
have held certain Federal and State offices shall be ineligible for
appointment to any Federal judgeship within 5 years after leaving
such offices. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference voted to disapprove the bill.

                   PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

  The Conference was informed that the Judicial Council of the
Fifth Circuit had disapproved plans to provide new Federal court
facilities at Fernandina Beach in the Middle District of Florida.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the proposal was also
disapproved by the Conference.

  CONSOLIDATION OF JUDICIAL DISTRICTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA

   The Conference at its March 1963 session (Conf. Rept., p. 5)
approved a bill to consolidate the Eastern and Western Districts
of South Carolina into one judicial district. The Conference was
informed that a new draft of such a bill had been prepared which
is identical to that previously considered by the Conference except
that it does not eliminate any existing places of holding court.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference reaf­
firmed its approval of the proposed consolidation of the Eastern
and Western Districts of South Carolina and approved the new
draft bill submitted by the Committee.
CoMMISSION ON EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, AND JUDICIAL SALARIES

   The Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House
of Representatives requested the views of the Conference on H.R.
3321, 89th Congress. The bill would establish a Commission on
Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries to consist of nine
members to be appointed respectively by the President of the
United States, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the
House, and the Chief Justice of the United States. The Com­
rirission would review, at stated intervals, the rates of compensa­
                                10 


tion and certain expense allowances of Members of Congress and
other officers in the Legislative Branch of the Government.; Jus­
tices, Judges, and certain other personnel of the Judicial Branch;
and officers whose salaries are fixed under the Executive Pay Act
of 1964. The Commission would determine the appropriate com­
pensation levels and relationships of the respective officers and
would report to the President with respect thereto. The bill would
further require that the President include in the next budget trans­
mitted by him to Congress his recommendations with respect to the
exact rates of compensation, amounts and kinds of expenses and
allowances, including any specific requirements, conditions, and
all other matters related thereto which he deems advisable. The
Conference discussed the role of the Chief Justice in selecting per­
sons to serve as members of such a Commission and concluded
that it would be more appropriate for this function to be performed
by the Conference itself. Accordingly, the Conference voted to
recommend an amendment to the bill to place the responsibility
for the selection of Commission members on the Judicial Confer­
ence of the United States rather than on the Chief Justice. The
bill, as amended, was approved by the Conference.

RETIREMENT PROVISIONS FOR DIRECTORS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
             OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS

  The Conference at its September 1964 session (Conf. Rept., p.
63) authorized the preparation of a draft bill to provide adequate
retirement provisions for Directors of the Administrative Office of
the United States Courts. The Committee was informed, how­
ever, that the President had requested the Civil Service Commission
to investiga,te the retirement benefits for all executive personnel.
Representatives of the judiciary are planning to participate in
informal discussions for the purpose of having the Director and
Deputy Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts included in any plan that may be formulated. The Com­
mittee accordingly requested and was granted leave to report to
the Conference at a later session.

                    SUPREME CoURT SALARIES

  S. 610, 89th Congress, would increase the rates of compensation
of the Chief Justice of the United States and of the Associate Jus­
                                 11 

tices of the Supreme Court in order to restore the relationship be­
tween the salaries of Justices of the Supreme Court and the salaries
of other Federal judges and Members of Congress that existed
prior to the Government Employees Salary Reform Act of 1964,
Public Law 88-426. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference approved the bill.

     PHOTOGRAPHS OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE UNITED STATES
                          CoMMISSIONERS

   Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the recent tele­
vising and taking of photographs at a hearing before a United
States commissioner in Meridian, Miss., in breach of the policies
of the Judicial Conference and of the local rules of the district
court, appear to have been inadvertent. The Conference noted
that the Attorney General on March 11, 1965, issued a memoran­
dum to all United States Attorneys and their assistants calling
attention to the resolution adopted by the Judicial Conference in
March 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 8) and instructing them to inform
the United States commissioners of the resolution of the Confer­
ence when, in their judgment, the possibility exists that photo­
graphs will be taken during any hearing before a commissioner.
The Conference reconsidered and reaffirmed previous Conference
action taken at the March 8-9, 1962, meeting, at which time the
Judicial Conference resolved to condemn the taking of photographs
in the courtroom or its environs in connection with any judicial
proceeding and the broadcasting of judicial proceedings by radio,
television, or other means. The Conference reaffirmed the applica­
tion of Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which
substantially embodies prior Conference action, to all proceedings
in United States courts, including ceremonial proceedings, and to
all proceedings before United States commissioners wherever held.
The Conference, in noting the recent Meridian incident, agreed
that the taking of photographs or the broadcasting of proceedings
before a United States commissioner should not be permitted
regardless of whether such hearing or proceeding takes place on
Federal property, in the private office of the commissioner, or
otherwise. The Conference instructed the Director of the Admin­
istrative Office of the United States Courts to bring this Conference
action to the attention of all United States judges and all United
States commissioners.

                  REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on
Revision of the Laws, submitted the report of the Committee.
                 COURT OF CLAIMS JURISDICTION

   H.R. 1665, 89th Congress, would amend the Judicial Code to
confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims to hear, determine,
and render judgment in cases referred to it by resolution of either
House of Congress. The Court of Claims now has jurisdiction
over two distinct classes of cases, (1) those arising under general
or special jurisdictional statutes in which the court awards a final
judgment, and (2) those submitted to the court by resolution of
either House of Congress upon which the court submits to the
Congress an advisory report setting forth the court's findings and
recommendation. In the case of Glidden v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530
(1962), the Supreme Court questioned the validity of the con­
gressional reference jurisdiction of the Court of ClaiIllB in view of
the statute declaring it to be a constitutional court. The proposed
legislation would give to the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear
and render judgment upon equitable claims referred to it by either
House of Congress, in lieu of rendering an advisory opinion to the
Congress. Judge Maris reported that the Committees on Court Ad­
ministration and Revision of the Laws had considered jointly the
proposal contained in H.R. 1665 and were unanimously of the view
that the bill is appropriate as a constitutional substitute for the
congressional reference jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. Upon
recommendation of the Committees, the Conference approved the
bill.
                   MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION

   The Subcommittee of the Conference Committee on Pretrial
Procedure, which was appointed to study pretrial procedure in
multiple litigation with common witnesses and exhibits. submitted
to the Committees on Court Administration and Revision of the
Laws admft of a proposed new § 1407 of Title 28. United States
Code. to provide for the temporary transfer to a single district for
coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings of civil actions
pending in different districts which involve one or more common
questions of fact... The transfer would be made by a judicial panel
consisting of seven circuit and district judges, each from a different
circuit, to be designated by the Chief Justice. The panel would
                                 13 

have general supervision over such consolidated pretrial proceed­
ings and would be empowered to request the temporary assignment
under existing law of circuit or district judges to conduct the
proceedings. At or before the completion of the pretrial proceed­
ings, the panel would remand each case to the district of origin
unless it had previously been terminated during the course of the
pretrial proceedings.
   The Committee reported that the proposal has grown out of the
practical experience of the Committee on Multiple Litigation in
conducting pretrial proceedings in the electrical equipment private
antitrust litigation. The 'proposed legislation would establish a
procedure to meet the problems involved in conducting efficiently
and economically the pretrial deposition and discovery proceedings
in litigation of this type and would be invoked only if the judicial
panel determined its use would promote the just and efficient con­
duct of the litigation. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference approved the draft bill submitted by the
subcommittee.
                      DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

   The Bureau of the Budget had requested the views of the Con­
ference on a proposed bill to transfer certain functions from the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia to the
District of Columbia Court of General Sessions and to certain other
agencies of the Municipal Government of the District of Columbia.
The proposals contained in the draft bill would carry out recom­
mendations contained in a report submitted to the Committee on
Appropriations of the House of Representatives by a Committee
representing the Bureau of the Budget, the District of Columbia
Government, and the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts. It was the view of the Committees on Court Administra­
tion and Revision of the Laws that the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia should be relieved of the local func­
tions with which the bill deals. Upon recommendation of the
Committees, the Conference approved the draft bill and directed
that the Bureau of the Budget be so informed.
                      RULES OF PROCEDURE

   The Conference in March 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 22) approved a
bill to amend 28 U.S.C. 2072 to enlarge the present civil rulemaking
authority of the Supreme Court of the United States to include
                                14 

appellate rules, bankruptcy rules, rules for the review and enforce­
ment of orders of the administrative agencies, and the consolidation
of the present admiralty rulemaking power with that for all other
civil actions. Legislation was subsequently enacted conferring
upon the Supreme Court full power to prescribe rules of procedure
under the Bankruptcy Act, Public Law 88-623. It further devel­
oped that certain technical amendments should be made in the
Hobbs Act, 5 U.S.C. 1041, and in 28 U.S.C. 2112, in connection
with the grant of rulemaking authority for the review or enforce­
ment of agency orders. The Committee, therefore, prepared a re­
draft of the proposal embodied in the previous bill, H.R. 11101,
88th Congress. The new draft bill was approved by the
Conference.
                          INTERPRETERS

   H.R. 4515, 89th Congress, would provide for the designation of
qualified interpreters to assist defendants who are unable because
of deafness to understand proceedings in criminal cases. The Com­
mittee had previously called attention to the proposed amendments
to Rule 28, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and to Rule 43,
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which would authorize the court
to "appoint an interpreter of its own selection and determine the
reasonable compensation of such interpreter and direct its payment
out of such funds as may be provided by law." (Conf. Rept.,
March 1964, p.16.) Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference directed that the Committee on the Judiciary of the
House of Representatives be informed that in view of the antici­
pated amendment of Rule 28, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
and of Rule 43, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the enactment of
H.R. 4515 is not believed to be necessary.
                           LEGISLATION

   The Conference, on recommendation of the Committee, gave its
specific approval, to the extent indicated, to the following bills
pending in the 89th Congress, which would carry out proposals
approved, in whole or in part, by the Conference at previous
sessions:
   (1) S. 35 and H.R. 5283, 89th Congress, to provide for the in­
clusion of years of service as judge of the District Court for the
Territory of Alaska in the computation of years of Federal judicial
service for judges of the United States District Court for the
District of Alaska. (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1964, p. 61.)
                                 15 

    (2) S. 122 and H.R. 4890, 89th Congress, to provide cost-of­
living allowances to judicial employees stationed outside the con­
tinental United States or in Alaska or Hawaii. The Committee
recommended that S. 122 be amended to make it identical with
H.R. 4890 and with H.R. 11651, 88th Congress, as previously ap­
proved by the Conference. (Conf. Rept., September 1964, p. 66.)
    (3) H.R. 854, 89th Congress, to extend the provisions of 28
U.S.C. 1963 for the registration of judgments to the district courts
of the Virgin Islands, Guam and the Canal Zone and to provide for
the registration of that portion of divorce decrees providing for
the payment of money or the transfer of property. (Conf. Rept.,
Ma,rch 1963, p.16.)
    (4) H.R. 856, 89th Congress, to provide for the publication
before entry of decrees, judgments, and orders entered by consent
upon the merits of civil antitrust proceedings in the district courts
and in proceedings before a board or commission for the enforce­
ment of any provision of the Clayton Act or the Federal Trade
Commission Act. (Conf. Rept., March 1963, p. 16.)
    (5) H.R. 1763, 89th Congress, to provide for the payment of
witness fees in habeas corpus cases and in proceedings under 28
U.S.C. 2255 for persons authorized to proceed in forma pauperis.
(Conf. Rept., September 1963, p. 68.)
    (6) H.R. 1781, 89th Congress, to provide for the holding of
court at Clinton in the Eastern District of North Carolina. (Conf.
Rept., September 1964, p. 57.)
    (7) H.R. 2653, 89th Congress, to provide for the holding of
court at New London, Conn. (Conf. Rept., September 1963, p.
66.)
    (8) H.R. 3989, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 1446(b) to
extend from 20 days to 30 days the period of time fixed for the
filing of a petition for the removal of a case from a State court to
a Federal court. (Conf. Rept., September 1963, p. 72.)
    (9) H.R. 3990, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 1871 to in­
crease the per diem and subsistence and limit mileage allowances
of grand and petit jurors. (Conf. Rept., March 1963, p. 50.)
    (10) H.R. 3991, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 373 to re­
duce from 10 to 8 years the length of judicial service required of a
territorial judge in order to entitle him to receive a retirement
pension at or after age 65. (Conf. Rept., September 1963, p. 72.)
    (11) H.R. 3992, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C.753(f) to
                                 16 

provide for the furnishing of transcripts in proceedings under 28
U.S.C. 2255 to persons permitted to proceed in forma pauperis.
(Conf. Rept., March 1963, p.11.)
   (12) H.R. 3997 to amend 28 U.S.C. 753(b) to provide for the
recording of proceedings in the United States District Courts by
means of electronic sound recording, as well as by shorthand or
mechanical means. (Conf. Rept., September 1963, p. 60.)
   (13) H.R. 3999, 89th Congress, to provide life tenure for judges
of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.
 (Conf. Rept., March 1963, p.16.)
   (14) H.R. 4386, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 2401 to toU
the running of the statute of limitations on tort claims against the
United States by persons under legal disability or beyond the seas
at the time their claims accrue. (Conf. Rept., September 1963,
p.77.)
   (15) H.R. 3998, 89th Congress, to increase the fees of jury
commissioners in the United States district court from $5 to $10
per day. The Committee pointed out that the proposal to in­
crease the fees of a jury commissioner to $10 a day, first approved
by the Conference in September 1958 (Conf. Rept., p. 35), is now
very inadequate. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference recommended that the bill be amended to increase the
compensation of a jury commissioner to $25 per day.
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, re­
affirmed its disapproval of the proposals contained in the following
bills pending in the 89th Congress:
   (1) S. 102, 89th Congress, to provide for the holding of court
at Williston, N. Dak. (Conf. Rept., September 1964, p. 57.)
   (2) S. 204, 89th Congress, to confer jurisdiction on the district
courts to hear and render judgment on certain claims of any officer
who is a member of a Reserve component of the uniform services
of the United States. (Conf. Rept., September 1964, p. 66.) The
Conference also disapproved H.R. 5268, 89th Congress, which
would waive the statute of limitations on these claims.
   (3) S. 536, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 2112(a) with
respect to the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals to review orders
of administrative officers and agencieS, and to amend the National
Labor Relations Act to provide for the trial of unfair labor practice
cases in the United States district courts... (Conf. Rept., Septem­
ber 1958, p. 8; September 1961, p. 80; and March 1964, p. 20.)
                                 17 

   (4) H.J. Res. 34, 89th Congress, proposing a constitutional
amendment to provide that "no person who has attained the age
of seventy years may serve as a judge of any court of the United
States, but any person who ceases to serve as a judge of such court
because he has attained the age of seventy years shall continue to
receive the compensation to which he was entitled as a judge."
 (Conf. Rept., September 1964, p. 62.)
   (5) H.R. 289, 89th Congress, to amend the so-called Wunder­
lich Act to provide for the full adjudication of the rights of Govern­
ment contractors in courts of law. (Conf. Rept., September 1964,
p.66.)
   (6) H.R. 855 and H.R. 919, 89th Congress, to authorize members
of the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States to practice
before the courts of appeals and the district courts. (Conf. Rept.,
March 1961, p. 22; March 1963, p.18.)
   (7) H.R. 2807, 89th Congress, to provide for the enforcement
of support orders in certain State and Federal courts and to make it
a crime to move or travel in interstate or foreign commerce to avoid
compliance with such orders. The Conference had previously ex­
pressed disapproval of those provisions of the proposed legislation
which would provide for the registration and enforcement of
support orders by Federal district courts. (Conf. Rept., September
1963, p. 73.)
   (8) H.R. 2057, 89th Congress, to require each district judge
except in the District of Columbia to be a resident of the district
(or one of the districts) to which he is appointed at least 3 years
immediately prior to the time of his appointment and thereafter
while in active service. (Conf. Rept., September 1964, p. 61.)
   (9) H.R. 5078, 89th Congress, to amend the Judicial Survivors
Annuity Act, 28 U.S.C. 376, to authorize payment of an annuity
to a widow who has remarried, if her remarriage has been termi­
nated by divorce upon her own application and without fault on
her part. (Conf. Rept., September 1964, p. 60.)
                  CoURT OF VETERANS ApPEALS

  The Conference considered various bills introduced in the 89th
Congress to authorize some type of judicial review of the denial
of a veteran's claim. After full discussion the Conference voted to
express the view that the review of this type of claim should not
be cognizable in our constitutional judicial system. The Con­
                                18 

ference thereupon took the following action with respect to bills
pending in the 89th Congress:
   (1) Approved the type of judicial review provided for in S. 1200,
H.R. 211, H.R. 676, H.R. 2242, and H.R. 5859. These bills would
establish a separate court of veterans appeals with commissioners
who would conduct hearings at the local level. (Conf. Rept.,
September 1964, p. 67.)
   (2) Disapproved H.R. 2220 and H.R. 4156 which would establish
a Court of Veterans Appeals, but require the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Office of the United States Courts to assume respon­
sibility for its administrative affairs. (Conf. Rept., March 1963,
p.18.)
   (3) Disapproved H.R. 840 which would confer jurisdiction on
the Court of Claims to review de novo claims for benefits and
payments under laws administered by the Veterans Administra­
tion.. (Conf. Rept., March 1963, p.19.)
   (4) Disapproved H.R. 952, H.R. 1589, and H.R. 3953 which
would confer jurisdiction upon the district courts to review
decisioIlB upon veterans' claims. (Conf. Rept., March 1963, p. 19.)
        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
   Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing Com­
mittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, reported that comments
concerning the preliminary drafts of proposed amendments to the
Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure, including the pro­
posed unification of the civil and admiralty practice, and the pre­
liminary draft of a complete set of Uniform Rules of Federal
Appellate Procedure are being received by the Committee. The
Advisory Committees have scheduled meetings to be held this
spring to consider the comments received and to formulate final
recommendations to be submitted to the standing Committee. A
full meeting of the standing Committee is scheduled to be held late
in June and the Committee expects to formulate at that meeting
its recommendations on definite proposals to submit to the Con­
ference at its session next September.
   Judge Maris also reported that the legislation authorizing the
promulgation of rules of practice and procedure under the Bank­
ruptcy Act had been enacted into law during the second session of
the 88th Congress. As a result the Advisory Committee on Bank­
ruptcy Rules has commenced work on developing a new and
comprehensive set of rules for bankruptcy cases.
                                  19 

   Judge Maris also called attention to the recent announcement
by the Chief Justice concerning the appointment of an Advisory
Committee to Develop Uniform Rules of Evidence for the district
courts. The Reporter for the new Evidence Committee, Professor
Edward W. Cleary of the University of Illinois, is now formulating
a suggested outline of the work of the Committee. When the out­
line is completed, it is expected that the Chairman, Albert E.
Jenner, Jr., of Chicago, will convene a meeting of the new
Committee.
        INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
    The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Intercircuit
 Assignments, Circuit Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported on the
 processing of requests for intercircuit assignments from August 11,
 1964, to February 6, 1965. During this period the Committee
 recommended favorably on a total of 33 assignments, of which 31
 have been, or will be, undertaken by 26 judges, 5 of whom have
 each accepted 2 assignments. One senior circuit judge was unable
 because of illness to undertake his assignment. All assignments
 recommended by the Committee were approved by the Chief
 Justice except one where the papers were so delayed in reaching
 the Committee and the Administrative Office that the Chief Justice
 could not make the designation in time. The 31 assignments were
 undertaken by 6 circuit judges, 3 senior circuit judges, 10 district
 judges, 5 senior district judges, 1 judge of the Court of Customs
 and Patent Appeals, and 1 senior judge of the Court of Claims.
    The Conference was informed that the need for intercircuit as­
 signments to the courts of appeals continues to grow. The Com­
 mittee believes that the situation is caused, at least in part, by the
increase in appeals resulting from the additional district judge­
 ships created in 1961. It was reported that conditions in the Fifth
 Circuit continue to cause grave concern. Even if the two existing
 vacancies on the court of appeals are filled promptly, the need for
 assistance will remain until some other action is taken to alleviate
 the situation. The Committee doubts that the number of circuit
 judges available for assignment will be adequate to serve the needs
 of the Fifth Circuit for any protracted period. The Committee
 also called attention to the situation of the Court of Appeals .for
 the First Circuit, where one vacancy exists and one of the two
 remaining circuit judges is able to perform only limited service
 because of physical disability. The availability of district judges
     1170-950-65----4
                                 20 

in the circuit for assignment to the court is limited because of local
conditions.
   The Conference was also informed that the corps of senior judges
available for assignment was reduced considerably during the past
year by death and disability. The Committee, however, continues
to encourage service by the senior judges and extends its full coop­
eration to them. Every effort is being made to use such assistance
as the senior judges may give. The report of the Committee,
including a statement relating to the need for intercircuit assign­
ments and the availability of judges for such service, was received
and approved by the Conference.
       ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW

  The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law, Circuit Judge William F. Smith, presented the re­
port of the Committee.
               MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

   H.ll. 677 and H.ll. 2092, 89th Congress, would strengthen the
criminal penalties for the mailing, importing, or transporting of
obscene matter, and for other purposes. These bills would require
the imposition of mandatory minimum fines and terms of im­
prisonment for either the first or subsequent violations. Similar
legislation was disapproved by the Conference in September 1961
(Conf. Rept., p. 98.) Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of the proposals con­
tained in this legislation.
     APPEALS BY THE UNITED STATES IN CRIMINAL CASES

   The Bureau of the Budget had requested the views of the Confer­
ence on a draft bill, sponsored by the Attorney General, to amend
18 U.S.C. 3731 to authorize an appeal by the Government "from
a decision made before trial sustaining a motion for the return
of seized property or to suppress evidence, provided the United
States Attorney shall certify, to the court granting such motion,
that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay." Similar legis­
lation was previously considered by the Conference and disapproved
(Conf. Rept., September 1957, p. 28; March 1960, p. 24.) Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference reaffi.rmed its
disapproval of this legislation.
                                      21 


   TIME SPENT BY DEFENDANTS IN CONFINEMENT PRIOR TO 

                      SENTENCING 

   S. 647 and H.R. 3577, 89th Congress, would amend 18 U.S.C.
3568 to assure that all persons convicted of offenses against the
United States will receive credit toward seryice of their sentences
for time spent in custody in connection with the offense for which
sentence was imposed. The right to credit under existing law
extends only to those cases in which the defendant has been sen­
tenced to a mandatory term of imprisonment. Similar legislation
was considered and approved by the Conference in September 1964
(Conf. Rept., p. 90). Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference approved the bill.

       PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION IN CRIMINAL CASES
  S. 290, 89th Congress, would add a new section to the Criminal
Code, Title 18, United States Code, to provide as follows:
      It shall constitute a contempt of court for any employee of the United
   States, or far any defendant or his attorney or the agent of either, to furnish
   or make available for publication information not already properly filed
   with the court which might affect the outcome of any pending criminal
   litigation, except evidence that has already been admitted at the trial.
   Such contempt shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.
  The bill embodies the modification of an earlier proposal recom­
mended by the Committee and approved by the Conference in
September 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 84.) Upon recommendation of
the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its approval of the pro­
posalcontained in the bill.

                  JURY TRIAL OF CONTEMPT CASES
   The Conference in September 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 88) referred
to the Committee for further study the proposal contained in S.
535, 89th Congress, which would provide "That in any prosecution
for criminal contempt in the courts of the United States, the ac­
cused shall upon request be accorded a trial by jury." It was the
view of the Committee that this bill would seriously circumscribe
the traditional authority of the courts as defined by 18 U.S.C. 401
to proceed summarily, without the intervention of a jury, to punish
for such contempt as the following:
   (1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto
as to obstruct the administration of justice;
                                 22 

   (2) Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transac­
tions; and
   (3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order,
rule, decree, or command.
   The Committee was further of the view that the right of an ac­
cused to trial by jury in an appropriate case is adequately protected
by Sections 402 and 3691 of Title 18, United States Code. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved
the bilL
                         RIGHT OF TRIAL

   S. 291, 89th Congress, is a bill to effectuate the provisions of
the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requiring
that a defendant in a criminal case be afforded the right to a speedy
trial. The bill would (1) require the dismissal of a criminal case
where there had been an unreasonable delay in presenting charges
to a grand jury or in filing an information, (2) bar a subsequent
prosecution for an offense charged in an indictment or information
that was voluntarily dismissed by the Attorney General, (3) re­
quire that a person against whom there is pending more than one
indictment or information be brought to trial in the order in which
the indictments or informations were returned or filed, (4) require
that a defendant be brought to trial no later than 9 months after
the indictment is returned or the information filed, except that a
court may, in its discretion, extend the time in which the case shall
be delayed on good cause shown, and (5) require the imposition
of sentence no later than 60 days after judgment of conviction is
entered.
   The Committee pointed out that these amendments would im­
pliedly amend various statutes of limitation, prohibit reindictment,
interfere in the orderly administration of criminal calendars in
those districts having a heavy caseload, and interfere with the
discretionary authority of the court to invoke remedial sentencing
procedures. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference disapproved the bill.
                    DEFINITION OF A FELONY

   The Committee reported favorably on the proposal of the Judi­
cial Conference of the Ninth Circuit that the definition of a felony
contained in paragraph one of 18 U.S.C. 1 be amended to read as
follows:
                                    23 

     Any otlense punishable by death <Jr imprisonment for a term exceeding
   1 year is a felony: Provided, that when a person is convicted of any felony
   and the sentence imposed by the court does not provide for imprisonment
   for a term exceeding 1 year, such person shall, for all purposes, after the
   judgment of conviction shall have become final and after the sentence im­
   posed upon him shall have expired, be deemed to have been charged with
   and convicted of a misdemeanor, and such person shall not sutler any disa­
   bility or disqualification which would otherwise result from a conviction
   of a felony.
   The Conference discussed the proposed new definition of a felony
and directed that it be referred to the Committee for further study
in the light of the discussions in the Conference.
  PRESENCE OF THE DEFENDANT AT THE TIME OF SENTENCE

   S. 1956 and H.R. 7912, 88th Congress, would have amended
18 U.S.C. 4208 (b) and (c) to provide that when a defendant is
committed to the custody of the Attorney General for observation
and study the defendant need not be present in court when the
report is received and action is taken as to any affirmation or modi­
fication of the original sentence. The Conference discussed· the
proposals contained in this legislation, but deferred action thereon
pending further study by the Committee.

            WITNESS' FEES IN HABEAS CoRPUS CASES

   H.R. 1763, 89th Congress, would authorize the payment of wit­
ness' fees in habeas corpus cases and in proceedings to vacate sen­
tence brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255 for persons who are authorized
to proceed in forma pauperis. Similar legislation had been previ­
ously recommended by the Conference (Conf. Rept., September
1961, p. 69). Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference reaffirmed its approval of the proposals contained in the
bill.
      HABEAS CORPUS APPLICATIONS BY STATE PRISONERS

   Judge Smith informed the Conference that the Committee, at
its last meeting, had given consideration to the Conference spon­
sored bill relating to applications for writs of habeas corpus by
prisoners in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court
because of the impact it may have upon the administration of the
criminal law in the Federal courts. It was the view of the Com­
mittee that the impaneling of a court of three judges, as would be
provided for in this bill, may lead to serious problems of adminis­
tration. The Committee was also of the view that the review of
                                        24 


a final order of a three-judge district court only by the Supreme
Court on writ of certiorari would place an unusually heavy burden
on the Court. The Committee, accordingly, recommended that
the proposed legislation be again referred by the Conference to
the Habeas Corpus Committee for further study and consideration.
   Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
Habeas Corpus, informed the Conference that the Committee had
met briefly to consider the recommendation of the Criminal Law
Committee and that it had no objections to undertaking further
study and consideration of the proposed legislation. Judge Phillips
pointed out, however, that this action represents no expression,
at this time, by the Committee on the merits of the legislation.
The Conference thereupon referred the proposed legislation to the
Habeas Corpus Committee for further study and consideration in
accordance with the suggestion of the Committee on the Adminis­
tration of the Criminal Law.
                BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   Judge Edward Weinfeld, on behalf of Senior Judge Oliver D.
Hamlin, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy Adminis­
tration, reported that the Committee had met and considered the
recommendations contained in the survey report of the Director
of the Administrative Office, dated January 22, 1965, relating to
the continuance of referee positions to become vacant by expiration
of term and for changes in arrangements for referees. The Com­
mittee also considered the recommendations of the district judges
and of the judicial councils of the circuits concerned.
   The Conference considered fully the Committee's report and the
recommendations of the Director, the judicial councils and the
district judges. On the baais of the report and recommendations,
the Conference took the following action relating to changes in
arrangements for existing referee positions and the filling of the
referee positions to become vacant by expiration of term, and
directed .that, unless otherwise noted, the changes become effe~tive

                          ApPROPRIATIONS

   The Conference was advised that appropriation estimates for the
operation of the Bankruptcy system during the fiscal year 1966 in
the amount of $11,249,000 have been submitted to the Congress.
The appropriation estimates, if approved by the Congress, will
provide the funds needed for the 12 new referee positions and for
changing 7 positions from a part-time to a full-time basis, as author­
ized by the Conference last year. The estimates also include funds
for additional clerical personnel and other services for referees'
offices.
   The Committee reported that receipts into the Referees' Salary
and Expense Fund during the fiscal year 1966 are expected to equal,
or exceed, the estimated obligations for the year. The Referees'
Salary and Expense Fund was reported to have at the present time
a credit balance of approximately $11 million.

ApPOINTMENT OF A PART-TIME REFEREE AS TRUSTEE IN A CHAPI'ER
                          X   PROCEEDING

   The Committee had previously recommended, and the Con­
ference approved, a proposed amendment to Section 39b of the
Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 67 (b), to prohibit the service by a part­
time referee as trustee in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Act. (Conf. Rept., September 1964, p. 82). The National Bank­
ruptcy Conference had suggested that the service of a part-time
referee as a receiver under the Bankruptcy Act should also be pro­
hibited. Upon recommendati<;m of the Committee, the Conference
approved the suggestion of the National Bankruptcy Conference
and reaffirmed its approval of the proposal with the suggested
amendment.
                 AMENDMENT OF CHAPTER         XIII
 . S. 613 and H.R. 292,89th Congress, entirely different bills, con­
tain provisions which would change the wage earner proceeding
under Chapter XIII from an entirely voluntary proceeding to a
compulsory proceeding under certain circumstances. While it is
recognized that many straight bankruptcy cases can and should be
administered as wage earner proceedings, it was the view of the
Committee that the proposals contained in these bills are discrim­
inatory in singling out a low-income group that would be compelled
under Chapter XIII to pay their debts in full. Other petitioners,
                                 29 

not wage earners, could still avail themselves of straight bank­
ruptcy proceedings and the benefits arising out of a discharge of
debts. Moreover, it seemed unfair to the Committee to compel a
debtor to accept a plan under Chapter XIII without equal com­
pUlsion upon secured creditors to accept the same plan. Upon rec­
ommendation of the Committee, the Conference voted to disap­
prove S. 613 and H.R. 292.
                            LEGISLATION

  The Committee requested and was granted leave, to consider
the following bills, sponsored by the National Bankruptcy Con­
ference, which have been recently introduced in the 89th Congress:
   (1) H. R. 20 to amend sections 140(5), 656(a)(3), and 661 of
the Bankruptcy Act with reference to confirmation of plans under
Chapter XIII and the dischargeability of debts;
   (2) H.R. 291 to amend section 64a, 238, 378, and 483 of the
Bankruptcy Act with reference to the priority of debts and to repeal
sections 354 and 459 of the Bankruptcy Act; and
   (3) H.R. 293 to amend Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act to
clarify certain administrative procedures.
                 AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   The Conference was informed that the Bankruptcy Division of
the Administrative Office is continuing its examination of statistical
reports of closed bankruptcy cases for the determination of errors
in the computation of amounts due to the Referees' Salary and Ex­
pense Fund and overpayments of compensation to receivers and
trustees. The Committee, however, has received no recent report
of any situation requiring Committee action with respect to the
accountability of a referee for administrative errors in computing
the compensation of receivers and trustees or in computing
amounts due to the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund.
   The Administrative Office is also continuing to accumulate in­
formation from the statistical reports that may disclose a monopoly
of appointments in any district. The Committee anticipates that
a longer period of study will be required in order to provide more
definitive information on this subject.
                  MATTERS UNDER ADVISEMENT

  The Conference was informed of a general improvement in re­
gard to the number of matters held under advisement for more
                                 30 

than 60 days by referees in bankruptcy. Those few instances
where it appeared that matters had been held under advisement
for longer periods of time than were necessary have been brought
to the attention of the judges of the district courts concerned.
The Committee has been assured that a special effort will be made
to have these matters decided expeditiously.
         DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CRAPTER XIII

   The Committee reported that the guidelines for Chapter XIII
administration, promulgated by the Conference at its September
1963 session (Conf. Rept., p. 87), are being complied with by the
courts and that during the current fiscal year the compensation
of trustees in Chapter XIII proceedings will be held within the
maximum limit on the salary of a full-time referee in bankruptcy.
In several large metropolitan areas, however, the courts have not
reduced the number of persons appointed as trustees in Chapter
XIII cases to one trustee for the area, as recommended by the
Conference. The Committee has requested the Bankruptcy Divi­
sion of the Administrative Office to report further at the next
Committee meeting .
                . DEBTOR'S CoUNSELING SERVICE
   Judge Weinfeld informed the Conference that the «debtor's
counseling service" procedure instituted in the Western District
of Wisconsin is still under consideration by the Judicial Council of
the Seventh Circuit and that the council has decided to permit the
referee to continue a modified plan of debtor counseling for another
6 months. The Committee has requested the Administrative Office
to review the plan and to report thereon at the next Committee
meeting.
                      SEMINAR FOR REFEREES
  Judge Weinfeld announced that the second Seminar for Referees
in Bankruptcy will be held in Washington, D.C., during the week
of March 29. The 41 referees invited to attend include tho..c:e ap­
pointed during the past year and all referees appointed since 1959
who have not previously attended a seminar. The program is
again being sponsored by a committee of referees under the chair­
manship of Referee Asa S. Herzog of the Southern District of New
                                 31 

York. The committee will be assisted by 12 experienced referees
in bankruptcy who will serve as discussion leaders.

                       FEES AND CHARGES

  It had been brought to the attention of the Committee that the
rules for the detenmnation of "net proceeds realized" and of pay­
ments under Section 40c(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
68(c)(2), have been subject to varying interpretations resulting
in a lack of uniformity in the application of the schedule of fees
and charges for the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund. The
Committee has requested the Administrative Office to study these
matters and report to the Committe at its next meeting.

                       HABEAS CORPUS

   Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
Habeas Corpus, called attention to the amendment to 28 U.S.C.
2241, recommended by the Committee and approved by the Con­
ference in September 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 107), which would
permit an application for a writ of habeas corpus made by a person
in custody under the judgment and sentence of a State court of
a State which contains two or more Federal judicial districts to
be filed either in the district wherein such person is in custody or
in the district court for the district within which the State court
was held which convicted and sentenced him.
   When the Committee report was originally presented, Chief
Judge Woodbury suggested that the proposal be broadened to em­
brace the case of a person, convicted and sentenced in a State court,
who was in custody in a Federal institution located in another
State under a contract between the State of his conviction and
the Federal Government. Judge Phillips reported that the Com­
mittee, after study, had concluded that it was not possible to draft
a statute that would satisfactorily overcome the practical problems
involved, particularly the transportation of prisoners over long
distances. The Committee recommended, therefore, that the pro­
posal made by Judge Woodbury be disapproved. This recom­
mendation was approved by the Conference.
                                 32
   ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  Judge Luther W. Youngdahl, Chairman of the Committee on
the Administration of the Probation System, presented the report
of the Committee to the Conference.
                      PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES

   The Committee recommended an amendment to the Probation
Act, 18 U.S.C. 3651 et seq., to authorize the payment of the cost
of psychiatric examinations and services rendered probationers
pursuant to court order from funds appropriated to the judiciary.
While it is clear that a psychiatric examination may now be made
at the expense of the government in the case of a probationer who
is believed to be presently insane or who is involved in a proceed­
ing to revoke probation, it is not certain whether such an exam­
ination may be authorized at Government expense for any other
purpose. It was the view of the Committee that psychiatric as­
sistance is also needed in some cases in determining the course of
probation. Chief Judge Bazelon further suggested that the pro­
posal be broadened to permit probation officers to utilize the serv­
ices of psychiatrists, psychologists, or other experts in the medical
and social sciences when the aid of such persons is deemed neces­
sary. The Conference thereupon approved the recommendation
of the Committee with the modification suggested by Judge
Bazelon.
             RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER

   Judge Youngdahl reported that consideration of the proposal to
establish a research and development center in the correctional
field had been delayed due to changes of personnel in the positions
of Attorney General, Director of the Bureau of Prisons, and Di­
rector of the National Institute of Mental Health. Discussions
and negotiations, however, will soon be resumed and a further
report will be made to the Conference at a later session.
                     SENTENCING INSTITUTES

  Judge Youngdahl informed the Conference that the regional
Institute on Sentencing held at Lompoc, Calif., October 19-22,
1964, as authorized by the Qonference (Conf. Rept., September,
1964, p. 92), was highly successful. Included in the program wa.q
                                 33 

a tour of the Federal Correctional Institution at Lompoc and a
demonstration of an actual parole hearing by a member of the
parole board. As a result of experience at this institute, the Com­
mittee is planning to revise the format of future institutes to allow
a greater amount of time for judges to participate in discussion,
to include visits by participants to institutions maintained by the
Federal Bureau of Prisons and to afford opportunity for participat­
ing judges to witness actual hearings before officers of the Board
of Parole. Judge Youngdahl also informed the Conference that
the sentencing institute for the judges of the third circuit held at
Lewisburg, Pa., November 11-13, 1964, was well received by the
participating judges and very successful.
  The Conference was informed that the Committee is tentatively
planning another Sentencing Institute to be held at McNeil Island,
Wash., either late in September or early in October 1965. At the
request of Judge Youngdahl, the Conference authorized the Com­
mittee to convene a meeting of the chairmen of the circuit com­
mittees on sentencing institutes to discuss plans and programs for
sentencing institutes to be conducted at the circuit level.
                      PRESENTENCE REPORTS

  Judge Youngdahl informed the Conference that the Subcom­
mittee on Presentence Reports and Supervision had prepared a
monograph entitled "The Presentence Investigation Report." On
authorization of the Committee, the monograph will be distrib­
uted to judges of the district courts and to all probation officers.
The monograph includes a uniform presentence report outline and
format designed to serve jointly the needs of the courts, the Bureau
of Prisons, and the Board of Parole.
  PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO RULE            32(c),   FEDERAL RULES OF
                      CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

   The Committee reported that its survey of the district judges
to determine their opinion of the proposal of the Advisory Com­
mittee to amend Rule 32(c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
had been completed. Of the 270 district judges replying, only
18 favored the proposed amendment. The Committee plans to
reproduce the results of the entire survey and distribute it to each
member of the Advisory Committee and to the Attorney General
for their information.
                                 34
        REGIONAL SUPERVISION OF PROBATION OFFICERS

  Judge Youngdahl informed the Conference that the Committee
had considered the proposed regional organization of the probation
system as a possible method of increasing efficiency and effective
ness and that a pilot program designed to test the feasibility of
such a system has been approved by the Committee. It was
pointed out, however, that the Committee's approval of the pilot
program does not constitute a criticism of or a finding adverse to
the present system whereby district judges have primary responsi­
bility for their probation officers.

       GROUP COUNSELING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

   The Committee reported that funds are now available from the
Vocational Rehabilitation Administration, Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare for a limited pilot study, and the prepara­
tion of plans for a complete study, of the group counseling pro­
gram in the probation office of the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia (Conf. Rept., September 1964, p. 94).
The pilot study will be undertaken by a private research organiza­
tion.
   Recently the chief probation officer for the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has requested assist­
ance in setting up a group counseling program in the Philadelphia
office similar to the program in the District of Columbia.
                      DEFERRED PROSECUTION

  The Conference discussed the problems involved in placing per­
sons under the supervision of probation officers when there has been
no criminal conviction. On motion of Judge Arraj, the Conference
requested the Committee to undertake a study of the problems
discussed in the Conference and to report thereon at a later session.

                   VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION

   The Conference was informed of the joint effort of the Federal
Probation System and the Vocational Rehabilitation Administra­
tion, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to make avail­
able to selected probationers and parolees resources of voca­
tional training, medical attention, provision of necessary tools, and
funds for board, room, and clothing. An application from the State
                                35 

of Washington for a planning grant has recently been approved by
the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration.
                       BAlL INVESTIGATIONS

   Judge Youngdahl called attention to the recent proposal that
Federal probation officers be used to conduct investigations to com­
pile information for use by United States commissioners in fixing
bail. Judge Youngdahl informed the Conference that the Com­
mittee considers such investigations to be inconsistent with the
work of the probation officers and that the Committee would oppose
any such suggestion.
                 SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
  The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Personnel, Chief
Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report of the Committee to
the Conference.
                        CruER-LAW CLERK

   Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman of the Eastern District of
Virginia had suggested to the Committee that 28 U.S.a. 755 be
amended to authorize the combined position of crier-law clerk for
district judges. The Committee was of the view that there are
instances when such a combination position of crier-law clerk
might be helpful to a partiCUlar judge, but pointed out that the
suggestion must be considered in the light of the Appropriations
Act which sets a limitation on the aggregate salaries of law clerks
and secretaries. Upon recommendation of the Committee the
Conference approved a draft of an amendment to 28 U.S.C. 755,
submitted by the Committee, subject to any changes. in the
language of the draft bill that may appear necessary or desirable.
                   COURT REPORTER-SECRETARY

  The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, sep­
arated the position of court reporter-secretary authorized for Chief
Judge Fred M. Taylor of the District of Idaho and authorized the
appointment of both a court reporter and a secretary by Judge
Taylor.
                           SECRETARIES

  The Judicial Council of the District of Columbia Circuit had
recommended that each circuit and district judge be permitted to
                                 36 

appoint a secretary in any grade up to and including JSP-ll or
JSP-12, as the appointing judge may determine, and that the
aggregate salaries that may be paid to the secretary and the law
clerk of anyone judge be increased accordingly. The Committee
reported that it had requested the Administrative Office to make
a survey of employee positions which may be comparable to that
of secretary to a Federal judge. A complete review of this matter
will be undertaken at the next meeting of the Committee.
                         COURT OF CLAIMS

   The Court of Claims had requested an additional secretarial­
stenographic position at grade JSP-7 to provide additional assist­
ance to the secretary of the court. It is also contemplated that the
person to be employed will also provide part-time secretarial serv­
ice to the auditors. The Conference was inf{)rmed by the Commit­
tee that authorization of this particular position would not require
an increase in appropriations. The Conference thereupon approved
the request of the Court of Claims.
                      CHIEF DEPUTY CLERKS

   Chief Judge Gus J. Solomon of the District of Oregon had sug­
gested to the Committee an increase in the salaries of chief deputy
clerks in large district courts such as the Southern District of Cali­
fornia. The Committee recommended, however, that the sugges­
tion be disapproved in view of the fair consideration given these
positions in fixing salaries under the Judiciary Salary Plan. This
recommendation was approved by the Conference.
                   RETIREMENT OF SECRETARIES

   The Conference in September 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 73) approved
a proposal to provide for secretaries to Federal judges the same
retirement benefits as are now provided for members of congres­
sional staffs. At the suggestion of the Committee, the Conference
recommended that a bill to so provide be introduced in the 89th
Congress.
      CoST-oF-LIVING ALLOWANCES OUTSIDE CoNTINENTAL
                          UNITED STATES

   S. 122 and H.R. 4890, 89th Congress, would provide cost-of­
living allowances for judicial employees stationed outside the con­
                                37 

tinental United States or in Alaska or Hawaii. Judge Levin
informed the Conference that these bills embody the proposals
previously recommended by the Conference (Conf. Rept., March
1964, p. 37.)
                        COURT REPORTERS

  The Committee reported that the Administrative Office had
recommended that senior judges who continue to render substantial
service to the district courts be provided with the services of a
regular court reporter in the same manner as they are provided
with the services of secretaries and law clerks. The Administrative
Office report also sets out specific conditions for the employment
of regular court reporters for senior district judges and for a
periodic review of their retention in the service of the court. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
report and recommendations of the Administrative Office.
                        CLERKS OF COURT

   The Committee submitted to the Conference a report, prepared
by the Administrative Office, relating to qualification standards
for clerks of court. The report recommended certain qualification
standards for clerks of court which are not mandatory, but which
the Committee believes are firm enough to provide the court with
a guide without detracting from the court's authority in making
a selection. The Conference, after full consideration, approved
the report and the standards set forth therein and instructed the
Director of the Administrative Office to circulate the report to all
judges, clerks of court, and chief deputy clerks.
                NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS

   The Committee submitted for the information of the Conference
a report on salaries paid, outside work performed, and other matters
relating to National Park commissioners. No action on the report
was requested by the Committee.
                  PRETRIAL PROCEDURE
  The Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure, Chief
Judge Alfred P. Murrah, informed the Conference that the fifth
Seminar for Newly Appointed United States District Judges, au­
thorized by the Conference in September 1964 (Conf. Rept., p.
                                 38 

107), is scheduled to be held in Denver, Colo., during the week of
June 28, 1965. This year certain revisions have been made in the
program to enable the new district judges to participate more freely
in the discussions. The format, however, remains basically the
same as that of previous seminars.
   In order to reflect the additional duties and responsibilities as­
signed to the Committee in recent years of conducting seminars
and promoting improved calendaring practices, the Conference,
on motion of Judge Murrah, changed the name of the Committee
from the Committee on Pretrial Procedure to the "Committee on
Trial Practice and Technique."
           SUBCOMMITl'EE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION

   The Subcommittee of the Pretrial Committee appointed to con­
sider discovery problems arising in mUltiple litigation with com­
mon witnesses and exhibits has continued to pursue the planned
course of the national coordination program for the private anti­
trust cases in the electrical equipment industry. Since the last
report of the subcommittee, six additional product lines have been
made the subject of national discovery, three jury trials and one
nonjury trial have been concluded, and another nonjury trial is
underway. Since the last report of the subcommittee approxi­
mately 250 cases have been fully dismissed and numerous partial
settlements of other cases have occurred. Less than one-half of
all claims originally filed now remain pending and the number is
continuing to decline.
   A draft of a bill to add a new section 1407 to Title 28, United
States Code, relating to multi-district litigation, had been sub­
mitted by the subcommittee to the Conference Committees on
Court Administration and Revision of the Laws for their considera"
tion. Conference action on the proposal is shown above under
the report of the Committee on Revision of the Laws.
    PRETERMISSION OF THE TERMS OF COURTS OF 

                   APPEALS 

   At the request of Chief Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., the
Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented to the pretermis­
sion of the term of court of the Court of Appeals of the Fourth
Circuit scheduled to be held at Asheville, N.C., in June 1965.
                                 39 

   At the request of Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, the Confer­
ence consented that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Eighth
Circuit at places other than St. Louis be pretermitted during the
fiscal year commencing July 1, 1965.
   At the request of Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, the Conference
consented that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit
at places other than Denver and Oklahoma City be pretermitted
during the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1965.

           RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
on matters considered at this session where necessary for legislative
or administrative action.
