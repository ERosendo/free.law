                         STATE OF THE DOCKETS

   Courts of Appeals.-Appeals docketed in the United States
courts of appeals during the fiscal year 1965 again increased sharply
to a recorcl6,766 cases, an increase of 12 percent as compared with
the 6,023 appeals docketed in 1964. There were 5,771 appeals
terminated, 71 more than the previous year, but 995 less than the
number of appeals commenced. The result was an increase in the
number of appeals pending in the courts of appeals on June 30, 1965
to a record 4,775.
   Appeals filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit exceeded 1,000 for the second consecutive year. The largest

      791-264--65----2
                                   46 

 increases percentagewise occurred in the Fourth and Ninth Circuits
 where new appeals filed rose 30 percent. The increase in cases
 docketed in the courts of appeals during the last three years has
 been primarily the result of an increase in appeals from decisions of
 the district courts.
   District Courts.-In the United States district courts the civil
cases filed during 1965 leveled off at 67,678. This was an increase of
less than two percent over the number commenced the previous
year. Dispositions were 65,478, or 2,200 cases less than the number
of cases filed. As a result the pending backlog on June 30, 1965
increased to a record 74,395 cases.
   Habeas corpus applications brought by prisoners in custody pur­
suant to the judgment of a state or federal court again increased
sharply, These and other petitions filed by prisoners totalled 7,888
in 1965 or 12 percent of the total civil caseload of the district courts.
   The median time interval from filing to disposition of civil cases
terminated by trial in the district courts in 1965 was 17 months, as
compared with an interval of 16 months in 1964. The median time
interval from issue to trial was 11 months, the same as in the previ­
ous year.
   Criminal cases filed in the district courts in 1965 increased about
five percent, primarily because of the removal of several large
groups of criminal cases from state to federal courts under the
provisions of the Civil Rights Act. If these cases are excluded, the
increase in criminal cases is less than two percent. During the year
there were 30,377 criminal cases filed in the district courts (not
including removals and cases transferred under Rule 20, Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure); 30,862 cases were terminated (ex­
cluding removals and transfers); and on June 30, 1965, 10,834
criminal cases were pending. This is an increase from the 9,578
cases pending at the beginning of the year. The criminal dockets
in the district courts, however, receive priority and for the most part
are current.
   Bankruptcy cases again increased substantially to a record 180,­
323 cases filed, a five percent increase over the 171,719 filed during
1964. There were 175,117 bankruptcy cases closed during the year,
an increase of 12,761 over the previous year. However, filings once
again exceeded terminations by more than 5,000 cases, and the
pending caseload increased for the thirteenth consecutive year to
                                 47 

an all-time high of 162,372. Nonbusiness or consumer bankruptcy
cases accounted for 91 percent of all bankruptcy cases filed.
                    JUDICIAL STATISTICS
  Senior Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman of the Committee
on Judicial Statistics, presented the report of the Committee.
                      ADDITIONAL   J UDGESHllPS
   Judge Johnsen reported that the Committee had given further
study and evaluation to numerous requests and suggestions con­
cerning the need for additional judgeships, both in the courts of
appeals and in the district courts, which had been received since
the last session of the Conference. On the basis of its study, and
in accordance with the policy of making recommendations only
where there is a present or immediate need, the Committee decided
that it would not make any recommendation to the Conference for
the approval of additional judgeships at the present time beyond
the action taken by the Conference at its March 1965 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 3). Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the
Committee on Court Administration concurred in the recommen­
dation of the Committee on Judicial Statistics.
   The Conference considered fully the recommendation of the
Committees and the reports by members of the Conference con­
cerning the workloads in the various circuits and district8. After
full discussion and in view of an increased workload, the Conference
voted to approve the two additional judgeships for the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the two additional judgeships
for the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit contained in S. 1666,
89th Congress, as passed by the Senate. On motion of Chief Judge
Biggs, the Conference authorized the Committees on Judicial Sta­
tistics and Court Administration to undertake a comprehensive
study of the workload of the United States courts of appeals in light
of the additional district judgeship positions created in 1961 and
the proposals for additional district judgeships presently recom­
mended, and, on the basis of its study and evaluation, to recommend
to the Conference any additional appellate judgeships which are
required.
   Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the Conference
withdrew its previous recommendation for the creation of an addi­
tional temporary district judgeship for the State of Alaska. A
                                       48 


new Act of Congress allows the district judge in Alaska, who has
been ill, to include his service as a judge of the United States Dis­
trict Court for the Territory of Alaska in his total years of judicial
service for purposes of retirement under 28 U.S.C. 371 and 372.
He will thus be eligible to retire within approximately one year.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee on Court Administra­
tion the Conference expressed disapproval of H.R. 8385, 89th
Congress, to create two additional district judgeships for the Dis­
trict of Maryland. The Conference has heretofore recommended
the creation of only one additional judgeship for the District of
Maryland.
   A complete list of Conference recommendations for the creation
of additional circuit and district judgeships is as follows:
Courts of Appeals:
    2 additional judgeships for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
    4 additional judgeships for the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the
      first four vacancies occurring thereafter not to be filled.
    2 additional judgeships for the Court of AppeaIs for the Sixth Circuit
    1 additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
DiBtrict Courts:
    First Judicial Circuit:
         1 additional judgeship for the District of Rhode Island
    Second Judicial Circuit:
         1 additional judgeship for the Western District of New York
         1 additional judgeship for the District of Vermont
    Third Judicial Circuit :
         3 additional judgeships for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the
           first three vacancies occurring thereafter not to be filled.
    Fourth Judicial Circuit :
         1 additional judgeship for the District of Maryland
         2 additional judgeships for the Eastern District of Virginia
    Fifth Judicial Circuit:
         1 additional judgeship for the Middle and Southern Districts of Alabama
         1 additional judgeship for the Northern District of Florida
         1 additional judgeship for the Middle District of Florida
         2 additional judgeships for the Southern District of Florida
         1 additional judgeship for the Southern District of Georgia
         4 additional judgeships for the Eastern District of Louisiana
         1 additional judgeship for the Northern District of Mississippi
         2 additional judgeships for the Southern District of Texas
         1 additional judgeship for the Western District of Texas
   Sixth Judicial Circuit:
         1 additional judgeship for the Northern District of Ohio
         1 additional judgeship for the Southern District of Ohio
   Seventh Judicial Circuit:
         1 additional judgeship for the Northern District of Illinois
         1 additional judgeship for the Southern District of Indiana
         1 additional judgeship for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, the first
           vacancy occurring thereafter not to be filled.
                                    49 

    Ninth Judicial Circuit:
        1 additional judgeship for the District of Arizona
    Tenth Judicial Circuit:
       1 additional judgeship for the District of Kansas, the first vacancy
          occurring thereafter not to be filled.
  The Conference has also recommended that the existing roving
judgeship in the State of Florida be made a judgeship for the Mid­
dle District of Florida only and that two additional judicial districts
and four additional jUdgeship positions be created in the State of
California (See Conf. Rept., March 1965, p. 5).
                            TRIAL   REPORTS

   The Conference was informed that a question had been raised
by judges in the Tenth Circuit concerning the need for the monthly
report of trials and pretrial conferences furnished by clerks of
district courts to the Administrative Office. The use of this form
has heretofore been approved by the Committee on Judicial Sta­
tistics and by the Conference. The Committee reported that after
hearing, discussing, and considering some of the views expressed,
it was of the opinion that the use of the form ought to be continued,
as serving to provide an aspect of information, in conjunction
with other aspects, of the full nature and scope of the work of the
district courts.
                  MOTIONS TO VACATE SENTENCE

   The Conference at its March 1964 session (Conf. Rept., p. 40)
approved a recommendation of the Committee "that motions to
vacate sentence, brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255, and applications
for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, be docketed and that rulings
on these matters be made only after they have been docketed."
Some district courts were reported to have construed this recom­
mendation to imply that habeas corpus petitions and motions to
vacate sentence may be filed without an authorization by the cO,urt
for the petitioner to proceed in forma pauperis.
   Judge Johnsen informed the Conference that in making its rec­
ommendation the Committee had no intention of suggesting that
the requirement for an order to proceed in forma pauperis, 28 U.S.C.
1915, may be ignored. The recommendation merely was directed
at eliminating the practice in prisoner cases of making perfunctory
evaluations of the question of merit on an in forma pauperis appli­
                                 50 

cation and at having the matter disposed of instead in the same
manner as if the filing fee had been paid in a case where the
requirements of 28 U.S.C. 1915 had been met.
                JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
   The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief Judge
William J. Campbell, submitted to the Conference the appropria­
tion estimates for the judiciary (exclusive of the Supreme Court
and the Customs Court) for the fiscal year 1967. The estimates,
which had been prepared by the Director of the Administrative
Office pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 605, and which were examined and
approved by the Committee, total $86,047,100, an increase of
$9,056,100 over the amount appropriated for the fiscal year 1966.
On recommendation of the Committee, the appropriation estimates
presented for the fiscal year 1967 were approved by the Conference.
   The Director of the Administrative Office was further authorized
to revise the budget estimates for the fiscal year 1967, and to
submit to Congress estimates of supplemental appropriations re­
quired for any purpose which could not be anticipated at the time
of this submission. The Committee was further authorized to
release immediately any information contained in its report and
any other information that may be necessary in the preparation
and presentation of supplemental and annual appropriation re­
quests to the Congress.
   The appropriation estimates for the fiscal year 1967 include funds
for 9 additional deputy clerks, 33 additional law clerks, 33 stenog­
raphers and 36 messengers for the courts of appeals; 32 additional
deputy clerks for the district courts; and 60 additional probation
officers and 45 clerk-stenographers for the probation service.
Funds are also included for two additional positions for the Court
of Customs and Patent Appeals and one position for the Court of
Claims. The estimates for the Administrative Office contain a
provision for the appointment of an "executive secretary" and a
clerk-stenographer in each of the judicial circuits to assist in the
administration of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964. Provision
also has been made to augment the Administrative Office stafi to
cope with an increase in workload and for other purposes.
                                  51
           ApPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR         1966
   For the fiscal year 1966 thf'l Congress appropriated to the
 judiciary, exclusive of the Supreme Court, the sum of $78,150,400.
 This was $7,158,600 less than the amount requested, but $5,252,800
 more than the obligational authority granted for the previous year.
   As originally approved by the House of Representatives, the
 appropriation bill provided for the employment of 20 additional
 deputy clerks for the district courts, 30 probation officers and 23
 clerk-stenographers for the probation service. The original esti­
mates, however, contemplated 25 additional deputy clerks for the
 district courts, 90 probation officers and 68 clerk-stenographers for
 the probation service. Requests for funds for the employment of
 15 additional deputy clerks, 33 law clerks, 33 stenographers and
36 messengers for the courts of appeals were denied. The bill, as
thus approved, included the sum of $3,500,000 for the payment of
fees and expenses of court appointed counsel pursuant to the
Criminal Justice Act of 1964. This sum was $3,540,000 less than
the budget estimate. The sum of $77,600 was authorized for the
Administrative Office for additional clerical positions required for
the administration of the Criminal Justice Act, but the request for
funds for the appointment of executive secretaries and clerk­
stenographers in each of the judicial circuits was denied.
   The Senate subsequently restored $82,000 to permit the employ­
ment of 11 additional deputy clerks for the United States courts
of appeals. No appeal was made for the restoration of funds for
other positions which were denied by the House. The Senate,
however, reduced the funds available for the fees and expenses of
counsel appointed pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act of 1964
from $3,500,000 to $3,000,000. The House subsequently acceded
to the amendments of the Senate.
   The Conference was informed that in the event the amount
appropriated for the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act
of 1964 should prove to be inadequate, a request for a supplemental
appropriation will be made to the Congress. The report of the
Budget Committee was received and approved by the Conference.

        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
 Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing Com­
mittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, presented to the
                                52 

Conference the recommendations of the Committee and a report
on the activities of the standing and advisory Committees on Rules
of Practice and Procedure. Judge Maris informed the Conference
that Mr. William E. Foley, Deputy Director of the Administrative
Office, had been appointed Secretary to the standing Committee
and ex officio Secretary to the advisory committees, succeeding
Mr. Will Shafroth who resigned as Secretary following his retire­
ment last year as Deputy Director of the Administrative Office.
The Committee expressed its gratitude to Mr. Shafroth for his
excellent service on behalf of the Committee during the last two
years.
FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE--UNIFICATION OF CmL AND
                     ADMIRALTY PROCEDURE

   The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules had submitted
to the standing Committee, with its favorable recommendation,
and with the approval of the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules,
a definitive draft of proposed amendments to certain of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure designed to effect the unification of the
admiralty and civil procedure. The draft was accompanied by a
draft of proposed supplemental rules dealing with certain unique
admiralty procedures which the Advisory Committee on Admiralty
Rules believes should be preserved for maritime claims.
   In addition, the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules submitted,
with its favorable recommendation, and with the approval of the
Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules, a definitive draft of
certain other amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Also, the reporter for the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules,
at the request of the standing Committee, submitted a draft of
proposed amendments to Rules 73,74,75 and 81, Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, designed to incorporate therein improvements in
appellate procedure which the Advisory Committee on Appellate
Rules has approved. All proposals were accompanied by explana­
tory advisory committee notes approved by the respective advisory
committees. With the exception of certain proposed amendments
to Rules 43(a), 65(f) and the rescission of the Copyright Rules,
all proposals to amend the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were
approved by the standing Committee. The standing Committee
also approved the rescission of Rule 6( c), Federal Rules of Civil
                                 53 

Procedure; Rule 2 of the Copyright Rules; and the existing Ad­
miralty Rules.
   Upon recommendation of the standing Committee, the Confer­
ence approved the proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure including the recommendation for the rescission
of the existing Admiralty Rules, of Rule 2 of the Copyright Rules,
and of Rule 6(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and di­
rected that these proposals be transmitted to the Supreme Court
with the recommendation that they be adopted.
   Judge Maris informed the Conference that the Advisory Com­
mittee on Civil Rules is continuing its study of other areas of civil
procedure, particularly the field of depositions and discovery. The
Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules will continue with its
study of distinctive maritime procedures that have been included
in the supplemental admiralty rules.

                   RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

   The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules had submitted to
the standing Committee, with its favorable recommendation, a
definitive draft of proposed amendments to certain of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure designed to improve the criminal
procedure and to bring these rules into conformity with the Crimi­
nal Justice Act of 1964 and recent decisions of the Supreme Court.
In addition, the reporter of the Advisory Committee on Appellate
Rules, at the request of the standing Committee, had submitted a
draft of proposed amendments to Rules 37 and 45, Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, designed to incorporate therein certain im­
provements in appellate procedure which the Advisory Committee
on Appellate Rules has approved. All proposals were accompani~d
by explanatory advisory committee notes approved by the respec­
tive advisory committees.
   With the exception of the proposed new Rule 12.1 and proposed
amendments to Rules 15 and 23(b) , Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, all proposed amendments recommended by the advisory
committees, including the rescission of Rule 45(c), were approved
by the standing Committee. Upon recommendation of the stand­
ing Committee, the Conference approved the proposed amendments
to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and directed that they
be transmitted to the Supreme Court with the recommendation
that they be adopted.

      UNIFORM RULES OF FEDERAL ApPELLATE PROCEDURE

  Judge Maris informed the Conference that the Advisory Com­
mittee on Appellate Rules is engaged in the final stage of modify­
ing and perfecting its draft of uniform Rules of Federal Appellate
Procedure which were published and circulated to the bench and
bar in March 1964. As indicated above, the proposals of the ad­
visory committee which involve the initial stage of the appellate
proces&-the period from the filing of the notice of appeal in the
district court to the lodging of the record in the court of appeals­
are incorporated in the proposed amendments to the Federal Rules
of Civil and Criminal Procedure.

               RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE

  As a result of legislation, approved October 3, 1964, authorizing
the Supreme Court to promulgate rules of practice and procedure
under the Bankruptcy Act, the Advisory Committee on Bank­
ruptcy Rules has now undertaken the formulation of a complete
set of bankruptcy rules. Previously the advisory committee had
been engaged in preparing revisions of the General Orders and
Official Forms in Bankruptcy. It is expected that the new task
will require considerable additional time and effort to complete.

                  UNIFORM RULES OF EVIDENCE

   The Advisory Committee on Uniform Rules of Evidence for the
United States District Courts has now been appointed and Pro­
fessor Edward W. Cleary of the University of Illinois Law School
has been named reporter for the committee. The Conference was
informed that the committee has held an organizational meeting
and is preparing to go forward with its work.

                 COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration, Chief
Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the report of the Committee.

                     RETIREMENT OF JUDGES

  Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the Committee
on the Judiciary of the United States Senate had requested the
views of the Conference on S. 2299, 89th Congress, to provide for
                                  55 

 the mandatory retirement of district judges of the United States
 for permanent physical or mental disability. Another bill, H.R.
 10117, 89th Congress, which would authorize the President to
appoint an additional judge in any court where there is a judge
who is unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by
 reason of permanent mental or physical disability, is pending before
 the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.
   The Conference at its March 1964 session (Conf. Rept., p. 9)
requested the Committee Hto undertake a comprehensive survey
and study of the problems arising in the expeditious disposition of
the judicial business of a United States Court (other than the
Supreme Court) where a judicial officer becomes unable to dis­
charge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of permanent
mental or physical disability." The Committee was also requested
"to undertake a similar comprehensive survey and study of the
problems arising in the administration of justice in a United States
court (other than the Supreme Court) where a judicial officer is
guilty of misbehavior in office" and "to review the adequacy of
existing statutory and administrative procedures relating to these
problems and to formulate and recommend to the Conference
improvements in these procedures."
   The Committee reported that it has a number of matters under
consideration but was not prepared to report at this time. The
Committee accordingly requested and was granted leave to con­
sider the proposals contained in S. 2299 and H.R. 10117 and"related
matters and to report thereon at the next session of the Conference.
DISQUALIFICATION OF A CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR BIAS AND PREJUDICE

   The Conference at its March 1965 session (Conf. Rept., p. 7)
voted to disapprove S. 578, 89th Congress, which would amend
28 U.S.C. 47(a) to provide means for the disqualification of a
circuit judge for bias or prejudice. On August 12, 1965, a hearing
on the bill was held before the Subcommittee on Improvements
in Judicial Machinery of the Committee on the Judiciary of the
United States Senate with several witnesses appearing on behalf
of the bill. Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the matters
brought out at the hearings were considered by the Committees
on Court Administration and Revision of the Laws and that the
Committees again recommended that S. 578 be disapproved on
the ground that the bill is not needed and that it would enable
                                 56 

litigants to disrupt the procedures of the courts of appeals. This
recommendation was approved by the Conference.

                   CHIEF JUDGES OF CIRCUITS

   H.R. 7641, H.R. 7810 and H.R. 8712, 89th Congress, would
amend 28 U.S.C. 45(a) to provide that chief judges of circuits
should relinquish their duties at age 66 instead of age 70. The
bills, as drafted, would not take effect until the expiration of five
years from the date of enactment. The Committees on Court
Administration and Revision of the Laws were of the view that the
matter requires further study. They, therefore, requested and
were granted leave by the Conference to consider the proposal
further and to report at a future session of the Conference.

             JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY SYSTEM

   Chief Judge Biggs called attention to the Third Actuarial Valua­
tion of the Judicial Survivors Annuity System, as of December 31,
1964, prepared by the actuarial staff of the Social Security Admin­
istration in accordance with the statute, 28 U.S.C. 376. The report
indicates that in approximately seven years disbursements from
the annuity fund will rise at a faster rate than income will accrue,
and that the fund will be completely exhausted by 1984. The
matter was considered at length by the Committee on Court
Administration, which suggested that the report be referred to a
Conference committee for study and report as to what course
should be pursued to maintain the solvency of the fund. The re­
port on the annuity fund was thereupon referred to the Committee
on Court Administration for study and report to the Conference.
                   PLACES OF HOLDING CoURT

   S. 2070, 89th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 122 to add Rapid
City as an additional place of holding court in the Western Division
of the United States District Court for the District of South
Dakota. The Conference was informed that the bill had been
approved by the Judicial Council of the Eighth Circuit. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
bill.
                                 57

           REALIGNMENT OF COUNTIES IN OKLAHOMA

   The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representa­
tives requested the views of the Conference on H.R. 8317, 89th
Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 116 to realign the counties of the
Eastern and Western Districts of Oklahoma. A similar bill,
S. 2049, 89th Congress, is pending before the Judiciary Committee
of the United States Senate. Both bills have the approval of the
Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit. Upon recommendation of
the Committee, the Conference voted to approve the proposals
contained in these bills.
             QUARTERS OF THE COURTS OF ApPEALS

   The Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit requested permission
to release space assigned to it in the courthouse at Asheville, North
Carolina. At the present time the facilities are inadequate and the
space assigned for judges' chambers is occupied by employees of
the National Park Service. It was the view of the Judicial Council
that it would be an extraordinarily needless waste of money to
provide adequate facilities for the Court of Appeals at Asheville
in view of the small number of appeals that would be heard there.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference author­
ized the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to relinquish the
space assigned to it at Asheville, North Carolina.
                   LAND CoNDEMNATION CASES

  H.R. 8704, 89th Congress, would provide that notwithstanding
any provision of Rule 71A(h), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
a defendant in a land condemnation proceeding shall be entitled
to a trial by jury of the issue of just compensation ttby filing a
demand therefor within the time allowed for answer, or within
such further time as the court may allow." Similar bills have been
disapproved by the Conference on previous occasions. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved
the bill.
     RELEASE OF INFORMATION BY GOVERNMENT AGENOIES

  H.R. 6172, 89th Congress, would confer jurisdiction upon the
district courts to enjoin a federal agency from withholding infor­
                                 58 

mation from any person seeking information from it. Under the
provisions of the bill the burden would be placed upon the agency
to sustain its action. It was the view of the Conference that
problems of the release of information should be dealt with as
matters of administration rather than judicial proceedings. Ac­
cordingly, the Conference voted to disapprove H.R. 6172 and
similar bills pending in the 89th Congress, including H.R. 5012
through 5021, H.R. 5406, H.R. 5520 and H.R. 5583.

                  ELECTRONIC SOUND RECORDING

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the bill to authorize the use
of electronic sound recording in the United States district courts,
recommended by the Conference, had been amended in the Con­
gress and enacted into law, Public Law 89-163. The amendments
to the bill permit the use of electronic sound recording only to
augment recording by shorthand or by mechanical means. The
new Act, however, permits an electronic sound recording of pro­
ceedings on arraignment, plea and sentence in a criminal case, when
properly certified by the court reporter, to be admissible to estab­
lish the record of that part of the proceedings. The bill will thus
eliminate, in all cases where electronic sound recording equipment
is used, the present requirement that the court reporter transcribe
and file transcripts of arraignment, plea and proceedings in con­
nection with the imposition of sentence in criminal cases.

                  REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on
Revision of the Laws, submitted the report of the Committee.

                          PATENT CASES

   S. 1971, 89th Congress, would amend 35 U.S.C. 103 to remove the
initial determination of the question of "obviousness" of an inven­
tion from the jurisdiction of the Commi~ioner of Patents and make
it a matter solely for judicial determination after the grant of a
patent. This change in existing law was suggested because of the
large backlog of pending patent applications resulting from the de­
tailed investigations conducted by the Patent Office to resolve the
issue. It was the view of the Committees on Court Administration
and Revision of the Laws that the proposal, if enacted, would
                                  59 


increase greatly the volume of patent litigation in the district
courts, which would then be called upon to decide initially the issue
of "obviousness" without the advantage of the research and reason­
ing of the Patent Office. The Committee pointed out that, in
addition, the jurisdiction of the two courts having the greatest
experience in deciding this issue, the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals and the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia, would be eliminated. Upon recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference disapproved the bill.

          INTERNATIONAL RULES OF JUDICIAL PROCEDURE

   The Secretary of State requested the views of the Conference on
the draft Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra­
judicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, proposed by
The Hague Conference on Private International Law held October
7-28, 1964. The Committee reported that the proposals contained
in this Convention are in accord with the provisions of the recently
adopted subdivision (i) of Rule 4, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
and with the amendments made to various federal statutes by the
Act of October 3, 1964, Public Law 88-619. It was the view of the
Committee that the Convention will facilitate the prosecution in
American courts of litigation having international aspects. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference voted to ap­
prove the draft Convention.

        JURISDwrION OF CIVIL AcrrONS BY INDIAN TRIBES

   S. 1356, H.R. 10007, H.R. 10077, and H.R. 10348, 89th Congress,
would amend the Judicial Code to permit Indian tribes to maintain
civil actions in the United States district courts without regard to
the $10,000 jurisdictional limitation. The Committee expressed
the view that the elimination of the $10,000 jurisdictional limitation
upon civil litigation by Indian tribes would present no difficulty of
judicial administration and would be in line with the more recently
enacted statutes conferring federal question jurisdiction, which do
not contain a monetary limitation. The Committee suggested,
however, that the proposed new Section 1361 of Title 28, U.S.C.,
as set out in S. 1356, be numbered Section 1362, to avoid conflict
with an existing Section 1361 in the Code. The Conference there­
upon approved the bill with the modification suggested by the
Committee.
                                 60 

                  1iORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CASES

  S. 1473, 89th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 2410 to prescribe
the relative priority of liens of the United St.ates and claims for
certain costs, expenses and attorneys' fees in mortgage foreclosure
actions. The Committee pointed out that while the proposal ap­
pears meritorious, the bill involves only a small segment of the
much larger problem of the priority of liens of the United States.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference adopted
the view that the proposal should be dealt with in consideration of
the entire problem and not as an isolated matter, and directed that
the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate, which had
requested the views of the Conference, be so informed.

                       BANKS AND BANKING

   S. 1907 and H.R. 6849, 89th Congress, would add a new Section
2415 to the Judicial Code to provide that the United States courts
may not restrain a bank or a banking association with respect to
property or rights to property of any depositor in accounts main­
tained at branches of such banks in foreign countries unless com­
pliance with such restraint will not violate foreign law or involve
civil liability under the law of the country in which the branch is
located. The Committee was of the view that the problem to which
these bills are addressed is one of policy involving American foreign
relations. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that the
Conference take no position on the bill and so advise the Judiciary
Committee of the United States Senate, which had requested the
views of the Conference. This recommendation was approved by
the Conference.
CONSOLIDATION OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS
                               BOARD

   The Civil Aeronautics Board has proposed legislation, H.R.10929,
89th Congress, to relieve the Board from strict compliance with the
rule set out in Ashbacker Radio Co. v. F.C.C., 326 U.S. 327 (1945),
which requires a consolidated or comparative hearing in a situa­
tion where there is more than one application before the Board
for the same certificate of public convenience and necessity. 'fhe
bill would authorize separate hearings of these applications, if the
hearings are followed by simultaneous decisions. The proposed
                                  61 

legislation is predicated upon Recommendation No. 20 of the
Administrative Conference of the United States, December 15,
1962. The Committee pointed out that the recommendation by
the Administrative Conference included a provision authorizing
intervention as of right in the case of separate hearings of such
applications. The Committee recommended that the bill be
amended to include this provision and that as amended, the bill be
approved. This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
                      AVIATION AND SPACE LAW

  The Bureau of the Budget requested the views of the Conference
on a draft bill to provide federal jurisdiction and a body of uniform
federal law for cases arising out of aviation and space activities.
The Committee reported that the draft bill involves matters of
considerable difficulty and doubt in a field which is presently on the
verge of rapid expansion. The Conference, thereupon, voted to
take no position on the draft bill at this time.
                    ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE

   H.R. 9240, 89th Congress, would make admissible in evidence,
without further authentication, the slip laws published by the
General Services Administration and the Treaties and other
International Act series, issued by the Secretary of State. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
bill.

    (7) H.R. 7538, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 2072 and

   (8) H.R. 7618, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 2241 with
respect to the jurisdiction and venue of an application for a writ

 mark cases. The proposals embodied in these bills were approved
 in substance by the Conference in March 1964. (Con£. Rept.,
 p. 16.)
    The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, re­
 affirmed its disapproval of the proposals contained in the following
 bills pending in the 89th Congress which embody proposals hereto­
 fore disapproved by the Conference:
     (1) S. 1345, 89th Congress, to accord the right to a trial by jury

 by the determination of the issue of just compensation by a com­
mission appointed by a district court under Rule 71A(h), Federal

Congress, disapproved by the Conference in March 1964. (Conf.

tive procedures proposed in the bill, but disapproved the provision
for judicial review. (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1963, p. 73.)
    (4) H.R. 7296, 89th Congress, to provide for the enforcement of
support orders in certain state and federal courts and to make it a

expressed disapproval of those provisions of the proposed legisla­
tion which would provide for the registration and enforcement of
support orders by United States district courts. (Con£. Rept.,
March 1965, p.17.)
    (5) H.R. 7646, H.R. 8402 and H.R. 9871, 89th Congress, to
amend the so-called Wunderlich Act to provide for the full adjudi­
cation of the rights of Government contractors in courts of law.
(Conf. Rept., March 1965, Pi 17.)

the District of Hawaii. (Conf. Rept., March 1965, p. 8.)
    (7) S. 2375, 89th Congress, to waive the statute of limitations
on certain claims of any officer who is a member of a reserve com­
                                  64 

ponent of the uniform services of the United States.     (Conf. Rept.,
March 1965, p.16.)
                   COURT OF VETERANS ApPEALS

   The Judiciary Committee of the United State Senate requested
the views of the Conference on S. 2258, 89th Congress, which is a
bill to establish a Court of Veterans Appeals and to prescribe its
jurisdiction and functions. This bill is identical to H.R. 8091 and
H.R. 8192, 89th Congress, which are pending in the House of Rep­
resentatives. Similar bills were considered by the Conference at
its session in March 1965 (Con£. Rept., p. 18) and approved as to
the type of review which will be provided by a special Court of
Veterans Appeals, with local hearings by commissioners of the
court. The Conference, however, refrained from expressing any
view on the policy of granting appeals in veterans' cases. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference voted to re­
affirm the views which it previously expressed.

        INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
   The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Intercircuit As­
signments, Circuit Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported on the
processing of requests for intercircuit assignments for the period
February 6, 1965 through July 30, 1965. During this period the
Committee recommended favorably on 24 assignments which have
been, or will be, undertaken by 19 judges. All assignments rec­
ommended by the Committee were approved by the Chief Justice.
The judges receiving assignments include seven circuit judges, four
senior circuit judges, five district judges, two senior district judges,
one senior judge of the Court of Claims, and one senior judge of the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
   Of the 24 assignments which have been, or will be, undertaken,
12 were for service in the courts of appeals. Of these, seven
were for service in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit where
there have been two vacancies in judgeship positions. No assign­
ments were made in connection with the national deposition pro­
gram in the electrical equipment antitrust cases.
   The Committee noted that the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit continues to need help from without the circuit to cope with
its heavy caseload, even though two vacancies on the court have
recently been filled. Additional assistance may also be needed in
                                 65 

the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the Court of Ap­
peals for the Sixth Circuit if these courts are to be kept abreast of
their dockets.
   The Conference was also informed that the number of inter­
circuit assignments of retired judges has continued to decline.
Only two of the 50 retired district judges and only four of the 26
retired circuit judges accepted assignments outside of their circuits
during the period covered by the report. The Committee suggested
that, if service by retired judges is to be encouraged, consideration
be given to the desirability of a review of the policies pertaining to
the staff and facilities furnished retired judges.
   The Committee reported that the numerous forms now being
used in the submission of requests for intercircuit assignments have
caused confusion and delay. The Committee, accordingly, prepared
two new forms, one a certificate of need and the other a grant of
consent (except a consent by a senior judge) and suggested that the
use of these simplified forms be approved.
   With respect to the solicitation of assistance of judges of other
circuits, the Committee noted that it continues to work only
through the chief judges. The Committee suggested that if solici­
tations for assistance are not made through the Committee, greater
cooperation probably will be secured by initiating the request with
the chief judge of the circuit and refraining from the solicitation
of individual judges until the consent of the chief judge is obtained.
In the case of a retired judge, however, only his consent, and not
that of the chief judge, is required. The report of the Committee,
including a statement relating to the need for intercircuit assign­
ments and the availability of judges for such service, was received
and approved by the Conference.

             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
  Senior Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., Chairman of the Committee
on Bankruptcy Administration, reported that the Committee had
met and considered the recoffimendations contained in the survey
report of the Director of the Administrative Office, dated June 22,
1965, relating to the continuance of referee positions to become
vacant by expiration of term, for new referee positions, and for
changes in salaries and arrangements for referees. The Committee
also considered the recommendations of the district judges and of
the judicial councils of the circuits concerned.
                                       66 

  The Conference considered fully the Committee's report and the
recommendations of the Director, the judicial councils and the
district judges. On the basis of the report and recommendations,
the Conference took the following action relating to new referee
positions, changes in arrangements for existing referee positions
and the filling of referee positions to become vacant by expiration
of term, and directed that, unless otherwise noted, the changes

ferred action on the proposal to establish an additional full-time

approved the proposal to create an additional full-time referee
position in the District of Kansas.
                               ApPROPRIATIONS

  The Conference was advised that the $10,739,000 appropriated
for the operation of the bankruptcy system during the fiscal year
                                68 

1966, although $510,000 less than the appropriation estimates,
appears to be adequate. For the fiscal year 1966 receipts into the
Referees' Salary and Expense Fund are expected to equal or exceed
estimated obligations. As of June 30, 1965 the Referees' Salary
and Expense Fund was reported to have a credit balance of
$10,720,690.
                           LEGISLATION


   The Committee reported on the following bills introduced during
the first session of the 89th Congress, which had not previously
been brought to the attention of the Conference:
   (1) H.R. 20, 89th Congress, to amend Sections 14c(5), 656(a)
(3) and 661 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 32(c) (5), 1056(a)
(3) and 1061). This bill would resolve a conflict in judicial
decisions on the question of whether Section 656(a)(3) of the
Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 1056(a) (3), bars confirmation of a
wage earner's plan, by way of extension, when the debtor has
received a discharge in bankruptcy within the previous six years.
The bill would codify the view expressed in a number of cases
that the Congressional policy of encouraging payment of debts in
full, pursuant to plans by way of extension, ought to be as fully
recognized when the question is whether such a plan should be
confirmed, as when the issue is the effect of a prior confirmation
of a plan by way of extension on the right to a subsequent dis­
charge. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved the bill.
   (2) H.R. 291, 89th Congress, to amend Sections Ma, 238, 378
and 483 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 104(a), 638, 778 and
883) and to repeal Sections 354 and 459 (11 U.S.C. 755 and 859).
This bill, sponsored by the National Bankruptcy Conference, would
make clarifying changes with respect to the priority of the costs
of administration incurred under a special relief chapter of the
Bankruptcy Act following an adjudication therein. The provi­
sions in the bill would clarify the procedure for the selection of a
trustee in a Chapter X proceeding, place a duty on a trustee or
receiver to file a schedule and statement of unpaid obligations in­
curred in contracts assumed during a Chapter X proceeding, clarify
the power of a trustee to assume or review executory contracts
following an adjudication in Chapter X, and add two new sections
with respect to the filing of claims in Chapter X proceedings.
                                  69 

Similar changes would be made in provisions of the Act pertaining
to Chapter XI. and Chapter XII proceedings. Upon recommenda­
tion of the Committee, the Conference voted to approve the bill.
   (3) H.R. 5646, 89th Congress, would amend Sections 334, 355,
367, and 369 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 734, 755, 767 and
769), to make flexible the time within which claims in Chapter XI
proceedings may be filed. The bill, sponsored by the National
Bankruptcy Conference, would also increase the time within which
the first meeting of creditors is to be held. Upon recommendation
of the Committee, the Conference approved the bilL
   (4) H.R. 293, 89th Congress, to amend Sections 337 and 338
of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 737 and 738), to make clarifying
changes with respect to the functions of creditors' committees and
the expenses incurred by such committees in the administration of
proceedings brought under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act.
The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, deferred
action on the bill pending further study by the Committee.
   (5) H.R. 8121, 89th Congress, to amend Section 656(a) of the
Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 1056(a), relating to the confirmation
of a wage earner's plan under Chapter XIII of the. Bankruptcy
Act. It was the view of the Committee that the proposal con­
tained in the bill, which is broad and unlimited in scope, would
give a debtor the right to obtain repeated relief under Chapter
XIII by way of a composition at any time. The bill would thus
override and eliminate the six year restriction period with respect
to a composition under Chapter XIII by nullifying the application
of Section 14c(5) to Chapter XIII cases. The Committee further
believes that the bill would create a class of habitual debtors seek­
ing relief under Chapter XIII and the discharge of debts. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference voted to dis­
approve the bill.
                   ::FEEs   AND SPECIAL CHARGES

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee,
adopted the following changes in the Schedule of Fees and Special
Charges in bankruptcy cases:
    (1) Pursuant to Section 37b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
65(b), the Schedule of Fees to be charged in arrangement cases,
filed under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, was amended to
read as follows:
                                       70 

      One and one-half percent on total obligations paid or extended in Chapter
   XI cases filed from July 1, 1947 to December 31, 1953, inclusive.
      One percent on total obligations paid or extended in Chapter XI cases
   filed from Joouarll 1, 195~ through December 31, 1965.
     One percent on the first One Hundred Thousood doUars of total obZigatiom
   paid or extended in Ohapter XI cases, and one-half of one percent on the
   balance in aU cases filed on and after January 1, 1966.

  Chief Judge Bailey Aldrich did not participate in the vote to
amend this section of the schedule of fees and special charges.
  (2) Pursuant to Section 40c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
68(c)(3), item 3 of the Schedule of Charges for Special Services,
approved by the Conference in September 1947 (Conf. Rept., p.
13), was amended, effective October 1, 1965, to read as follows:
     3. For fiUng petitions for review, for filing petitions for reclamation of
   property and for filing petitions for leave to foredose a mortgage, $10 for
   each petition filed, to be paid at the time of filing by the petitioner, provided
   that no charge shall be made for petitions for review or for reclamation of
   property or for leave to forecl0ge filed on behalf of the United States.
   (3) Pursuant to Sections 40c (2) and (3) of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U.S.C. 68(c) (2) and (3), the Schedule of Charges for
Special Services in reopened bankruptcy cases was amended, effec­
tive October 1, 1965, to read as follows:
     There shall be deposited with the clerk, at the tlme a petition is filed to
   reopen any closed bankruptcy proceeding (a) $32 for each estate for the
   referees' salary and expense fund; (b) $10 for each estate for the trustee's
   fee; (c) $8 for each estate for the clerk's filing fee. Where applicable, all
   additional and special charges prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the
   United States pursuant to section 4Oc(2) and 40c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act,
   as amended, shall also be charged for the referees' salary and expense fund
   based upon the rates in effect on the date the case is reopened.

                     MA'ITERS UNDER ADVISEMENT

  The Conference was informed of a marked improvement in the
number of matters held under advisement for more than sixty days
by referees in bankruptcy. The list of these matters reported
under advisement on March 31, 1965 is the smallest since the re­
ports were inaugurated. No referee reported having more than
three matters under advisement more than sixty days as of that
date.
                    AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   The Conference was informed that the Bankruptcy Division of
the Administrative Office is continuing the examination of statis­
tical reports of closed bankruptcy cases for the detennination of
                                  71 

errors in the computation of amounts due the Referees' Salary and
Expense Fund and overpayments of compensation to receivers and
trustees. The statistical reports are also being analyzed for the
purpose of disclosing a monopoly of appointments of trustees in
any district. Information is also being assembled with respect to
the compensation of trustees in large metropolitan areas.

           DEVEWPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER XIII
   The Committee reported a gradual increase in the use of wage
earners' plans under Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act. During
the last fiscal year 28,027 Chapter XIII cases were filed, compared
with 27,292 in 1964. The guidelines for Chapter XIII administra­
tion, promUlgated at the September 1963 session of the Conference
(Conf. Rept., p. 87), are being complied with generally by the
courts. In several large metropolitan areas, however, the courts
have not reduced the number of persons appointed as trustees in
Chapter XIII cases to one trustee for the area, as recommended by
the Conference. A further report will be made by the Bankruptcy
Division of the Administrative Office to the Committee at its next
meeting.
                       SEMINAR FOR REFEREES
  Judge Hamlin informed the Conference that the Second Seminar
for Referees in Bankruptcy, held in Washington, D.C. on March
29--April 2, 1965, was as fully successful as the first. Altogether,
there were 44 referees in attendance. Plans are now being made
for a third seminar to be held in Washington during the week of
March 27-Aprill, 1966. In addition, several regional seminars are
being planned for referees who have previously attended one of the
annual seminars.

                    CoSTS   OF   AnMDNISTRATION
   The Committee called attention to the study of costs incurred
in the administration of· bankruptcy asset cases during the fiscal
year 1964, which was recently distributed to all judges and referees.
This study shows that in 1964 the percentage cost of administra­
tion of bankruptcy asset cases increased to 26.6 percent in cases
having an average realization of $4,840. This compares with a
percentage cost in 1963 of 26.4 percent in asset cases having an
average realization of $5,511. The Committee suggested that every

district court examine the items of cost which according to the study
appear to be higher than the national average in their jurisdiction,
with a view to reducing the expense of administration to the lowest
level consistent with good administration.

      ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office, on
behalf of Circuit Judge William F. Smith, Chairman of the Com­
mittee on the Administration of the Criminal Law, presented the
report of the Committee.

                         RELEASE ON BAIL

   S. 1357, 89th Congress, would revise and improve existing bail
practices in the courts of the United States. The bill would au­
thorize the release of an accused on one or more of the following
conditions: (1) the execution of a written promise to appear as
required; (2) the execution of a personal recognizance; (3) the
execution of a personal recognizance coupled with the deposit of
cash or security equal to ten percentum of the amount of the
recognizance, with the deposit to be refunded upon the performance
of the release condition; (4) under the supervision of a probation
officer; and (5) in the custody of a third person.
  The Conference was informed that the bill had passed the Senate
with certain modifications which the Committee reported were
desirable. The Conference, thereupon, approved S. 1357 in the
form in which it passed the Senate.
                   ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING

   H.R. 4348, 89th Congress, would provide that evidence obtained
through the use of electronic eavesdropping by means of concealed
microphones or recording devices is inadmissible in the trial of a
person charged with the commission of an offense against the
United States. The Committee reported that the bill would
abrogate existing law and in particular two decisions of the Su­
preme Court approving the use of this equipment in certain situa­
tions, Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129 (1942) and On
Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747 (1952). It was the view of
the Committee that there are areas of law enforcement in which
the use of eavesdropping devices should be permitted and that for
                                 73 

this reason the proposed legislation is too broad. Upon recom­
mendation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved the bill.
                     IMMUNITY LmISLATION

   S. 2190, 89th Congress, would permit the compelling of testi­
mony with respect to certain crimes and the granting of immunity
in connection therewith, but only with the approval of the Attorney
General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by him. The
Conference discussed the constitutional aspects of the proposed
legislation and voted to defer consideration of the bill until the
next session of the Conference.
                         NARCOTICS LAWS

   S. 2152, 89th Congress, would amend the Criminal Code to
 make available to the district courts a range of expedients adapt­
 able to the individualized treatment of criminal offenders who are
 found to be addicted to the use of narcotic drugs. Included in the
bill are procedures for the civil commitment of an "eligible indi­
vidual" (as defined in the bill) to the custody of the Surgeon
General for treatment. During the period of treatment the prose­
cution on pending criminal charges would be held in abeyance.
If the Surgeon General thereafter certifies that the individual has
successfully completed treatment, he could then be discharged
from custody and the pending criminal charges against him
dismissed.
   The Conference was informed that the procedures set up under
the bill would apply in the case of any person who is an addict
whether or not the offense charged is related to his addiction.
It was the view of the Committee that a person should not be
relieved of the obligation to answer a criminal charge merely
because he is an addict, and that the availability of the provisions
under the bill would place a premium on drug addiction, and would
result in an inequality in the administration of criminal justice.
The Committee recommended, therefore, that the provisions of the
bill be made available only where it is found by the court that the
criminal charge is related to narcotic addiction.
   The Conference, thereupon, approved the bill with the modifica­
tion suggested by the Committee.
                                 74
                 RIGHTS OF THE MENTALLY ILL

   S.1109, 89th Congress, would amend Section 24-301 (d), District
of Columbia Code, to make discretionary with the court the con­
finement in a mental hospital of an accused person acquitted of
crime solely on the ground of insanity. This section of
the District of Columbia Code now provides that such person
"shall" be confined to a mental hospital. The Committee was of
the view that confinement to a mental hospital should be author­
ized only if, after hearing, it is determined that the accused was
insane at the time of acquittal and that his insanity was such
that this release would be a threat to the health, safety, or morals
of the community. The Committee, therefore, recommended that
the bill be further amended to require a hearing by the trial judge
on the issue of insanity as of the time of acquittal and that the
bill, as amended, be approved. This recommendation was ap­
proved by the Conference.
                 ACADEMY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

  S. 1288, 89th Congress, would provide for the establishment of
an Academy of Criminal Justice as an agency of the United States
to be located at a law school selected by the President. The bill
would also provide for the establishment of branch academies at
law schools and areas designated by the Congress as the need arises.
The Committee reported that it had no information at the present
time as to the feasibility of the proposed legislation, the need for
establishing such academies, or the probable cost entailed. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference deferred action
on the bill pending further study by the Committee.
             ApPEALS FROM INDIAN TRIBAL CoURTS

   S. 962, 89th Congress, would authorize an appeal from a judg­
ment of conviction in an Indian Tribal Court where there has been
an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right. The appeal-would
be to a district court and the method of review would be a trial
de novo. The Committee was unable to express an opinion at the
present time as to the impact which the proposed legislation may
have on the internal administration of tribal courts, particularly in
those situations in which exclusive jurisdiction is reserved to the
tribes by treaty. The Conference, thereupon, referred the bill to
                                 75 

the Committee for further study with authorization to seek the
views of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
                     YOUTH CoRRECTIONS      ACT
   The Youth Corrections Division of the Board of Parole has
recorrunended a bill to amend the Federal Youth Corrections Act,
18 U.S.C. 5005 et seq., to place certain restrictions on the applica­
tion of the Act and to circumscribe its use in misdemeanor cases.
In its consideration of the proposals contained in the draft bill, the
Conference also discussed other aspects of problems relating to the
sentencing of youth offenders, including those arising upon the
revocation of probation. After full discussion, the Conference
voted to refer the bill to the Committee for further consideration
in the light of the various suggestions made at the Conference.

             CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964
   Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman of the Committee to
Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, presented an interim
report to the Conference on the activities of the Committee and
the formulation of district and circuit plans under the provisions of
the Act.
   Judge Hastings informed the Conference that numerous inquiries
have arisen from a wide variety of sources setting forth problems
and questions in connection with the implementation of the Act.
With respect to these specific inquiries the Committee has given
its views to the Director of the Administrative Office. With a few
exceptions, however, the Committee has not deemed it advisable
to suggest permanent guidelines to the Conference at this time.
It was felt that there has not been enough experience in the opera­
tion of the Act to warrant a recorrunendation of further rules and
guidelines. The Committee did express its view, however, that a
claim for compensation and reimbursement of expenses in connec­
tion with the preparation of a petition for a writ of certiorari to
the Supreme Court of the United States is properly a part of the
claim to be submitted by appellate counsel for services and expenses
incurred in the court of appeals. With regard to the printing of
briefs and appendices in the court of appeals, the Committee felt
that if a court of appeals, prior to the Criminal Justice Act, had
followed the practice of taking a case on the original record and
                                  76 

typewritten briefs, without incurring the additional expense re­
quired by printing, that it should continue to do so in cases in
which counsel are appointed under the provisions of the Act.
                         ApPROVED FORMS

  The Conference was informed of the results of a trial run under
the Criminal Justice Act conducted at San Diego in the Southern
District of California. This experiment suggests the probable
need for minor changes in certain approved forms now in use. It
was further suggested that individual district courts may wish to
supplement the forms, recommended by the Committee and ap­
proved by the Conference, with local forms designed to serve their
own particular needs.

                         PUBLIC DEFENDERS

   The report of the conference committee in the Congress on the
Criminal Justice Act of 1964 placed upon the Department of
Justice, in cooperation with the Judicial Conference of the United
States and the judicial councils of the circuits, the duty to re­
examine the need for public defenders in the light of the operation
of the Criminal Justice Act and to submit conclusions and recom­
mendations "as expeditiously as proper after adequate facts and
experience offer a sound basis for proper conclusions and recom­
mendations." The Committee reported that it had conferred with
a representative of the Department of Justice and had authorized
the Director of the Administrative Office to designate members of
his staff to meet with represen tatives of the Department to consider
the preparation of a plan leading to such a study and to submit
recommendations to the Committee. The Director was also au­
thorized to exchange information with the Department of Justice
reHecting the results of statistical studies at appropriate intervals.
It was agreed that all reports made to the Congress should be joint
reports, even though there may be a divergence of views on particu­
lar matters set out in a report.
                         REVIEW OF PLANS

  The Conference was informed that all district and circuit plans
have now been filed with the Administrative Office, as required by
the Criminal Justice Act. The Administrative Office has completed
                                 77 

a review of the plans, both from the standpoint of fiscal control and
for conformity with the statute, and has brought certain matters
to the attention of the Committee. It was the view of the Com­
mittee, however, that no specific recommendations should be made
at this time for the modification of any plan until it is determined
by experience whether the operation of particular plans conforms
to the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act.

                          ApPROPRIATIONS

  The Committee recommended that appropriation requests to the
Congress for the fiscal year 1967 include the sum of $7,500,000 for
the operation of the Criminal Justice Act. This is the same amount
requested by the Conference for the fiscaJ year 1966. The Com­
mittee, believing that the need for administrative services is pre­
sent in all circuits, urgently recommended the renewal of the request
for appropriations for administrative services in all circuits.
  The report of the Committee was received and approved by the
Conference.
    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  Chief Judge Thomas M. Madden, on behalf of Judge Luther W.
Youngdahl, Chairman of the Committee on the Administration of
the Probation System, presented the report of the Committee to
the Conference.

          REGIONAL SUPERVISION OF PROBATION OFFICES

   Judge Madden informed the Conference that the pilot project on
the regional supervision of probation offices, as reported to the
Conference in March 1965 (Conf. Rept., p. 34) is now under way.
A profile for office evaluation-an instrument to measure the effec­
tiveness of a probation office-has been developed by the project
director and approved by the Probation Division. It was reported
that the Federal Probation Officers Association, which for a number
of years has endorsed the concept of regional supervision, has ex­
pressed its enthusiasm for the project and its progress to date.
                         YOUTH SERVICES

 The Committee reported that the Director of the Job Corps and
members of his staff have pledged their full cooperation in making
                                 78 

available to youthful probationers and parolees the facilities of the
Job Corps conservation camps. A memorandum setting forth
policies and procedures was distributed in May to the judges of the
district courts and to aU probation officers.
  The Director of the Neighborhood Youth Corps of the Depart­
ment of Labor and members of his staff have also agreed to co­
operate in making available the resources of that agency. The
judges of the district courts and probation officers have been so
informed.
           REoRGANIZATION OF THE PROBATION SERVICE

   Judge Madden informed the Conference that members of the
Committee had conferred with the Attorney General, represent~
atives of the Department of Justice, the Administrative Office,
and various other interested judges on the proposal to establish
a unified federal correctional service. While there appears to be
general agreement on the objectives sought through a unified
service, there is disagreement on the organization of such a service.
A further report will be made at a later session of the Conference.
                     SENTENCING INSTITUTES

   The Conference was informed that the Sentencing Institute
in the Ninth Circuit, previously reported to the Conference (Conf.
Rept., March 1965, p. 33), was held at the United States Peniten­
tiary, McNeil Island, Washington, on September 13 and 14. The
Committee was represented by Judge Francis L. Van Dusen, Chair­
man of the Subcommittee on Sentencing Institutes, which had
approved the format of the program.
   The report of the Committee was received and approved by the
Conference.
                  SUPPORTING PERSONNEL·
   The Chairman of the Committee on Supportiug Personnel, Chief
Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report of the Committee
to the Conference.
                            LIBRARIANS

  The Chief Judges of the Oourt of Claims and the Cour~ of Cus­
toms and Patent Appeals jointly requested authority 'Uf:'bploy
two persons as librarians to staff the joint library in 'the new
                                  79 

building soon to be occupied by both courts. One position would
be a librarian at Grade JSP-ll in the Court of Claims and the other
a position of librarian at Grade JSP-7 in the Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals. Upon recommendation of the Committtee, the
Conference authorized these two new positions under the terms of
the classification for librarians approved by the Conference in
September 1960 (Conf. Rept., p. 13), subject, however. to the
availabilty of funds.
DEPUTY CLERKS FOR THE COURT OF ApPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CmCUIT

   A request was received from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit for five additional permanent positions in the clerk's office
of that court. At present the court has four temporary positions,
three of which will be made permanent upon the enactment of the
current appropriations bill. In view of the pressing situation in
the Fifth Circuit, the Committee recommended that, within the
funds available, every effort be made to continue the fourth tem­
porary position and, in addition, that the court be authorized to
appoint another temporary employee. The Committee also recom­
mended that when funds are available, the two temporary posi­
tions be made permanent. These recommendations were approved
by the Conference.
   Judge Levin informed the Conference that the Committee had
again considered the request of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit for the reclassification of the clerk of that court. A similar
request was considered by the Committee last year (Conf. Rept.,
Sept. 1964, p. 100) and disapproved. Upon recommendation of
the Committee, the Conference directed that no reclassification
be made.
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR CLERKS' OFFICES FOR CoURTS OF ApPEALS
                       AND DISTRICT COURTS

  The Conference was informed that numerous requests have been
received for additional positions for the clerks' offices of the courts
of appeals and district courts, some of which were for additional
positions as a result of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964. Consonant
with the expressed views of the Conference, the Committee con­
cluded that until experience has been gained with practices under
the Criminal Justice Act, no provision should be made for augment­
                                 80 

ing the staffs of clerks' offices on that account. The Committee
was of the view, however, that requests should be made for 32
additional positions in the clerks' offices of the district courts and
9 additional positions in the clerks' offices of the courts of appeals
for the fiscal year 1967. The views of the Committee were approved
by the Conference.
  The Committee also recommended that temporary help continue
to be authorized for clerks' offices within the limits of available
funds.
                            SECRETARIES

  A survey of positions comparable to that of a secretary to a
judge, prepared by the Administrative Office at the direction of the
Committee, was submitted to the Committee for its consideration.
Judge Levin informed the Conference that the report had been
discussed, but that the matter of providing higher grades for
judges' secretaries had been deferred by the Committee pending
further study.
                           LAW CLERKS

  Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
directed that the request of the Chief Judge of the District of North
Dakota for a higher grade and salary for his law clerk, who is
presently in Grade JSP-12, be denied. Requests of a sinrilar nature
had been considered in the past and denied on the grounds that
the present maximum law clerk classification is appropriate.
                        PROBATION OFFICES

   The appropriation estimates for the fiscal year 1966 included
funds for 90 additional probation officer positions and 68 clerk­
stenographer positions in the probation service. However, funds
were provided for only 30 probation officer positions and 23 clerk­
stenographer positions. The Committee recommended that a re­
quest be made to Congress to restore for 1967 the funds for the
60 additional probation officers and 45 additional clerk-stenogra­
pher positions which were cut from the 1966 estimates. This
recommendation was approved by the Conference.
                                 81 

                         COURT REPORTERS

  It was suggested to the Committee that the presen t court reporter
system be changed in order to place court reporters on the same
salary basis as other supporting personnel of the courts. The Com­
mittee, after considering the proposal, concluded that in the absence
of concrete suggestions for improving the current system, there
was no reason to recommend any change in the present court
reporting system. The Conference concurred in the views of the
Committee.
  Upon motion of Chief Judge Chambers, the Conference separated
the combined position of court reporter-law clerk to Chief Judge
William D. Murray of the District of Montana and authorized the
appointment of a court reporter at the salary rate applicable to all
other court reporters.
                           COURT CRIERS

   The Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit renewed its request
for a reclassification of court criers from Grade JSP-5 to Grade
JSP-7. On the basis of a similar request a year ago, the Committee
concluded that the present court crier classification of JSP-5 was
appropriate. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference reaffirmed its approval of the views of the Committee.
                 UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

  On motion of Chief Judge Solomon, the Conference authorized
the Committee on Supporting Personnel to consider a proposal to
amend 28 U.S.C. 633(a) to increase the limitation on fees that may
be earned by a United States commissioner from $10,500 per annum
to $22,500 per annum.
           TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE
  Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Committee on
Trial Practice and Technique, presented the report of the
Committee.
              SEMINAR FOR NEW DISTRICT JUDGES

  Judge Murrah reported that in accordance with the resolution
adopted by the Conference at its session in September 1964 (Conf.
                                 82 

Rept., p. 107) a fifth seminar for newly appointed United States
district judges, conducted under the auspices of the Committee,
was held in Denver, Colorado during the week of June 28. Twenty
newly appointed district judges and three circuit judges, who ex­
pressed an interest in learning more about the day-to-day operation
of a district court, participated in the seminar discussions. The
chief trial commissioner of the Court of Claims was also present
during the first half of the seminar.
   This year's seminar was planned and arranged by a subcommittee
under the chairmanship of Circuit Judge Irving R. Kaufman. The
program followed the basic plan of the four seminars for new district
judges previously held. The format, however, was thoroughly re­
vised, the number of discussion leaders sha,rply reduced, and the
time allotted for formal presentations greatly curtailed. The semi­
nar was acclaimed by the participants and discussion leaders as
being most successful.
  Altogether 131 newly appointed United States district judges
have attended one of the five seminars conducted under the auspices
of the Committee. In accordance with the prior authorization
of the Conference, the Committee will formulate plans, and an­
nounce at an early date, the time and place for the next seminar
for newly appointed district judges.
        HANDBOOK FOR EFFECTIVE PRETRIAL PROCEDURE

   The Committee reported that the Handbook for Effective Pre­
trial Procedure, approved by the Conference at its session in Sep­
tember 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 104) was published in the July 1965
issue of Federal Rules Decisions, 37 F.R.D. 257. Reprints of the
Handbook were supplied through the courtesy of the West Publish­
ing Company and a copy has been distributed to every circuit and
district judge.
                      CIRCUIT COMMITTEES

   Judge Murrah called attention to the resolution adopted by the
Conference in September 1952 (Conf. Rept., p. 21) and renewed
in September 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 77), recommending the appoint­
ment of a pretrial committee in each circuit. The Committee re­
quested the chief judge of each circuit to review these resolutions
                                  83 

of the Conference and consider the reactivation of any circuit
committee which may not be functioning.

            SUBCOMMITTEE ON MULTIPLE LITIGATION

   The subcommmittee of the Committee on Trial Practice and
Technique, appointed to consider discovery problems arising in
multiple litigation with common witnesses and exhibits has, during
the past year, continued its work of coordinating the 1,912 private
antitrust suits arising out of the criminal antitrust proceedings in
the electrical equipment industry in Philadelphia in 1961. A report
by the subcommittee detailing the significant progress made to­
wards the disposition of this litigation was presented to the Con­
ference with the recommendation that the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office be authorized to circulate a copy, as a matter of
information, to every United States judge.
  The report of the Committee was received and approved by the
Conference.
                        HABEAS CORPUS
   Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
Habeas Corpus, reported that in accordance with the direction of
the Conference at its March 1965 session (Conf. Rept., p. 23) the
Committee had considered further the provisions of the bill, here­
tofore recommended by the Conference, relating to the empanel­
ment of three-judge district courts to consider certain habeas corpus
applications by state prisoners. These proposals are now embodied
in H.R. 4977, 89th Congress, which is presently pending before the
Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives.
   The Committee reported that various tables showing the number
of applications filed by state prisoners in the United States district
courts and the disposition thereof for the fiscal years 1941 to 1957,
inclusive, and for the fiscal years 1963 and 1964 had been furnished
by the Administrative Office. These tables show that if the pro­
visions of H.R. 4977 had been in force in 1957, the number of hear­
ings by three-judge district courts on habeas corpus applications
by state prisoners would have averaged less than three per circuit.
In the fiscal year 1956 the average would have been only two per
circuit and in 1954 and 1955, less than three per circuit. The Com­
mittee in its report to the Conference in March 1959 estimated
                                 84 

that the number of three-judge district courts that would have been
constituted, had the proposed legislation been enacted and in force
in the fiscal year 1958 would not have exceeded, in that year, an
average of four per circuit.
   The statistical information supplied by the Administrative
Office, however, shows that significant changes have taken place
since 1957. If the proposed legislation had been in effect during
the fiscal year 1963, the number of three-judge district court cases,
according to the statistics, would have averaged eleven per circuit,
and in the fiscal year 1964 the number would have risen to more
than 26 per circuit. The Committee also noted that only a small
percentage of state prisoners filing habeas corpus applications in
the U ni ted States district courts are successful.
   In view of the large number of three-judge district courts that
would now be required to hear habeas corpus applications by state
prisoners, the disruption of the normal work of the two additional
judges and inconveniences they would suffer when designated to sit
on a three-judge district court, and, the comparatively few appli­
cations by state prisoners that are now decided in favor of the
prisoner, the Committee concluded that the provisions with respect
to three-judge district courts incorporated in H.R. 4977, 89th Con­
gress, can no longer be justified. The Committee, accordingly,
recommended to the Conference that it request the respective Com­
mittees on the judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives
to accord it the privilege of withdrawing its previous recommen­
dation and that there be substituted for H.R. 4977, 89th Congress,
a revised bill, submitted by the Committee, which eliminates all
provisions with respect to three-judge district courts. This recom­
mendation was approved by the Conference.

   PRETERMISSION OF THE TERMS OF COURTS OF
                   APPEALS

   At the request of Chief Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., the
Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented to the pretermis­
sion of the term of court of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit scheduled to be held at Asheville, North Carolina in
June 1966.
                                 85
            RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
