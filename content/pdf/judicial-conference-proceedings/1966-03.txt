    fiscal year 1967 had been held before the subcommittee of the Com·
    mittee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, but
    thatno report by the Appropriations Committee had as yet been
    issued. The requests this year include funds totalling $7,040,000
    to cover the cost of payments to be made under the Criminal Jus·
    tice Act of 1964, which is the same as the amount requested last
    year. The Committee in its presentation also stressed the need
    for coordinators to be appointed in each circuit to aid in adminis­
    tering the Criminal Justice Act, with particular emphasis on the
    District of Columbia Circuit. The requests also include funds for
    additional supporting personnel, additional probation officers,
    additional assistance in the Administrative Office, and additional
    clerical assistance for referees in bankruptcy.
       The Committee reported that hearings have also been held on
    a supplemental appropriation request for the fiscal year 1966 for
    additional funds to take care of a recent increase in jurors' fees
    and for additional funds for salaries of judges. The Committee
    is hopeful that these requests for supplemental appropriations will
    be granted.

(     Senior Judge John Biggs, Jr., on behalf of Senior Judge Harvey
    M. Johnsen, Chairman of the Committee on Judicial Statistics,
    presented the report of the Committee.
                        ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

      Judge Biggs informed the Conference that requests have come
    to the Committee for recommendations for additional judgeships
    beyond those which the Conference has heretofore approved. The
    Committee was of the view, however, that in accordance with
    previously expressed policy (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1965, p.47) these
    requests should be passed over until the time of the Committee's
    next overall consideration and evaluation and that no additional
    recommendation should be made at this time for additional judge­
    ships in modification of the pending omnibus judgeship bilL
    Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the Committee on
    Court Administration concurred in the views of the Committee on
    Judicial Statistics.
                           CoURTS OF ApPEALS
      The Conference at its September 1965 session (Conf. Rept.,
    p.47) authorized the Committees on Judicial Statistics and Court
        213-275-66--2
                                 4


Administration to undertake a comprehensive study of the work­
load of the United States courts of appeals in light of the addi­
tional district judgeship positions created in 1961 and the pro­
posals for additional district judgeships presently recommended,
and, on the basis of its study and evaluation, to recommend to the
Conference any additional appellate judgeships which are
required.
   The Conference was informed that the Committees had begun
such a study and evaluation, but that there had not been time
to perform the task in a manner to afford basis for thorough con­
sideration and report to the Conference. The Committees there­
upon, were authorized to continue their study and report at a later
session of the Conference.

                 COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration,
Senior Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the report of the
Committee.
                  SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES

   The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representa- (
tives had requested the views of the Conference on H.R. 7810,
89th Congress, to amend the Judicial Code to require chief judges
of circuits and of multiple-judge district courts to relinquish their
duties as chief judges at age 66. The provisions of the bill would
not become effective, however, until 5 years after the date of its
enactment. H.R. 7641 and H.R. 8712, 89th Congress, are identical
bills.
   Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the proposals con­
tained in these bills were considered jointly by the Committees on
Court Administration and Revision of the Laws and that there was
a division of opinion among the judges of the two Committees
as to the merits of the proposal and as to the desirability of a delay   I
                                                                         ~ 

of 5 years in its effective date. After full discussion the Confer­
ence voted to recommend that no change be made in the present 

statutory age limit of 70 years for chief judges of circuits and 

district courts. 

              JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY SYSTEM

 Judge Biggs reported that the Committee had considered the ( )
Third Actuarial Valuation of the Judicial Survivors Annuity Sys­
                                      5


    tem as of December 31, 1964 prepared by the actuarial staff of the
    Social Security Administration in accordance with the statute, 28       ~
    U.S.C. 376. According to this report the Judicial Survivors An­
    nuity Fund will be completely exhausted by the year 1984. To
    secure additional financing it was suggested to the Committee that
    agency contributions to the fund be increased to maintain the sol­
    vency of the Fund. The Committee intends to discuss this sugges­
    tion with the Chairman of the Judicial Conference Budget Com­
    mittee and with the Civil Service Commission in order to ascertain
    the possibilities of an increase in the agency contributions in the
    near future. A further report and recommendation as to what
    course the Committee believes should be pursued will be made at a
    later session of the Conference.
                        PLACES OF HOLDING CoURT

       H.R. 11825, 89th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 97(b) to add
    Hopkinsville as an additional place of holding court in the West­
    ern District of Kentucky. The Conference was informed that the
    Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit was of the view that the addi­
    tional place of holding court was not needed. Upon recommenda­
(   tion of the Committee, the Conference disapproved the bill.
       The Conference was informed that the Judicial Council of the
    Fifth Circuit had recommended the establishment of an additional
    division in the Western District of Texas in the Midland-Odessa
    area with an additional place of holding court at Odessa. Upon
    motion of Chief Judge Tuttle, the proposal was approved by the
    Conference.
                      ELECTRONIC SOUND RECORDING

       Public Law 89-163, 79 Stat. 619, permits the use of electronic
    sound recording equIpment in the United States district courts in
    augmentation of recording by shorthand or by mechanical means
    (see Conf. Rept., Sept. 1965, p. 58). The use of this recording
    equipment, however, is subject to regulations promulgated by the
    Judicial Conference. Judge Biggs informed the Conference that
    the Director of the Administrative Office had submitted to the
    Committee proposed regulations, pursuant to the Act, governing
    the use of electronic sound recording equipment in the district
    courts, together with a proposed memorandum to court reporters
    and forms of two certificates, one of which is to accompany the
(   recording to be filed with the clerk of court and the other, a certi­
                                 6

fication of sound recordings made, is to be filed quarterly with the·
Director of the Administrative Office. The Committee reported
that it had examined the proposed memorandum, regulations and
certificates and had found them to be well adapted for the purposes
for which they were intended. Upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee, the proposed regulations were adopted by the Conference.

                     RETIREMENT OF JUDGES

   The Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate
had previously requested the views of the Conference on S. 1368,
88th Congress, to provide for the appointment of an a~ditiona1
judge for any of the United States courts of appeals, district courts,
Court of Claims, Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, or Cus­
toms Court, upon the attainment of age 70 by any judge thereafter
appointed to such court. The bill would authorize the President
upon recommendation of the Judicial Council of the Circuit, or
appropriate judicial officer in the case of judges of other courts, to
appoint an additional judge, by and with the consent of the Senate,
when a judge eligible to retire fails to do so. The bill, however,
makes no provision for loss of seniority, nor does it contain any
requirement of a finding by the Judicial Council of the need for (
an additional judgeship in the court. Upon recommendation of
the- Committee, the Conference voted to disapprove the bill.

                       JUDICIAL DISABILITY

   Judge Biggs submitted to the Conference drafts of two bills,
developed by the Committee, to create a Commission on Judicial
Disability and for other purposes.
   The Conference considered both proposals and, after full dis­
cussion, instructed the Director of the Administrative Office to
circulate to all members of the federal judiciary for their informa-     °
tion that portion of the report of the Committee on Court Admin­
istration relating to the proposed Commission on Judicial Dis- _         1
ability. The Conference also recommended that the proposals of
the Committee be discussed at the Judicial Conferences of the
Circuits to be held thi.s year.
  The Committee was authorized to continue its study and to
cooperate fully with the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and
House of Representatives with respect to legislation concerning
the tenure and retirement of judges.                            (
                                       7
        In view of the further consideration to be given to the pro­
     posals for a Commission on Judicial Disability, the Conference,
     upon recommendation of the Committee, voted to disapprove the
     following bills, pending in the 89th Congress, which relate to the
     disability of judges:
        (1) H.R. 10117, 89th Congress, to amend Title 28, United
     States Code, to provide that whenever any judge is unable to dis­
     charge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of permanent
     mental or physical disability and a majority of the members of
     the Judicial Council of his circuit, in the case of a circuit or dis­
     trict judge, certifies that the appointment of an additional judge
     is necessary for the efficient dispatch of business, the President
     may make such appointment, by and with the advice and consent
     of the Senate; and
        (2) S. 2299, 89th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 372, to provide
     for the mandatory retirement of district judges of the United
     States for permanent physical or mental disability.
                         GEOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION

       Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the proposal to con­
(	   solidate the two judicial districts in the State of South Carolina,
     recommended by the Subcommittee on Geographic Organization
     and approved by the Conference, had been enacted into law.
     Public Law 89-242, 79 Stat. 951, approved October 7, 1965.
                       REVISION OF THE LAWS
       Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on
     Revision of the Laws, submitted the report of the Committee.
                 COURT OF LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS

        S. 2891, 89th Congress, would provide for the establishment of a
     United States Court of Labor-Management Relations. The court
     would be comprised of a chief judge and four associate judges, ap­
     pointed to hold office during good behavior, and would have ex­
     clusive jurisdiction over labor disputes affecting commerce that
     result in, or threaten to result in, a strike, lockout or other con­
     certed work stoppage which would adversely affect the public
     interest of the Nation to a substantial degree. It was the view of
(    both the Committee on Court Administration and Revision of the
                                 8

Laws that the problem to which the bill is directed is a serious
one and that the bill should be given careful study by the Confer­
ence before a recommendation is made. Accordingly, the Commit­
tees recommended that they be authorized to undertake such a
study through a subcommittee, which in addition to members of
the two Committees, would include persons specially qualified in
the field of labor relations. The Conference approved the study by
a subcommittee, to be comprised only of members of the Federal
judiciary, and directed that the Senate Judiciary Committee, which
had requested the views of the Conference, be informed that the
Conference desires to defer the expression of its views on S. 2891
pending completion of the study.
               REVISION OF THE COPYRIGHT LAWS

   H.R. 4347, H.R. 5680, H.R. 6831 and H.R. 6835, 89th Congress,
would codify and revise Title 17, United States Code, relating to
copyrights. The Committee reported that these bills do not pro­
pose any drastic changes in the existing judicial remedies for copy­
right infringement. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference voted to approve the provisions of Chapter 5 of these
bills relating to judicial remedies.                                 (
        CODIFICATION OF TITLE     5,   UNITED STATES CoDE

   H.R. 10104, 89th Congress, would revise, codify and enact into
law, Title 5, United States Code, entitled "Government Organiza­
tion and Employees" (Conf. Rept., March 1953, p. 14, and Sept.
1963, p. 17). The Committee had previously called to the atten­
tion of the staff of the House Judiciary Committee certain provi­
sions of an earlier bill, H.R. 4158, 88th Congress, which would in­
advertently change the present law and adversely ,affect judicial
and Administrative Office personnel. The Committee found, how­
ever, that a number of the amendments proposed to H.R. 4158 were
not included in the revised bill H.R. 10104, which passed the House
of Representatives on September 7,1965. The Committee accord­
ingly submitted a memorandum of amendments which it believes
to be still needed in the bill, together with explanatory notes, and
recommended that the Senate Judiciary Committee be requested
to incorporate these amendments in H.R. 10104. This recom­
mendation was approved by the Conference.

                        REGISTRATION OF JUDGMENTS

        Judge Maris informed the Conference that the Depa~tment of
     Justice had requested the views of the Conference on a proposal
     to amend 28 U.S.C. 1963 to provide that a judgment of a United
     States district court for money or property may be registered in
     any other district immediately after it is entered instead of at the
     time it is to become final by appeal or expiration of time for ap­
     peal. While the Committee believes there is merit in the proposed
     amendment, it was of the view that there may be problems of due
     process involved which require more study and consideration. The
     Committee accordingly recommended that the Conference indicate
     that it is cognizant of the problem presented by the Department
     of Justice and agrees that it should be solved by appropriate legis­
     lation, but that since there are other problems which should be
     taken into consideration in framing any legislation on the sub­
     ject, the Conference desires to defer any definitive expression of
     views until specific legislation is proposed. This recommendation
     was approved by the Conference.
        The Department of Justice also called attention to the wide
     diversity in practice among the district courts in connection with
     the documents that are required for the registration of a judgment
     under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1963. Upon recommendation of
     the Committee, the Conference authorized the Administrative Of­
     fice to formulate and provide the clerks of the district courts with
     a uniform form of certification to be made by the clerk of the
     originating district, so that the clerks of the districts in which
     judgments are sought to be registered may act uniformly in com­
     pliance with 28 U.S.C. 1963.

                                 LEGISLATION

        The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, reaf­
     firmed its approval of the following bills pending in the 89th Con­
     gress which embody proposals heretofore approved:
        (1) H.R. 11875, 89th Congress, to amend the Tucker Act to
     increase from $10,000 to $50,000 the limitation on the jurisdic­
     tion of the United States district courts in suits against the United
     States for breach of contract or .for compensation. (Conf. Rept.,
     Sept. 1965, p. 61, and Sept. 1964, p. 64.)

\.
                                 10 

   (2) H.R. 12232, 89th Congress, to make admissible in evidence
without further authentication, the slip laws published by the
General Services Administration and the Treaties and other Inter­
national Act series, issued by the Secretary of State. (Conf.
Rept., Sept. 1965, p. 61.)
   The Conference, ,upon recommendation of the Committee, re­
affirmed its disapproval of the proposal contained in H.R. 11876,
89th Congress,to waive the statute of limitations on certain claims
of any officer who is a member of a Reserve component of the uni­
form services of the United States. Similar bills were previously
disapproved by the Conference. (Conf. Rept.,March 1965, p. 16,
and Sept. 1965, p. 63.)
                  COURT OF VETERANS ApPEALS

  H.R. 11551, 89th Congress, would amend Title 38, United States
Code, to establish a Court of Veterans' Appeals and prescribe its
jurisdiction and functions. The bill is identical to H.R. 211, 89th
Congress, approved by the Conference at its March 1965 session
(Conf. Rept., p. 18) but only as to the type of review which would
be provided by a special Court of Veterans' Appeals with local
hearings by commissioners of the court. The Conference, however,
refrained from expressing any view as to the policy of granting ap­
peals in veterans' cases. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference reaffirmed the views previously expressed.
        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
  Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing Com­
mittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, reported that the pro­
posals for amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in­
cluding the unification of civil and admiralty procedure, and the
proposals for the amendment of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, approved by the Conference at its September 1965
session (Conf. Rept., p. 52) were adopted by the Supreme Court
without change on February 28, 1966. The amendments there­
after were transmitted by the Chief Justice to the Senate and the
House of Representatives and, in the absence of contrary action by
the Congress, will go into effect on July 1, 1966, purusant to the
order of the Supreme Court.
  The Conference was informed that the Advisory Committee on
Civil Rules is continuing its study of the rules relating to deposi­
                                  11 


tions and discovery. Appropriate amendments to these rules will
be formulated and published for the consideration of the bench
and bar in the near future. The Advisory Committee on the Fed­
eral Rules of Criminal Procedure is also continuing its study of a
few remaining proposals for rules changes.
   The Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules is now engaged in
perfecting its final draft of uniform rules of appellate procedure,
although the bill to empower the Supreme Court to promulgate
uniform appellate rules is still pending in the Congress. Both the
Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules and the Advisory Com­
mittee on Rules of Evidence are presently engaged in the large
tasks of preparing complete sets of uniform rules. Completion of
the task of drafting bankruptcy rules and rules of evidence is not
anticipated for some time. The Advisory Committee on Admi­
ralty Rules was reported as being presently inactive following the
completion of its work of preparing rules for the unification of
civil and admiralty procedure.

        INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
   The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Intercircuit As­
signments, Circuit Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported on the
processing of requests for intercircuit assign meats for the period
July 30, 1965, through February 18, 1966. During this period
the Committee recommended favorably on 34 assignments to be
undertaken by 24 judges, 8 of whom have each accepted more than
one assignment. All assignments recommended by the Committee
were approved by the Chief Justice except one where the certificate
of need was withdrawn before the Committee's recommendation
was acted upon. One other assigned judge was unable to fulfill
his assignment. The judges receiving assignments include five
circuit judges, three senior circuit judges, eight district judges, six
senior district judges, and two senior judges of the Court of Claims.
   Of the assignments which have been, or will be, undertaken, 13
were for service in the courts of appeals. Of these, three were for
service in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, eight were for
service in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and one each
for service in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
   The Committee reported that it is continuing its policy of en­
couraging service by senior judges in those courts which need help.
     213-275-66~-3
                                 12
During the period of this report, 11 senior judges have accepted
assignmen ts.
   The Committee reported that the revised fonus for intercircuit
assignments, recommended in its last report, have now been put
in use and appear to be well accepted. The report of the Commit­
tee, including a statement relating to the need for intercircuit as­
signments and the availability of judges for such service, was
received by the Conference.

             CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964
   Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman of the Committee to
Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, presented the report
of the Committee.                                                           ~l
                                                                            ~,



                ApPOINTMENTS UNDER THE ACT

   The Conference was informed that the Director of the Adminis­
                                                                            I
trative Office had presented to the Committee a report on the ap­
pointments of attorneys and the payment of claims made pursuant
to the Criminal Justice Act from the period August 20, 1965 to              i
January 31, 1966. The report shows that attorneys are now being
appointed at the rate of 1,500 per month, or 18,000 per year, com­
pared with an early estimate of 20,000 appointments annually.
Of the total appointments made, 29 percent were by United States
commissioners, 68 percent by judges of the district courts and 3
percent by the courts of appeals. The Committee pointed out that
the statistical data contained in the report reflect only the experi­
ence in the beginning of the operation under the Criminal Justice
Act and that definitive conclusions as to ultimate results cannot be
forecast at this time.
                          ApPROPRIATIONS

   Appropriations in the amount of $7,040,000 for the operation
of the Criminal Justice Act have again been requested for the fis­
cal year 1967, which is the same amount requested for the fiscal
                                                                        1
                                                                        j




year 1966. The Committee pointed out that financial experience
under the Act has not been sufficient to warrant a request for ap­
propriations in excess of what was requested last year.. If the
amount proves insufficient, the Congress will be requested to con­
sider any needed deficiency in the appropriations. The Committee
also reported that a request has again been made for funds to
                                      13 


provide for administrative services for each of the 11 circuits, and
that the peculiar needs of the District of Columbia Circuit have
been emphasized.

                      REVOCATION OF PROBATION

   The Conference was informed that the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office had been authorized to submit to the Comptroller
General the question or" whether counsel can be appointed under
the Criminal Justice Act to represent a defendant in proceedings
on revocation of probation. The payment of vouchers for such
services had been withheld by the Administrative Office pending
action by the Committee.
                              TRAVEL COSTS

   Judge Hastings informed the Conference that the Committee
had given consideration to payments under the Criminal Justice
Act for the travel time of attorneys and had concluded that if
there were appropriate circumstances under which compensation
for time spent in travel should be allowed, it could only be at the
rate for time spent for services rendered out of court, not exceeding
$10 per hour. The Committee felt that under no circumstances
could a rate up to $15 per hour be justified.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
adopted the following statement of policy to serve as a guideline
to the courts in determining the appropriateness of payments to
attorneys for "time spent in travel to and from court, which is to
become effective as to travel performed on and after March 11,
1966:
      When the travel time of an attorney from his office to and from court is
   1 hour or more, the court in its discretion, after taking into consideration
   all the surrounding circumstances, may all()w compensation for time spent
   in such travel at a rate not exceeding $10 per hour j provided, that such
   travel is s()lely in the performance of duties in representing a defendant
   pursuant to an appointment under the Criminal Justice Act of 1004.
  Judge Hastings informed the Conference that it was the view of
                                                       in
the Committee that time spent by an attorney interviewing Wit­
nesses and interviewing his client, who may be confined in jail, is
compensable under the Criminal Justice Act at a rate not to exceed
$10 per hour, but that time spent in court by an attorney waiting·
to receive an assignment under the Criminal Justice Act is not
coU!pensable under the Act.
                                 14 


                  ADMINISTRATION OF THE       ACT
    Several questions pertaining to the adlllinistration of the Crimi'­
 nal Justice Act had been brought to the attention of the Committee
by the Administrative Office. Judge Hastings reported that the
 Committee has expressed its views on these matters as follows:
    (1) Juveniles. That a proceeding under the Juvenile Delin­
quency Act is a criminal proceeding within the purview of the
Criminal Justice Act. If the act with which the juvenile is charged,
if committed by an adult would be considered a felony, then it
 should be considered a felony for the purposes of the Criminal
Justice Act; otherwise, it should be treated as a misdemeanor.
    (2) Capital cases. That in capital cases two attorneys may be
 appointed under the Criminal Justice Act. If this is done, each
attorney would be entitled to claim compensation not to exceed
$500 without the necessity of approval by the chief judge of the
circuit, even though the aggregate of the two claims may exceed
$500.
    (3) District of Columbia Court of General Sessions. It was re­
ported that the Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Circuit has
been of the view that a judge of the Court of General Sessions, sit­
ting as a committing magistrate in federal cases, may appoint an
attorney under the Criminal Justice Act to represent a defendant
iI) a preliminary hearing in a case which subsequently may be tried
in the district court. While the Committee has been of the op­
posite view, it has authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to submit this question to the Comptroller General with all
available material.
    (4) Multiple defendants. That in cases involving mUltiple de­
fendants one attorney may be appointed under the Criminal Jus­
tice Act to represent two or more of the defendants being charged.
However, separate orders of appointment of such attorney should
be executed, since there must be a separate finding of financial
inability to pay as to each defendant. A single voucher may be
submitted by the attorney covering services performed for all de­
fendants; however, if separate vouchers are filed by the attorney
as to each defendant, the charges should be prorated among the .
several defendants so represented.
                RELEASE OF CoMMITl'EE REPORT

  Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference au­
thorized the immediate release of the Committee's report and re­
                                    15 

 quested the Director of the Administrative Office to distribute
 copies to all members of the Federal judiciary for their information.
    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
   Judge Luther W. Youngdahl, Chairman of the Committee on
 the Administration of the Probation System, presented the report
 of the Committee to the Conference.
           PROPOSAL FOR A UNIFIED CORRECTIONAL SERVICE

     The Committee presented to the Conference a comprehensive
  report compiled by Judge William B. Herlands, with respect to
. a proposal for a unified federal correctional service which would
  include the Probation Service and which would be organized as a
  part of the Department of Justice. The Conference instructed the
  Director of the Administrative Office to distribute copies of the Her­
  lands report to all federal judges for their information as to the work
  and views of the Probation Committee.
    The Conference voted to record its opposition to placing the
  Probation Service under the jurisdiction and control of the Depart­
  ment of Justice.
    The Conference authorized the Chief Justice to refer to an appro­
  priate committee or committees of the Conference for study and
  report the advisability and feasibility of establishing a unified
  federal correctional system that would not involve placing the
  Probation Service under the jurisdiction and control of the prose­
  cuting arm of the Government.
              STUDY OF STATE AND FEDERAL SYSTEMS

    The Committee reported that it had received a tentative pro­
 posal from the Dean of the School of Criminology of the Univer­
'sity of California, Dr. Joseph D. Lohman, for a study of the pro­
 bation system and administration generally in the several States
 and in the Federal Government. Th~ Committee is making fur­
 ther inquiry concerning the proposed study and will report at, a
 later session of the Conference.
                     TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION

    It had been suggested to the Committee that upon the transfer
 of jurisdiction of a probationer from one district to another that
 the transferring court expressly authorize the court to which trans­
 fer is made tD alter the period of probation without further in­
                                      16 


quiry of the sentencing court. Existing law, 18 U.S.C. 3653, grants
plenary power to the transferee district with respect to the pro­
bationer, except that the period of probation may not be changed
without the consent of the sentencing court. Upon recommenda­
tion of the Committee, the Conference authorized the addition of
the following language to Probation Form 22 authorizing the trans­
fer of jurisdiction of a probationer together with a footnote to the
form indicating that the provision may be deleted by the trans­
ferring court:
      The Oourt hereby expressly consents that the period of probation may be
    changed by the district court to which this transfer is made without further
    inquiry of this court.

                        SENTENCING INSTITUTES

   On motion of Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, the Conference,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 334, authorizing the convening of an Insti­
tute on Sentencing for the judges of the Eighth and Tenth Circuits
to be held in Denver, Colo., July 11-13, 1966 in accordance with the
plan and program outlined by Judge Murrah.
  The Conference was advised that plans were underway for an
Institute on Sentencing for the judges of the Second Circuit to be
held in the, fall of 1966, and that Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman,
a member of tIle Probation Committee, was exploring the possi­
bility of a joint Sentencing Institute for the judges in the Fourth
and Fifth Circuits during the fiscal year 1967.
                    SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
  The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Personnel, Chief
Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report of the Committee to
the Conference.
                            COURT REPORTERS

  At the request of Chief Judge Levin the Conference authorized
the Committee to reexamine the transcript rates for court reporters
established by the Conference at its March 1958 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 3). The Administrative Office will undertake a survey
of the transcript rates permitted to be charged by reporters in
state courts for the use of the Committee and a report will be made
to the Conference at a future session.
  At the suggestion of Judge Levin, the Conference authorized the
appointment of a court reporter for each of the new district judges
                                   17 


 to be appointed under the judgeship bill which has passed the
 Congress and is awaiting the signature of the President. The sal­
 ary is to be at the rate applicable to other court reporters.
                             LAW CLERKS

    The Conference was informed that difficulties were being en­
 countered by some judges in the selection of law clerks due to their
 eligibility for military duty and in some instances because of the
 drafting of law clerks for military duty before they had completed
 their terms of service as law clerks. The Conference took note
 of these problems and also of the needs of the Nation for qualified
 young men to serve in the military service. After full discussion
 the Conference instructed the Committee to refrain from taking
 any steps to obtain draft deferments for law clerks.
                      MESSENGER-LAW CLERKS

     Judge Levin reported that the Committee had under considera­
  tion a proposal for legislation to permit circuit judges to employ
  messenger-law clerks, in the same manner as the position of crier­
  law clerks has been authorized by legislation for district judges.
  In view of the present request for 33 additional law clerks for the
  courts of appeals, the Committee has deferred further considera­
. tion of this proposal.
                             SECRETARIES

    The Committee reported that it had given full consideration to
 the proposal to permit 4igher grades for secretaries to judges and
 had concluded that it should make no recommendation at this time
 for increasing the salaries of secretaries. The Committee did rec­
 ommend, however, that the Conference reaffirm its approval of
 legislation to bring the retirement benefits of judges' secretaries to
 the same level as those of secretaries to Members of Congress
  (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1962, p. 73). This recommendation was ap­
 proved by the Conference.
                           DEPUTY CLERKS

    Judge Levin reported that the Committee had discussed several
 problems that have arisen in connection with grades of courtroom
 deputy clerks and had concluded that a restudy of the classifica­
 tions of courtroom deputy clerks should be made. The Conference




                                                                             I
                                                                          .. J
                                  18 


thereupon authorized the Committee to restudy the classifications
assigned to the positions of courtroom clerks under the Judiciary
Salary Plan, and, if deemed necessary, to report the results of that
study tathe Conference at a fu ture meeting.
                           TRAINING      ACT
   S. 2345, 89th Congress, would amend the Government Em­
ployees' Training Act so as to extend its benefits to officers and em­
ployees of the Senate and House of Representatives. It was the
view of the Committee that if training programs and benefits are
to be made available to legislative employees, similar programs
and benefits should be extended to the supporting personnel of the
courts. The Conference, thereupon, approved the recommenda­
tion of the Committee that supporting personnel of the courts be
included in the proposed amendment to the Training Act, or, alter­
natively, that separate legislation be introduced for that purpose.
                       PROBATION OFFICERS

   The Federal Probation Officers Association had recommended
that higher grades be authorized for probation officers in "one­
man" districts. It was the view of Committee, however, that the
                                                                         (
Judiciary Salary Plan at the time of its establishment had made
adequate provision for classifying and compensating probation
officers in "one-man" districts and that no change should be made
in the existing arrangement. The Conference voted to concur in
this view.
                           INTERPRETERS

  At the request of Judge Levin the Committee was authorized to
consider further the need for an interpreter in the United States
District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.
             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
  Senior Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., Chairman of the Committee
on Bankruptcy Administration, reported that the Committee had
met and considered the recommendations contained in the survey
report of the Director of the Administrative Office; dated January
21, 1966, relating to the continuance of referee positions tobecome
vacant by expiration of term, for two new referee positions and
for changes in salaries and arrangements for referees. The Com-          C
                                             19
    mittee also considered the recommendations of the district judges
    and of the judicial councils of the circuits concerned.
      The Conference considered the Committee's report and the rec­
    ommendations of the Director, the judicial councils of the circuits
    and the district judges. On the basis of the report and recom­
    mendations, the Conference took the following action relating to
    new referee positions, changes in salaries and arrangements for
    existing referee positions and the filling of referee positions to be­
    come vacant by expiration of term, and directed that, unless other­
    wise noted, the changes become effective April 1, 1966:

                                 ApPROPRIATIONS

   The Conference was informed that appropriation estimktes for
the operation of the Bankruptcy System during the fiscal year
1967 in the amount of $11,263,000 had been submitted to the Con­
gress. The appropriation estimates; if approved, will provide
funds for the salaries of all referee positions duly authorized, and                     (
                                  21 

 funds for 40 additional clerical positions and other services for
 referees' offices. Hearings on these estimates were held before a
 subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee on Feb­
 ruary 7, 1966. However, it will be necessary to obtain an increase
 in the appropriations for the salaries of referees in the amount of
_$74,000 for the add.itional referee positions and changes in the sal­
 aries for referees above approved.
   The Committee reported that receipts into the Referrees Salary
 and Expense Fund during the fiscal years 1966 and 1967 are ex­
 pected to equal or exceed the obligations for these two fiscal years
 and leave a balance of approximately $11,000,000.

                   AMENDMENT OF CHAPTER         XI
   H.R. 293, 89th Congress, would amend Sections 337 and 338 of
the Bankruproy Act (11 U.S.C. 737 and 738), and add a new Sec­
tion 339 to make clarifying changes with respect to the functions
of creditors' committees and the expenses incurred by these com­
mittees in the administration of proceedings brought under Chap­
ter XI of the Bankruproy Act. The proposed new Section 339
would permit payment to unofficial creditors' committees of ex­
penses incurred by attorneys' accountants and agents, retained by
them prior to the filing of the petition under Chapter XI in the
preparation of a plan that might be acceptable to the creditors,
debtor and the court. The Committee reported that the bill, spon­
sored by the National Bankruptcy Conference, is intended to over­
come the decision in Lanev. Haytian Corp. of Am. (2nd Cir.1941),
117 F. 2d 216, holding that the payment of these expenses could
not be included in a plan under Chapter XI. Upon recommenda­
tion of the Committee, the Conference voted to approve the bill.

                        OTHER LEGISLATION

   Judge Hamlin informed the Conference that the following bills,
pending in the 89th Congress, had been referred to a subcommittee
of the Committee on Bankruptcy Administration for study and
report to the Committee at its next meeting:
   (1) H.R. 11769, 89th Congress, to amend Sections 1(19),5, 32a,
Ma(l) and 67d(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 1(19), 23(a),
55 (a), 104(a)( 1), and 107(d)(4) relating to partnerships, and
   (2) H.R. 11965, 89th Congress, all omnibus Chapter XIII bill,
                                              22 

        which would make numerous changes in the provisions of the
        Bankruptcy Act relating to wage earner proceedings under Chapter
        XIII.

                              FEES AND SPECIAL CHARGES

           It had been brought to the attention of the Committee that
        the rules for the determination of "Net Proceeds Realized" in com­
        puting payments to be made under Section 4Oc(2) of the Bank­
        ruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 68(c)(2), have been subject to varying
        interpretations. The result has been a la~k of uniformity in the
        application of the schedule of fees and charges for the Referees' Sal­
        ary and Expense Fund previously approved by the Conference.
        Some bankruptcy courts have been of the view that the entire
        proceeds of sales free and clear of liens were to be included in com­
        puting charges for the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund and
        commissions of trustees. Other courts have used only the net pro­
        ceeds over and above liens and mortgages in computing these
        charges. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
        ence amended Section No. 1 of the rules for determining net pro­
        ceeds realized in asset cases, promulgated by the Conference at the
        April 1947 session (Con£. Rept., p. 40), pursuant to Section 40c(2)                 (
        of the Bankruptcy Act, to read as follows:
             1. Determination of Net Proceeds Realized in Asset Oases. In deter­
           mining the amount of net proceeds realized in asset cases for the purpose
           of Section 4Oc(2) of the Bankruptcy Act as amended, the term "net pro­
           ceeds realized in asset cases" shall mean, in the case of sale or liquidation,
           the amount of money coming into the estate of a bankrupt as assets of such
           estate which shall iMlude the entire sale price of eMumbered property WMn
           sold free and clear of aU Liens or, if not sold or liquidated, the fair cash
           market value of all property coming into the estate as assets of such estate,
           exclusive of all statutory exemptions whether State or Federal and exclu­
           sive of all expenses directly incurred in the operation of the debtor's busi­
           ness after bankruptcy; provided, however, that where property is sold or
           transferred subject to a valid existing mortgage, lien or other encumbrance,
           the amount of such mortgage, lien or other encumbrance not affected by such
           sale shall not be included in determining the amount of net proceeds
           realized.
           The Committee, however, further expressed the view that it is
        inequitable to require unsecured creditors to bear the full cost of
        administration in sales free and cleat of liens and felt that consid­
        eration should be given to legislation to permit their equitable
        allocation. Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Division of the Adminis-




I   '
                                       23 

    trative Office has been instruated to study the matter and rep.Ort to
    the Committee at its next meeting.

                      AUDIT .OF STATISTICAL REP.ORTS
       The nmference was inf.Ormed that the Bankruptcy Divisi.On .Of
    the Administrative Office is c.Ontinuing its examinati.On .Of statisti­
    cal rep.Orts .Of cl.Osed asset bankruptcy cases f.Or the determinati.On
    .Of err.Ors in the c.Omputati.On .Of am.Ounts due the Referees' Salary
    and Expense Fund and overpayments of compensation t.O receivers
    and trustees.
       The Committee P.Ointed out, however, that there is at present
    no systematic examinati.On .Of C.Osts of administrati.On f.Or the 400
    or m.Ore arrangement proceedings successfully c.Oncluded annually
    under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. Up.On rec.Ommendati.On
    of the Committee, the C.Onference authorized the extension of the
    audit program to include arrangement pr.Oceedings concluded under
    Chapter XI.
                         MATTERS UNDER ADVISEMENT
       Referees in bankruptcy reported a slight increase in the last 6
    months in the number .Of matters held under advisement f.Or longer
    than 60 days. The list shows, however, that at the time of the re­
    P.Orts .Only 31 .Of the 208 referees presently in office had any matters
    held under submission m.Ore than 60 days. The Bankruptcy Divi­
    sion .Of the Administrative Office is continuing to keep the judges
    and the Committee informed .Of these matters.

             DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE .OF CHAPTER XIII
       The Conference was inf.Ormed that the filing .Of Chapter XIII
    cases in the district courts has leveled off at approximately 28,000
    cases per year. Last year trustees in Chapter XIII cases reported
    total collections fr.Om debtors of appr.Oximately $33,000,000 and
    payments t.O creditors .Of almost $26,500,000.
       The use of electr.Onic data processing systems by trustees f.Or the
    distributi.On of checks and the preparati.On of rep.Orts appears to
    be gaining. Indications are that eventually ec.Onomies will be
    made in this method .Of rec.Ord keeping. The Conference was also
    inf.Ormed that the guidelines for the administrati.On of Chapter
    XIII cases, promulgated by the C.Onference at the September 1963
    sessi.On (C.Onf. Rept., p. 87), are now being c.Omplied with generally
(
                                24 

by the courts. In one metropolitan area, however, the referees con­
tinue to use more than one Chapter XIII trustee.                       /-~"

                    SEMINARB FOR REFEREES

   Judge Hamlin informed the Conference that the third seminar
for referees in bankruptcy is scheduled to be held in Washington,
D.C., during the week of March 28. Altogether, 44 referees have
been invited as participants. In addition, two regional seminars
of 2 days each have recently been held, one in Los Angeles and the
other in Atlanta. Three additional regional seminars are planned
and are expected to be held prior to the end of the fiscal year. The
regional seminars are being conducted by experienced referees and
attendance has- been limited to those referees who have attended
one of the annual seminars held in Washington, D.C. Reports
from these regional seminars indicate that the program thus far has
been highly successful.
                        COURT REPORTING

  It had been reported to the Committee that in a number of
courts the charges made by freelance reporters in the bankruptcy
court are in @xcess of the established rates prescribed by the Con­    (
ference for official court reporters for the district courts. The
Committee, accordingly, has authorized the Bankruptcy Division
of the Administrative Office to communicate with the referees in
these distriets with a view to reducing these charges to the level
of the rates established for the official court reporters.
           TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE
   Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Committee on
Trial Practice and Technique, informed the Conference that, in
view of the passage of the new omnibus judgeship bill, the Com­
mittee will undertake to formulate plans for a new seminar, or
series of seminars, for newly appointed United States district
judges. The Committee is also continuing its studies on the effi­
eient utilization of judicial manpower through the use of pretrial
procedure and other improved techniques of judicial administra­
tion.

                 SUBCOMMITTEE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION

         Judge Edwin A. Robson, a member of the Subcommittee Ap­
      pointed to Consider Discovery Problems Arising in Multiple Liti­
      gation with Common Witnesses and Exhibits, presented to the
      Conference a comprehensive report concerning the progress made
      in the coordination of the private antitrust suits arising out of the
      criminal antitrust proceedings in the electrical equipment industry
      in Philadelphia in 1961. The report showed that as of February
      1966 there remained for disposition only 360 cases, involving 3,855
      claims for relief, out of the 1,912 suits originally filed, involving
      25,714 separate claims. Cases remain for disposition in only 17 of
      the 36 districts in which they were filed and the subcommittee ex­
      pects that this litigation will be concluded by the end of the year.
      The Conference was also informed that the proposal to establish a
      judicial panel on multidistrict litigation and to permit transfer of '
     such cases for pretrial purposes, approved by the Conference in
      March 1965 (Conf. Rept., p. 12), had been introduced in the House
     of Representatives as H.R. 8276, 89th Congress. The report also
     outlined the action taken by the subcommittee in the so-called
     <Crock salt" and "aluminum cable" antitrust cases and described
(    the study being conducted of court dockets to discover pending
     multidistrict litigation and to develop methods for its prompt iden­
     tification.
         The Conference discussed the work of the subcommittee and the
     steps being taken to coordinate discovery matters in multidistrict
     litigation, other than the electrical equipment cases. After full
    'consideration the Conference voted to approve the concept of the
     subcommittee's work, as expressed in its report, including the rec­
     ommendation of appropriate legislation in this field. Chief Judges
     Chambers, Lumbard, Harper, Madden and Ryan were recorded in
     opposition to this motion.
                EXAMINATION OF COURT OFFICES
      On motion of Chief Judge Harper, the Conference authorized
    the Chief Justice to refer to the appropriate committee of the
    Conference, for study and report to the Conferen~, a proposal to
    place the examination of court offices under the jurisdiction of the

PLACES OF HOLDING COURT IN THE NORTHERN
          DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
   The Conference at its March 1965 session (Coni. Rept., p. 5)
approved a suggestion to eliminate, as unnecessary, a provision in
the pending omnibus judgeship bill requiring judges to reside
at certain places of holding court in the Northern District of Cali­
fornia. It was pointed out that under existing law, 28 U.S.C.
134( c), the Judicial Council of the Circuit has authority to fix the
residence of a district judge when the public interest and the nature
of the business of the court so require. The Conference, there­
upon, approved the pending judgeship bill with this and other
modifications and voted to recommend to the Judicial Council of
the Ninth Circuit that "upon the enactment of this legislation
action be taken to designate one or more judges to reside and have
their official stations at Oakland and at San Jose in the Northern
District of California."
  Chief Judge Chambers informed the Conference that in view of
this action by the Conference, which had been relied upon by mem­
bers of Congress and others, he would take whatever steps were
necessary to comply with the Conference recommendation.
                                                                        (
  PRETERMISSION OF THE TERMS OF COURTS OF 

                  APPEALS 

  At the request of Chief Judge Charles J. Vogel, the Conference,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that terms of the Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be
pretermitted during the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1966.
  At the request of Chief Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., the
Conference consented to the pretermission of the term of court of
the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit scheduled to be held at
Asheville, North Carolina in June 1966.
            RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
on matters considered at this session where necessary for legislative
or administrative action.
  For the Judicial Conference of the United States.
