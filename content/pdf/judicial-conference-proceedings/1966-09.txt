REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRA­
 TIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office of the
U.S. Courts, had previously submitted to the members of the
Conference his report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966, in
accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 604(a) (3). The Con­
ference authorized the immediate release of the report for publica­
tion and authorized the Director to revise and supplement the
final printed edition to be issued later.

                      STATE OF THE DOCKETS

   Courts of Appeals.-The increasing judicial workload was par­
ticularly reflected in the statistics for the courts of appeals with 6
percent more cases docketed in fiscal year 1966 than in the prior
year. Although the courts of appeals disposed of 800 more cases
in the year ending June 30, 1966, reflecting a total of 6,571 dis- (
                                          31 


         positions, they were 612 less than the number of appeals com~
    (	   menced. As a result, for the eighth consecutive year appeals
         pending in courts of appeals continued to increase, reflecting at the
         end of 1966 the all-time high of 5,387.
            The largest increase in docketing of new appeals occurred last
         year in the District of Columbia, Third, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits.
         The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit continued to be the
         most heavily burdened, with a 3-percent increase in appeals dock­
         eted. The practice of assignment of judges from both within the
         circuit and from other circuits has continued and has been of sub­
         stantial assistance in the Fifth Circuit.
            The increased workload in the courts of appeals was particularly
         characterized by appeals in criminal cases, which in the past 2
         years have increased 40 percent. Appeals rose over those in 1965
         by more than 19 percent in criminal cases, climbing from 1,223 in
         1965 to 1,458 in 1966.
            District Courts.-Pending civil cases in the district courts
         climbed to a record high of 79,117 as of June 30, 1966, Mr. Olney
         reports. The number of filings increased 5 percent, so that despite
         the fact that more civil cases were terminated than in the previous
         year, the total pending caseload figure reached a new high. Efforts
(        to reduce the number of civil cases pending more than 3 years lagged
         in 1966. Civil actions in this category increased from 6,626 to
         7,427 in 1966, a 12-percent increase. About half of these cases
         were pending in three districts: Southern New York, eastern Penn­
         sylvania, and eastern Louisiana.
            The criminal cases removed from State to Federal courts showed
         a sharp decline, from 1,192 in 1965 to 383 in 1966. Total criminal
         actions filed in the district courts, excluding removed cases, de­
         clined to a 3-year low of 29,346, a decrease of 3 percent from the
         prior year.
            Habeas corpus petitions and other actions filed by persons in
         custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court again increased,
         however, to 5,950, reflecting a 19-percent rise over 1965. Motions
         to vacate sentence, on the other hand, filed by persons in Federal
         custody under 28 U.S.C. 2255, declined almost 37 percent, reversing
         a trend of the past few years.
            Bankruptcy :filings also increased sharply during 1966. New
         cases numbered 192,354, a 7~percent increase over 1965. Non~
I        business bankruptcies, in particular employee bankruptcies, con­
\~            286-1'15-66--2
                                 32 

tinue to increase at a faster rate than business bankruptcies and
in 1966 accounted for more than 91 percent of all bankruptcy
cases. Referees in bankruptcy closed 186,219 cases as compared
with 175,117 in 1965, but filings continued to outstrip terminations,
so that the pending caseload on June 30, 1966, reached the record
total of 168,507.
   Additional Judgeships.-The Director's report pointed out that
during fiscal year 1966 Congress enacted legislation authorizing
10 additional judgeships in the courts of appeals, including 4
temporary positions in the Fifth Circuit, and 35 judgeships in the
district courts. The report points out that this legislation, Public
Law 89-372, approved March 18, 1966, follows in large measure
recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States.
                     SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

   In a specific case presented by the Director, the Conference
instructed him that the appointment of a law clerk and a bailiff­
messenger should not be processed for a judge who had been cer­
tified as permanently disabled under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.
372(b) by the Judicial Council of his circuit and who had also been
found to be permanently disabled by the President of the United (
States in appointing an additional judge as provided in section
372(b). In this instance, in response to an inquiry from the
Director, the Judicial Council of the circuit had informed the
Director that the judge's physical condition had not changed,
that he remained unable to discharge the duties of his office, that
the Council knew of no judicial function performed by him over
a period of some 3 years and that the Council knew of no necessity
for the employment of any person or persons to serve the judge
in his judicial capacity and of no reason why the public good
would be served by the employment of such person or persons.
                JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief Judge
William J. Campbell, advised the Conference that the judiciary
appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1967 had not yet been reported
out by the House Appropriations Committee. The judiciary,
therefore, was operating under continuing resolutions of the Con­
                                     33 

    gress limiting the program and activities of the courts to the
(   amounts authorized in the previous year.
       The budget estimate for the judiciary for fiscal year 1967, exclu­
    sive of the Supreme Court of the United States, as submitted to
    the Congress, was $88,949,900. The estimate was subsequently
    amended to include $4,735,000 to cover the cost of the additional
    circuit and district judges authorized by Public Law 89-372 and
    the two new judicial districts in California. The estimate was
    also amended to the extent of $127,000 to cover the cost of two
    additional judgeships authorized for the Court of Claims. The
    total budget estimate, excluding the Supreme Court, was thus
    $93,811,900. This represents $13,285,200 more than the obliga­
    tional authority granted for fiscal year 1966.
       The Conference authorized submission of a request for supple­
    mental appropriations for fiscal year 1967 as a result of the enact­
    ment of the Federal Salary and Fringe Benefits Act of 1966.
       The Budget Committee recommended and the Conference ap­
    proved the budget estimates for the fiscal year 1968 which, exclusive
    of the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Customs Court, aggregated
    $91,851,200. The estimate for 1968 provides for 9 additional
    deputy clerks for the U.S. courts of appeals, 59 additional deputy
(   clerks for the U.S. district courts, 2 additional positions for the
    Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, 6 additional full-time
    referees-in-bankruptcy, the conversion of 2 part-time referees to
    full-time status and 1 full-time referee to part-time status and
    40 additional clerical employees for the bankruptcy system. Pro­
    vision was made for the reclassification of the secretaries to the
    commissioners of the U.S. Court of Claims, within-grade salary
    advancements for judicial personnel and for other miscellaneous
    expenses of the courts. The estimate included the sum of
    $3,500,000 to cover fees and expenses of court-appointed counsel
    in fiscal year 1968.
       The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
    Office to request for fiscal year 1968 any positions included in the
    1967 budget which may be denied by the Congress. The Director
    was also authorized to revise the budget estimates for 1968 and
    submit to Congress estimates of supplemental appropriations re­
    quired for any purpose which could not be anticipated at the time
    of the submission of the 1968 appropriations request to the
    Conference.

                    JUDICIAL STATISTICS
  Senior Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman of the Committee
on Judicial Statistics, presented the Committee's report to the
Conference.
                        COURTS OF ApPEALS

   Pursuant to the authorization of the Conference at its Septem­
ber 1965 session (Conf. Rept., p. 47), further consideration is being
given by the Committee to the aspects of the survey and study
which it is attempting to make of the work of the courts of appeals
in both their individual and their system status. Judge Johnsen
reported that the Committee has succeeded in obtaining the services
of Mr. Will Shafroth, former Deputy Director of the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts, to undertake the necessary field work
aimed at studying the varying practices among the courts of ap­
peals in the handling of their administrative and judicial loads.
Judge Johnsen advised that his Committee would report further to
the Conference at its next meeting.
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

   Although a number of requests for recommendations for addi­
tional judgeships for various district courts have been received, the
Committee passed over these recommendations until the Commit­
tee's next overall consideration and evaluation of the need for
additional judgeships.
                  THREE-YEAR-OLD CIVIL CASES

   The Conference at its September 1961 sesSion declared that
3-year-old civil cases then pending which were appropriate for
trial should be considered as a judicial emergency and be dealt
with on that basis (Conf. Rept., p. 61). The Committee reported
at the March 1963 session of the Conference that substantial and
continuing progress in attention to and disposition of these 3-year­
old civil cases had been achieved. Accordingly, the Conference
approved the recommendation that thereafter each district court
deal with such cases in regular programmed effort (Conf. Rept.,
p. 46).
  Judge Johnsen reported that the reduction effected by 1963 has
not been maintained and that the volume of pending 3-year-old
                                           35 

       cases 	has risen progressively each year since. The percentage
(      climb of pending 3-year-old cases has been far beyond the per­
       centage increase in general pending cases. The practice by which
       the Administrative Office at the close of each fiscal year sends
       to the chief judge of each circuit a list of the 3-year-old cases pend­
       ing in the district courts of his circuit has not achieved the result
       which the Committee hoped and, accordingly, the Conference ap­
       proved the following resolution.
            The Conference requests the Director of the Administrative Office by
          transmittal of copies of this resolution to call the attention of all the
          judges of the district courts to the fact that the number of three-year-old
          cases pending in the federal system has continued to increase materially
          since 1963 and to remind them of the request which the Conference made
          at its March 1963 session that each district court undertake to deal with
          such cases in a continuing regular programmed effort for effecting disposi­
          tion of them.

                   STATISTICS UNDER THE BAIL REFORM               ACT
          Judge Johnsen advised that the Committee had considered the
       likelihood of an increased demand for statistical information on
       the operation of the Bail Reform Act. The Committee has, how­
( .	   ever, adopted the view that the Administrative Office should not
       be asked to gather or maintain such statistics since the demand
       for information would seem to be capable of being dealt with by
       the Department of Justice. The files of the U.S. attorneys will
       presumably contain a notation as to the nature of the bail action
       taken both by the commissioner and by the district court in each
       criminal case.
                  FORM 	JS-IO-INFORMATlON ON TRIAL DAYS

          Judge Johnsen stressed that the information requested on Admin­
       istrative Office Form JS-lO as to the number of trial days engaged
       in by each district judge was a factor of value in obtaining a
       comprehension as to the comparative nature of the judicial work
       involved in a district as against another in an overall appraisal of
       the need for additional judge power. The Conference directed the
       Committee to make a continuing study of this form and of the
       data which must be furnished in this form in an effort to obtain
       a realistic reflection of judicial workloads.

                   COURT ADMINISTRATION
  In the absence of Senior Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the
Committee on Court Administration, the Committee's report was
presented by Chief Judge John S. Hastings.
                   PLACES OF HOLDING CoURT

   H.R. 14391, 89th Congress, provides for the establishment of
an additional division in the Western District of Texas in the
Midland-Odessa area with an additional place of holding court
at Odessa. This legislation, recommended by the Judicial Council
of the Fifth Circuit and approved by the Conference at its March
1966 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 5), was again approved by the
Conference. H.R. 15796 and H.R. 10867 which differ from H.R.
14391 in certain material respects were disapproved by the Con­
ference.
   S. 2070, 89th Congress, which would amend 28 U.S.c. 122 to
add Rapid City as an additional place of holding court in the
District of South Dakota, previously approved by the Judicial
Council of the Eighth Circuit and by the Judicial Conference at (
its September 1965 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 56), was again ap­
proved by the Conference.
   The Conference disapproved H.R. 13658, 89th Congress, pro­
viding for the establishment of a northern and southern division
within the District of Maryland, and H.R. 15742 and H.R. 15981,
89th Congress, both providing for the holding of court at Hyatts­
ville within the District of Maryland.
   The Conference approvedS. 3533andH.R.15418, 89th Congress,
both bills to transfer Haywood County from the Western to the
Eastern Division of the Western District of Tennessee. The Con­
ference was informed that this proposal had received the approval
of the Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit.
                       JUDICIAL DISABILITY

  The Conference at its March 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 6)
recommended that two draft bills submitted to the Conference
be discussed at the Judicial Conferences of the circuits to be held
in 1966. The replies received from the chief judges of the circuits
reflecting discussions of these proposals at the circuit conferences
were considered by the Conference and the Committee was directed
                                      37 

     to study the proposals and the replies further and report back at
     a subsequent session of the Conference.
                       LAW BOOKS FOR NEW JUDGES

       The Conference approved the suggestion of the Administrative
     Office that U.S. Reports furnished to new judges should start with
     volume 257 instead of volume 200.
                     EXAMINATION OF COURT OFFICES

        The Conference at its March 1966 session authorized the Chief
     Justice to refer to the appropriate committee of the Conference
     the suggestion of Chief Judge Roy W. Harper that the examina­
     tion of court offices be placed under the jurisdiction of the Admin­
     istrative Office of the U.S. Courts rather than the Department of
     Justice (Conf. Rept., p. 25). Judge Hastings reported that the
     Committee on Court Administration has undertaken a preliminary
     study of the matter and the Conference authorized further study
     and subsequent report on this matter. In this connection, Chief
     Judge Bazelon presented a resolution of the Judicial Council of
(	   the District of Columbia Circuit urging the establishment within
     the Administrative Office of review and inspection units because
     of the increased volume and complexity of the work of the clerks
     of the U.S. courts. Consideration of this resolution was also
     referred by the Conference to the Committee on Court Adminis­
     tration for study.
              CONTINUING EDUCATION, REsEARCH, TRAINING
                           AND ADMINISTRATION

        Judge Hastings next discussed the ever-expanding work of the
     Conference and its committees, the additional demands for staff
     support and the requirements for research, as well as the impor­
     tance of continuing programs of education for court personnel, the
     judges, referees, probation officers and U.S. commissioners. He
     pointed out that the demands on the small staff of the Adminis­
     trative Office were already heavy and suggested the need for con­
     gressional approval of a broad expansion of Conference programs.
     Mter considering these suggestions the Conference authorized a
     study of the possible need for congressional authorization of a
(    broad program of continuing education, training, resea.roh and
administration by an appropriate committee to be designated or
appointed. by the Chief Justice for report to the next session of
the Conference.

                  REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on
Revision of the Laws, submitted the report of the committee.

                FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION

  Since May 1959 the American Law Institute has been engaged
in a study of the appropriate division of jurisdiction between the
State and Federal courts. The first part of the study relating to
the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal courts has been completed
and an official draft published. The second part involving the
Federal question jurisdiction is nearing completion. The Confer­
ence decided that consideration of the results of the American
Law Institute study should be deferred until both parts of it have
been completed and until the reactions of the bench and bar to it
have been received. The Conference instructed the Director of
the Administrative Office to request the bench and bar of the
country to examine the final reports of the Institute's study
promptly upon completion of this study and to request comment
and suggestions for use of the Conference in its own study of the
Institute's final reports.
                         JURY SELECTION

   S. 2923, 89th Congress, is a bill relating to jury selection in
Federal and State courts, prosecution and removal to Federal
courts, civil preventive relief and civil indemnification. Although
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary has requested the view of
the Conference on this bill, the Conference took the position that
it should not give any opinion at this time in view of the other
pending legislation in the same area.
           COURT OF LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS

   S. 2891, 89th Congress, is a bill which would establish a U.S.
Court of Labor-Management Relations which would have juris­
diction over labor disputes which result in work stoppages that
adversely affect the public interest of the Nation to a substantial
                                     39 

    degree. This proposal was studied by the Committee on Revision
    of the Laws and the Committee on Court Administration. These
    committees were of the view that the proposed legislation would
    provide for a permanent compulsory arbitration authority without
    effective limitation on its jurisdiction or the duration of its judg­
    ments. The committees also questioned whether the settlement
    of labor disputes and the fixing of wages and conditions of employ­
    mentare judicial functions under Article III of the Constitution
    and, on the other hand, whether if the legislation creates a legis­
    lative court, such a court could use the judicial function of issuing
    injunctions. Upon recommendation of the committees, the Con­
    ference disapproved the bill.
            ApPEALS FRoM THE} HIGH CoURT OF THE TRUST
                     TERRITORY OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS

       The Bureau of the Budget had requested the view of the Con­
    ference on a Department of the Interior draft bill to provide for
    appeals to the District Court of Guam from the High Court of
    the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and to give the District
    Court of Guam jurisdiction of Federal cases arising in the trust
(   territory. The Conference approved the draft bill but suggested
    that clarification be made in the text of the bill to show that the
    jurisdiction thus granted to the District Court of Guam would be
    concurrent with that of the High Court of the Trust Territory
    and that it would not include cases arising under the local law of
    the trust territory promulgated by the High Commissioner even
    though he has acted under the authority of the President pursuant
    to the Act of June 30, 1954 (68 Stat. 330) which conferred upon
    the President the power to govern the trust territory. The Con­
    ference was also of the view that it should be made explicit in the
    bill that the provisions of the local law of Guam providing that
    jury trials in the District Court of Guam should not be applicable
    to the District Court of Guam when sitting in the trust territory
    unless and until made so applicable by the local law of the trust
    territory. The Conference took the position that the proposal in
    the bill to confer upon the District Court of Guam jurisdiction
    over claims against the United States, both in tort and contract,
    arising in Guam and the trust teITitory is a question. of public
    policy with respect to the recognition and enforcement of claims
         236-175--66----3
                                 40 

against the United States and, thus, is a matter for congressional
determination.
                       OTHER LEGISLATION

   The Conference also considered other legislative proposals on
recommendation of the Committee on Revision of the Laws and
took the following action:
   (a) H.R.16550, 89th Congress, would amend the Administrative
Procedure Act and related statutes so as to designate hearing
examiners as ((administrative judges." The Conference was of
the opinion that the designation "hearing examiner" is well under­
stood and that the proposed change would be inappropriate and
confusing. Accordingly, the Conference voted its disapproval of
the proposal.
   (b) S. 3351, 89th Congress, a bill to amend 28 U.S.C. 1651, and
S. 3352, 89th Congress, a bill to amend 28 U.S.C. 1292, are both
designed to prohibit the issuance of writs of mandamus and prohibi­
tion by the courts of appeals based upon interlocutory or non­
appealable orders of the district courts or a substitute for inter­
locutory appeals allowable under Section 1292(b) of Title 28,
United States Code. The Conference was of the view that the             (
powers now resting in the courts of appeals in this area are salutary
and necessary to protect litigants from the abuse of authority and,
accordingly, disapproved both bills.
   (c) S. 3631, 89th Congress, would abolish the National Labor
Relations Board and in its place establish a U.S. labor court with
substantially the same functions of the present board and would
confer upon the court the power to enforce its decisions without
reference to the Court of Appeals. The Conference agreed with
the committee's recommendation that many of the functions which
would be assigned to the court are not judicial in nature and,
accordingly, voted its disapproval of the proposal.
   (d) The Conference reaffirmed its previous approval of Sep­
tember 1965 (ConI. Rept., p. 62) endorsing S. 3254, 89th Con­
gress (which is identical with H.R. 7538, 89th Cong.), to amend
sections 2072 and 2112 of Title 28, United States Code so as to
empower the Supreme Court to enlarge the scope of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure to include the procedure in the courts of
appeals in civil actions as well as the procedure in the district
courts and the courts of appeals for the judicial review or enforce­
men t of orders of administrative agencies.
                                     41

       (e) The Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of H.R. 16164,
    89th Congress, to provide means for the disqualification of circuit
    judges for bias and prejudice. The bill is substantially similar to
    S. 578, 89th Congress, which the Conference had disapproved at its
    March 1965 session (Conf. Rept., p. 7).

            RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
      Senior Judge Maris, Chairman of the standing Committee on
    Rules of Practice and Procedure, reported to the Conference on the
    activities of the standing committee and the advisory committees.

                            ApPELLATE RULES

      Judge Maris reported that the standing committee gave detailed
    consideration to a definitive draft of Uniform Appellate Rules for
    the Courts of Appeals and with one exception approved the draft
    of the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules. The exception is
    concerned with providing for the use of the judges of the courts
    of appeals the parts of the record which they need to consider in
    deciding an appeal. The advisory committee had proposed a
    method different from that proposed in the last draft circulated
(   for comment in March 1964 and different from the method followed
    in a majority of the courts of appeals at the present time. The
    standing committee concluded, therefore, that the four alternative
    methods which have been considered by the advisory committee
    should be published and that the comments and suggestions of the
    bench and bar should be given full consideration before a final
    recommendation with respect to this portion of the proposed
    appellate rules is made.
                               CIVIL RULES

      The Advisory Committee on Civil Rules is in the final stage of
    completing a tentative draft of proposed amendments to the rules
    relating to discovery. It is anticipated that this draft will shortly
    be published and distributed to the bench and bar for consideration
    and suggestions.
                           BANKRUPTCY RULES

      The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules is hard at work
    on its task of preparing a draft of comprehensive rules of practice
(   and procedure under the Bankruptcy Act which will supersede the
                                42 

present general orders and procedural provisions of the act. This
is a major task which will take some time to complete.
                        CRIMINAL RULES

   The amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
which went into effect July 1, 1966, covered most of the criminal
procedure. The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is con­
tinuing to study the subject of preliminary hearings and motions,
however, but is not yet ready to report thereon.
                       RULES OF EVIDENCE

  The Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence is actively en­
gaged in the work of formulating a draft of uniform rules of evi­
dence for the Federal district courts, a formidable task which will
take some time to complete.
                       ADMIRALTY RULES

  The Conference approved the recommendation of the standing
committee that the Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules
should continue in existence for at least 2 years in order to study   (
the operation of the new amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure which went into effect July 1, 1966 and merged the
admiralty and civil procedure but providing supplemental rules
for certain distinctive admiralty procedure. At the expiration of
2 years the Conference will consider whether the advisory com­
mittee should be continued for a further period or whether a repre­
sentative group of its members or other admiralty specialists
should be included within the membership of the Advisory Com­
mittee on Civil Rules.
           REVISED RULES FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has revised its
rules, effective July 1, 1966. The Conference approved those of
the rules which relate to the review and enforcement of the orders
of administrative agencies in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 1041 (now
28 U.S.C. 2352) and 28 U.S.C. 2112.


                                                                      (

             INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
       The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Intercircuit
     Assignments, Circuit Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported on the
     processing of requests for intercircuit assignments for the period
     February 18, 1966 through August 27, 1966. During this period
     the committee recommended 14 assignments to be undertaken by
     13 judges. The Chief Justice approved all assignments recom­
     mended by the committee. The assigned judges included one
     circuit judge, three senior circuit judges, four district judges, three
     senior district judges, one senior judge of the Court of Claims
     and one senior judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
     Of the assignments made, six were for service in the courts of
     appeals and the remainder for district courts. One judge accepted
     two assign men ts.
       The committee noted that despite the provisions of Public Law
     89-372 providing additional judgeships for the Fifth Circuit, the
     needs of the Court of Appeals for that circuit continue and will
     require assistance from without the circuit to dispose of a sub­
     stantial backlog. The cOmmittee pointed out also that the Court
     of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has had an unexpectedly heavy
(	   increase in filings and that some of the district courts also badly
     need additional judicial help.

                  BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
        Senior Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., Chairman of the Committee
     on Bankruptcy Administration, reported that the committee had
     considered the recommendations contained in the survey report
     of the Director of the Administrative Office, dated. June 27, 1966,
     relating to the continuance of referee positions to become vacant
     by expiration of term, for four new referee positions and for
     changes in salaries and arrangements for referees. The committee
     also considered the recommendations of the district judges and
     circuit councils concerned..
        On the basis of the reports and recommendations, the Confer­
     ence took the following action with respect to referee positions
     and changes in salaries and arrangements. Unless otherwise noted,
     changes are effective October 1, 1966, or as soon hereafter as ap­
     propriated funds are available.

                               SECOND CIRCUIT
Distriot of Oonneotiout
    (1) 	 Authorized  the fun-time referee position at Hartford in which the term
        of office will expire on Oetober 81, 1966 to be continued for a new 6-year
        term, effective November 1, 1966, at the present salary, the regular
        place of office, territory, and places of holding court to remain as at
        present.

                               ApPROPRIATIONS

   The Conference noted that as of the time of its meeting, no
report had been received from the Appropriations Committees of
the Congress with respect to appropriations for the bankruptcy
courts for fiscal year 1967.
   The Conference was advised that it will be necessary to obtain
an increase in the appropriation for salaries of referees in an
amount of $74,000 for the annual cost of new referee positions
and salary increases authorized at the March 1966 session of the                          f
                                                                                          i
Judicial Conference and an additional amount of approximately
$140,000 as a result of the recommendations adopted by the Con­                           I
ference at its current session. The income from the system in
fiscal years 1966 and 1967 is expected to equal or exceed the obli­
gations from these 2 fiscal years and leave a balance of approxi­
mately $11,000,000 in the referees' salary and expense fund and
in the treasury.
                            NEW CASE FILINGS

  Judge Hamlin reported that in fiscal year 1965 a total of 180,323
cases was filed in the bankruptcy courts. In 1966 the total in­
creased 6.7 percent to a new high of 192,354 cases. Of these,
approximately 91.4 percent were nonbusiness or so-called "con­
sumer" bankruptcy cases. Total filings in 1967 are estimated to
reach 200,000 to 205,000 cases.
                    AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   The Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office is con-                         'I
tinuing the examination of statistical reports of closed asset and
nominal asset bankruptcy cases for the determination of errors in
the computation of amounts due the referees' salary and expense                         "I)
fund and overpayments of compensation to receivers and trustees.
   The audit program of the Bankruptcy Division will be expanded
to include arrangement proceedings terminated under chapter XI
                                     49 

during fiscal year 1967, in accordance with Conference               authori~
zation at the March 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 23).

                    MATl'ERS UNDER ADVISEMENT

   The Conference was advised of a gradual overall improvement
in the reports of matters held under advisement by referees 60 days
or longer. As of mid-July, 1966, only 25 referees out of 186 who
had submitted reports for the quarter ending June 30, 1966, re­
ported any matters under submission 60 days or longer.

          DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER                 XIII
   Filings in chapter XIII cases in fiscal year 1966 increased about
Ilh percent over 1965. The Bankruptcy Division of the Admin­
istrative Office conducts a careful review of the financial reports
of chapter XIII trustees supplied to the Administrative Office pur­
suant to the guidelines adopted by the Conference at the September
1963 session (Conf. Rept., p. 87). The reports of accountants
who audit the records of chapter XIII trustees are also examined
when they are supplied.
   Because of the necessity for adequate supervision of the fiscal
aspects of wage earner plan administration, the Conference
approved the committee's recommendations for the adoption of
additional guidelines to apply to all chapter XIII trustees who
have 50 or more wage earner prooeedings under supervision as
follows:
      (1) The trustees shall maintain debtor funds in a consolidated bank
   account;
      (2) Trial balances shall be submitted to the referee not less frequently
   than semiaunually;
      (3) Copies of annual audit report·s shall be forwarded to the Admin­
   istrative Office for review and comment and the referee shall accompany
   the report with a statement of the action he has taken to have rectified any
   discrepancies reported by the accountant.

                       SEMINARS FOR REFEREES

  The third annual seminar for referees-in-bankruptcies was held
in Washington March 28 through April 1, 1966. Forty-four ref­
erees attended as participants. Five regional seminars of 2 days
each were held at Los Angeles, Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City
and Chicago. These regional seminars are a form of continuing
                                50
legal education for referees who have attended one of the annual
seminars in Washington. The Conference was advised that the
response of the referees who have attended the seminars indicates
that the program is highly beneficial and successful. The Con­
ference was advised that during the next 2 years the remaining
57 referees will be given an opportunity to attend an annual
seminar in Washington.
                   COSTS OF ADMINISTRATION

   The Conference noted that tables prepared by the Bankruptcy
Division reveal that in 1965 costs of administration were 25.7
percent in asset cases having an average realization of $5,227
compared to 26.6 percent in asset cases having an average realiza­
tion of $4,840 in 1964. The Conference noted that in those
districts where the costs of administration exceeded the 1965
national average, the matter has been brought to the attention
of the chief judges with a solicitation of the cooperation of the
judges and referees in reducing these costs. As in previous years,
attorneys' fees represent the largest single item of cost.
             CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964                              (
  Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman of the Committee to
Implement the Criminal Justice Act, presented the report of the
committee.
                ApPOINTMENTS UNDER THE ACT

  The Conference noted a report prepared by the Administrative
Office on appointments of attorneys and payments of claims under
the Criminal Justice Act covering the first year of the operation of
the statute, namely, from August 20,1965 to August 31,1966. The
report showed that in that period 8,984 attorneys had been paid,
representing 15,998 defendants. Of this number, 112 attorneys
represented 560 defendants in the courts of appeals, the remaining
attorneys represented defendants in the district courts and before
U.S. commissioners. A total of $960,721.83 was paid as compen­
                                                                           I
sation to attorneys appointed under the act and $22,937.20 was             .
paid as attorneys' expenses. A total of $178,585.18 was paid for
investigative, expert and other services. Of this sum, $153,390.55
was for the payment of transcripts. The average cost per case
                                            51 

     in the courts of appeals was $341 and in the district courts and
     before commissioners $108.

                              PROTRACTED LITIGATION

       Judge Hastings advised the Conference that during the first year
     of the operation of the statute several opinions have been handed
     down by chief judges of the circuits, as well as by trial judges,
     relating to the subject of compensation to counsel in cases of
     protracted litigation. The statutory provision states that in ex­
     traordinary circumstances payment in excess of the limits set forth
     in the statute may be made if the district court certifies that such
     payment is necessary to provide fair compensation for protracted
     representation and that the amount of the excess payment is ap­
     proved by the chief judge of the circuit. The Conference author­
     ized the Administrative Office to transmit a representative group
     of nine opinions on this subject to all Federal judges.

                                         FORMS

       The Conference approved a committee recommendation that
     the present voucher forms previously approved by the Conference,
     namely, CJA Form 4 and CJA Form 12, be amended to provide
     that while the appointed counsel will calculate his total requested
     fee and expenses, the approving judge will approve only the pay­
     ment in a total sum for fees and for expenses. The Administrative
     Office was directed to confer with the General Accounting Office to
     obtain the approval of the Comptroller General for the changes in
     these two forms.
                                         TRAVEL

        At its March 1966 session, the Conference adopted a statement
     of policy to serve as a guideline to the courts in determining the
     appropriateness of payments to attorneys for time spent in travel
     to and from court (Conf. Rept., p. 13). The Conference noted
     that the guideline had caused some differing interpretations as to
     whether counsel might be compensated for travel undertaken out­
     side of normal working hours. Accordingly, the addition of a final
     clause to the guideline was approved so that the guideline now
     reads:
            When the travel time of an attorney from his office to and from court
~.       is 1 hour or more, the court in its discretion, after taking into consideration
                                      52
    all the surrounding circumstances, may allow compensation for time spent
    in such travel, at a rate not exceeding $10 per hour; provided, that such
    travel is solely i.n the performance of duties in representing a defendant
    pursuant to an appointment under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, and
    that compensation shall be allowed only for time spent in travel during the
    normal working hours of the attorney's office.

                     ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACT

  Judge Hastings reported on several matters which have arisen
in connection with the administration of the Criminal Justice Act:

                Revocation of Probation Proceedings
   In accordance with the authorization of the Conference at its
March 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 13), the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Office submitted to the Comptroller General a test
claim regarding the applicability of the act to representation of a
defendant in proceedings for revocation of probation. The Comp­
troller General, by letter of June 13, 1966, advised that in his opinion
the act did not apply to such proceedings.

         District of Columbia Court of General Sessions
   At its March 1966 session, the Conference authorized (Conf. (
Rept., p. 14) the Director of the Administrative Office to submit
to the Comptroller General a proper voucher as a test case to
determine whether a judge of the Court of General Sessions of the
District of Columbia sitting as a committing magistrate in Federal
cases may appoint counsel under the terms of the Criminal Justice
Act. The opinion of the Comptroller General, dated June 15,
1966, holds that the Criminal Justice Act applies to all cases in
the U.S. branch of the Court of General Sessions. By subsequent
letter of July 27, 1966, the Comptroller General further advised
that the statute applies to the payment of costs of transcripts in
the Court of General Sessions to which court the provisions of the
Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. 753, do not extend.
  The Conference also noted that the committee considered a
request of the Clerk of the Court of General Sessions for permission
to print new forms for the use of that court and the committee's
view that the forms now in use and previously approved by the
Conference are adequate and can be utilized by the Court of
General Sessions.

                      Corporate Defendants
  Judge Hastings advised the Conference that the Administrative
Office had received vouchers in two cases in which counsel had
been appointed for corporate defendants. He advised the Con­
ference that the committee had directed the Administrative Office
not to process such vouchers since in the committee's view the
statute applies only to natural defendants and not to corporate
defendants.
                    STATUTORY AMENDMENTS

   Judge Hastings advised the Conference that several suggestions
for possible amendment to the statute had originated in the Depart­
ment of Justice and had been forwarded to the committee.
   The committee also considered the mandate of the Conference
Committee of the Congress that the Department of Justice, in
cooperation with the Judicial Conference, obtain the benefit of
the experience of the operation of the act and report to the Congress
on the advisability of the establishment of a public defender system.
   Judge Hastings reported that the committee was in agreement
that sufficient experience had not yet been obtained and sufficient
accurate information on costs had not yet been received to carry
out the congressional request or to warrant recommendations at
this time for amendment of the statute. To carry out these pur­
poses, however, the committee authorized its chairman to establish
a subcommittee which, with representation from the Administra­
tive Office, would consider these matters and confer with the De­
partment of Justice as appropriate. Judge Hastings advised that
he had appointed a subcommittee for this purpose comprised of
Judge Harvey M. Johnsen as Chairman, Judge Wade H. McCree,
Jr., Chief Judge James M. Carter, and Judge Dudley B. BonsaI.
                 RELEASE OF COMMITTEE REPORT

  Upon committee recommendation, the Conference authorized
the immediat& release of the' committee report and directed the
Administrative Office to 'distribute copies to all members of the
Federal judiciary for information.

       ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law, Circuit Judge George C. Edwards, Jr., presented
the report of the committee.
                    FEDERAL MAGISTRATES      ACT
   S. 3475, 89th Congress, would abolish the office of U.S. commis­
sioner and in place thereof would establish within the judicial
branch of the Government the offices of full-time and part-time
U.S. magistrates. Judge Edwards reported that the proposed
legislation was first examined by a subcommittee created to study
the U.S. commissioner system and subsequently the bill and the
comments of the subcommittee were reviewed and considered by
the full committee. Judge Edwards reported that the committee
approved the major principles of the bill, namely, the proposed
upgrading of the status of the present system of U.S. commissioners
and the more efficient utilization of them through the transfer,
where feasible, of appropriate items for trial or disposition to
relieve the workload of district courts. The committee had several
recommendations for amendments of the bill, all of which had             (
been discussed with Senator Tydings, who introduced the bill, and
members of his staff. All differences had been reconciled Judge
Edwards reported with the exception of proposed changes in sec­
tion 636 relating to the delegation of duties of the magistrates and
section 3401 concerning the minor offense jurisdiction proposed
for the magistrates. The Conference authorized the chairman of
the committee to confer further with the chairman and members
of the staff of the Senate Subcommittee on the Improvements in
Judicial Machinery concerning the differences between the com­
mittee and the Senate subcommittee in these two areas and re­
quested him to report back to the Conference at its next meeting.
                           BAIL JUMPING

   The Conference considered H.R. 12442 and S. 2855, bills pre­
scribing procedure for the return of persons who have fled in viola­
tion of the conditions of bail given in any State or judicial district
of the United States to another State or judicial district. The
Conference noted the views of the committee that insofar as the
bills relate to State bail jumpers, they may infringe on extradition     C/
                                 55 

procedures and that the bills do not specify the manner in which
a bail jumper, after issuance of a removal warrant, would be re­
turned to the appropriate jurisdiction. The Conference voted its
disapproval of these bills as drafted.
                ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES

  Judge Edwards rePQrted that the committee had given further
study to S. 2722 and H.R. 14343 providing for appellate review
of sentences in criminal cases arising in the district courts of
the United States. The Conference requested the committee to
study these bills further and to make a recommendation to the
Conference on this subject at its next meeting.
                            IMMUNITY

  The Conference approved S. 2190, a bill which would provide
that on approval of the Attorney General or a designated assistant
attorney general immunity could be granted to a witness compelled
to testify before a grand jury or U.S. court involving a violation of
18 U.S.C. 1952, proscribing interstate or foreign travel or trans­
portation in aid of racketeering enterprises.
CoMMITMENT OF PERSONS ACQUITTED ON THE GROUND OF INSANI'l'Y

   Judge Edwards advised the Conference that the committee had
considered S. 3689 and S. 3753, both bills which while varying in
specific details would empower a district court on the acquittal of
a defendant solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of
the commission of a Federal offense to hold commitment proceed­
ings to determine on the basis of examination and hearing whether
the release of such person would constitute a danger to himself
and others and whether he should be committed to the custody of
a designated Federal officer for institutional treatment. The Con­
ference approved these bills, in principle, but directed that the
committee make a more detailed study of the specific provisions
and to that end instructed the Administrative Office to obtain
background material and other data to assist the committee in its
continuing stUdy.

          COMMISSION ON REFORM OF CRIMINAL            LAws
   H.R.15766 and H.R. 16206 are bills proposing the establishment
of a national commission to make a complete review of the statutory
and case law of the United States for the purpose of formulating and
recommending to the Congress legislation to improve the Federal
system of criminal justice and to make recommendations for re­
vision and recodification of the criminal laws of the United States,
including the repeal of unnecessary or undesirable statutes and
such changes in the official structure as will better serve the ends
of justice. Upon committee recommendation, the Conference ap­
proved the principle of these bills but suggested that they be
amended to include specific provision for the study of all criminal
penalties in the laws of the United States for the purpose of deter­
mining those which might be appropriately reduced to the grade
of "petty offenses," as defined in Section 1 of Title 18, United States
Code.
                        OTHER LEGISLATION

   The Conference considered and voted to disapprove the following
items of legislation:
   1. S. 3350, a bill which would provide that the power of the
                                                                          (
district courts under 18 U.S.C. 402 relating to contempts constitut­
ingcrimes shall not be vacated, reviewed, restricted or restrained
by the courts of appeals except upon an appeal from a final order
or judgment of commitment entered by the district courts.
   2. S. 2578, a bill which provides that no confession made while
the defendant is in custody or other detention shall be inadmissible
solely because of delay in bringing such defendant before a judicia]
officer.
   3. H.R. 8373, a bill to provide amnesty for first offenders under
federal criminal law. The Conference agreed that the committee
should continue to study the general problem to which this bill
is addressed.
   4. S. 962, a bill which would authorize the appeal of a criminal
conviction of a tribal court to the U.S. district court on a claim
of deprivation of a constitutional right; on the filing of such appeal
from a tribal court, the district court would try the case de novo.
   As to one item of legislation, the Conference agreed that it
involved a matter of public policy exclusively within the compe­
tence of Congress. This was H.R. 14887, a bill which would                (
                                 57 


establish a commission empowered to order the payment of com­
pensation to a person injured as a result of an act or omission of
another person which is a felony under State or Federal law.
           OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
   Circuit Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Committee Chairman, re­
ported on the first meeting of this recently-reactivated Committee
on the Operation of the Jury System.
   Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that this committee has
reviewed the numerous legislative proposals relating to jury selec­
tion and that he had appointed a subcommittee to study the
mechanics of the several proposals which relate both to Federal
and State methods of selection. The Conference approved this
action, and on recommendation of the committee, endorsed the
principle of random selection of jurors in a manner that would
produce a fair cross section of the community in the district or
division in which court is held. The Conference also approved the
committee recommendation that district judges consider reevalua­
tion of present methods of jury selection in the light of recent
judicial decisions.
   Judge Kaufman also reported that the committee had observed
that in recent months considerable interest had been generated in
the possible use of data computers for court administration and
for predicting with greater accuracy the jury requirements of par­
ticular courts. The Conference authorized the chairman to coop­
erate with the Institute of Judicial Administration in a study of
the possible use of data computers for court administration, spe­
cifically including a pilot study of the possibility of the use of
computers for the administration of the jury system in order to
achieve a more accurate prediction of jury requirements and to
reduce costs.
   The Conference approved further committee study of the neces­
sity of promUlgating guidelines or taking other corrective .action to
shield Federal juries from prejudicial publicity in the light of the
Supreme Court's decision in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333.
   The Conference also approved committee stUdy of the possible
statutory conflicts which might result from the Supreme Court's
opinion in CheD v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, and a study of
draft amendments to the contempt statute and, if necessary, coop­
                                 58
eration with the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of
Criminal Prooedure.

   ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman of the Committee on
the Administration of the Probation System, presented the com­
mittee's report to the Conference.

                     SENTENCING INSTITUTES

  The Conference approved the holding of a sentencing institute
in the Second Circuit in New York City and Danbury, Conn., on
November 10 and 11, 1966, as well as the agenda for the meeting.
  Judge Hoffman advised the Conference that tentative plans
have been drawn for a sentencing institute for the judges of the
Fourth and Fifth Circuits at Atlanta, Ga., in the fall of 1967.
                   WORKLOAD MEASUREMENTS

   Judge Hoffman reported that the committee had received a
memorandum outlining in a preliminary way a proposal for con­
sideration by the committee and the Administrative Office for
                                                                       (
study of workloads of probation officers. The Conference ex­
pressed the view that such a study should await the report of the
National Crime Commission.
            STUDY OF STATE AND FEDERAL SYSTEMS

   At the March 1966 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 15),
the committee reported it had received a tentative proposal from
the dean of the School of Criminology of the University of Cali­
fornia for a study of probation systems and administration gener­
ally in the Federal and State governments. Judge Hoffman
reported that the committee had concluded that such a study should         J
not be pursued at this time.
                 SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
  Chief Judge Theodore Levin, Chairman of the committee, pre­
sented the report of the Committee on Supporting Personnel.

                                                                       (
                                  59
                          CLERKS' OFFICES

  The Conference approved the request for 68 additional personnel
for the clerks' offices and also approved the recommendation that
should the fiscal year 1967 request for 41 additional persons be
reduced by the Congress, the deficiency be added to the 1968
appropriation request. Included in the new request are personnel
for the new Southern District of California.

                            INTERPRETERS

   Judge Levin reported a request for a full-time interpreter for
the District Court of Puerto Rico. Judge Aldrich, in reporting
that the request had the full approval of the Judicial Council of
the First Circuit, stated that an interpreter is required in more
than 90 percent of the cases in the District Court of Puerto Rico.
The Conference authorized the employment of a full-time inter­
preter for this court at a salary to be fixed by the Director of the
Administrative Office.
  Judge Levin reported that a request for consideration of the need
of a full-time interpreter had been received for the District Court
for the Western District of Texas, particularly at San Antonio,
EI Paso, and Del Rio. The Conference was of the view that ade­
quate provision has already been made for the employment of
interpreters in this district on a case-by-case basis.
                 SALARIES OF COURTROOM CLERKS

   The Conference agreed with the committee's conclusion that the
rank of grades of courtroom clerks up to JSP-12 has created a
marked imbalance in the structure of the Judiciary Salary Plan and,
accordingly, agreed with the committee recommendation that a
more appropriate method of classification of courtroom clerk posi­
tions would be to reconstitute two compensation categories, with
grade ranges of:
     First Category: JSP-8; JSP-9; JSP-l0 

     Second Category: JSP-9; JSP-l0; JSP-ll 

The first and lower category would be for those positions having
little or minor calendar responsibilities. The second and higher
category would be for those positions having complete calendar
responsibilities.
                                 60 

  The Conierence agreed further that no incumbent should be
reduced in grade as a result of the Conference action for reclassifi­
cation of grades unless such a reduction is desired by the court in
which the individual is currently serving.
                 SECRETARIES-CoURT OF CLAIMS

   The Conference approved the qualification standards proposed
by the Chief Judge of the Court of Claims for the position of secre­
tary to the Chief Commissioner who performs not only duties as
a secretary but also as an administrative assistant for all of the
commissioners of the court. The Conference approved the grade
classification of JSP-IO for this position.
   The Conference also agreed that the qualification and entrance
standards for secretaries to the commissioners be modified to con­
form basically to the standards established for secretaries to U.S.
circuit and district judges.
                      SECRETARIES TO JUDGES

   Judge Levin reported that the committee had again given fun
consideration to permit higher salaries for secretaries to judges and
it again concluded that it should make no recommendation at this        (
time for increasing the salaries of secretaries. At the same time
the committee recommended and the Conference approved re­
affirming its position that legislation should be adopted to bring
the retirement benefits of judges' secretaries to the same level as
those of secretaries to the members of Congress. The Conference
endorsed R.R. 10263 now pending in the 89th Congress which
would carry out this purpose.
                         COURT REPORTERS

  The Conference approved the committee recommendation that
the present rate for Federal court reporters be increased from 65
cents to 90 cents per page for original copy and the rate of original
daily copy be increased from $1.30 per page to $1.50 per page, and
with additional rate per page for daily transCript as follows:

 NOTE.-For an original and more than 6 copies: $1.00 faT original and $0.35 {or each eopy.


   The Conference approved the committee recommendation that
the request on behalf of the U.S. District Court and the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia for an increase in salaries
of court reporters to $15,000 per annum and for five additional
court reporters for the District Court of the District of Columbia
not be granted.
   The Conference agreed with the present practice of the Admin­
istrative Office in publishing the earning figures of reporters for
the use of judges and denied the request of the Court Reporters
Association that the earning figures be held only for the confiden­
tial use of the Administrative Office and the Judicial Conference.

                                    MESSENGER-LAW CLERKS

   The Conference approved the recommendation of the committee
to defer the request from the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit for introduction of a bill to provide for the combination
position of messenger-law clerk until such time as the Congress
takes action on the current appropriation request for 33 staff law
clerks and necessary additional stenographers for courts of appeals.
                INTERCHANGE OF FEDERAL-STATE PERSONNEL

   In regard to the Bureau of the Budget request for views on
proposed legislation which would permit temporary interchanges
of personnel between Federal and State governments, the Con­
ference authorized the Director of the Administrative Office to
advise the Bureau of the Budget that while this interchange would
no doubt be of great value in those areas where counterparts can
be found within the Federal and State governments, it is unable
                                62 

to find appropriate counterparts between Federal and State
judiciary.
             EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
   The Conference noted the memorandum from the Director of
the Administrative Office to all members of his staff advising of
the national policy in favor of a positive program for equal oppor­
tunity of employment. The Conference in endorsing this policy
directed that appropriate notice thereof be sent to each Federal
judge and to each clerk of court.

                   COURT REPORTER-SECRETARY
  The Conference noted and disapproved a request that indi­
viduals serving in the combination position of court reporter­
secretary be given an increase in salary which would amount to
1% to 1% of their present salaries. The committee noted that
there are only three such combination positions now remaining in
continental United States.

           TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE
   Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Committee on         (
Trial Practice and Technique, presented the report of the
committee.
   Judge Murrah pointed out that the committee had previously
called attention of the Conference to the fact that only a small
percentage of civil cases normally reached the trial stage. As a
result, the committee has been continuing to explore methods of
identifying well in advance of trial those cases which are likely
to be settled or disposed of short of trial. Judge Murrah stated
that the committee is of the view that such cases can be identified
at an early stage and can be placed on an accelerated calendar
for prompt disposal. He advised that the committee members
have agreed to undertake an innovative use of an accelerated cal­
endar in their own courts.
   The committee also recommended that an approach· to the
development of techniques for the judicial management of civil
litigation should be undertaken on a broad front and that this
could best be done through circuit committees on trial practice
and technique. The Conference approved a resolution that such
circuit committees be appointed by the chief judges in circuits       l_~
                                  63 

where they do not exist and where they do exist that these com­
mittees be revitalized and reactivated. The Conference further
approved the resolution that each such circuit committee be com­
posed of, but not limited to, at least one district judge and one
attorney from each State in the circuit, that the member of the
Judicial Conference committee from the particular circuit be a
member, ex officio, of the circuit committee and that the circuit
committee should study the problem of civil dockets and backlogs
and with the help and assistance of the Judicial Conference Com­
mittee on Trial Practice and Technique, seek the cooperation of
and offer assistance to district judges and courts in making realistic
attacks on the backlog problem by the use of an accelerated
calendar.
   The resolution, as approved by the Conference, further provides
that the Administrative Office make available, on request, from
its IBM processing machine lists all pending civil cases, showing
docket number, name of the case, date filed, and type of case by
code number.
   The Conference also approved the committee recommendation
that a subcommittee of the Conference committee be appointed
consisting of one judge from a multiple court district with more
than eight judges which uses the master calendar in civil cases,
one judge from a multiple court district of more than eight judges
which uses an individual assignment calendar in civil cases, one
judge from a court of from four to eight judges and one judge from
a court of three or less judges to study and promulgate proposed
methods and techniques for the use of an accelerated calendar in
conneotion with oases deemed appropriate.
           SuaCOMMI'l."TEE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION

  Judge Edwin A. Robson, a member of the subcommittee
appointed to consider discovery problems arising, in multiple liti­
gation with common witnesses and exhibits, advised the Conference
that the antitrust proceedings in the electrical equipment industry
had been reduced to 67 cases. The Conference was advised of
progress made in other areas of litigation, such as Aluminum Cable
and Rock Salt proceedings.
  Judge Robson advised the Conference that he and other mem­
bers of the subcommittee had testified before the House Judiciary
Committee on H.R. 8276, 89th Congress, a bill previously approved
                                     64 


by the Conference at its March 1965 session (Conf. Rept., p. 12)                  ('_"
and that hearings were scheduled in October before the Subcom­
mittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   Judge Robson next presented to the Conference the text of an
outline of suggested procedures and materials for pretrial and
trial of complex and multiple litigation. The Conference approved
the subcommittee recommendation that the text be submitted to
all Federal judges for comment, ideas and suggestions. Judge
Robson advised that a special drafting subcommittee has been
appointed from the committee membership to review and consider
the comments, ideas and suggestions which are received, after which
a further report will be made to the Conference.

                          HABEAS CORPUS
   Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
Habeas Corpus, advised the Conference that the proposed amend­
ment to Section 2241 of Title 28, United States Code, approved
by the Conference at its September 1965 session (Conf. Rept ..
p. 84), had passed the House of Representatives on Septem- (",
ber 6, H}66 and was now pending before the Senate Judiciary
Committee. The Conference reaffirmed its support of the revised
bill approved by the September 1965 session of the Conference,
as passed by the House of Representatives.
                             RESOLUTION
  On motion of Chief Judge Paul C. Weick who noted the absence
because of illness of Senior Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the
Conference Committee on Court Administration, the Conference
adopted the following resolution;
     RESOLVED, that the members of the Judicial Conference of the United
   States express their deep appreciation to Honorable John Biggs, Jr., for the
   outstanding service he has rendered to the Conference over a period of
   many yeaTS and for his great contribution to the administration of justice.
     The members of the Conference also extend their best wishes for Judge
   Biggs' speedy recovery and hope he will SOQIl be able to resume his active
   participation in the affairs of the Conference. His good companionship and
   sound advice are missed by everybody.

  PRETERMISSION OF THE TERMS OF COURTS OF
                  APPEALS
  At the request of Chief Judge Charles J. Vogel, the Conference,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that the terms of the Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis
be pretermitted during the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1967.

            RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
   The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
on matters considered at this session where necessary for legis­
