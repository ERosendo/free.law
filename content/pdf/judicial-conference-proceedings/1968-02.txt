               FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER
  Mr. Justice Clark, United States Supreme Court, (retired), pre­
sented to the Conference the report of the ad hoc Committee on
the Federal Judicial Center which had been appointed by the Chief
Justice with instructions to report to the Conference at this meet­
ing. Mr. Justice Clark stated that within a week of the signing by
                                       3

      the President of the bill establishing the Federal Judicial Center
(	    on December 20, 1967, the Chief Justice had appointed the ad hoc
      Committee, consisting of judges, practicing lawyers and law pro­
     fessors, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Clark, and had
      charged it with assisting in the implementation of the Federal
     Judicial Center Act as quickly as possible.
        Mr. Justice Clark advised that the Committee was of the view
      that the most important immediate task was the selection by the
     Judicial Conference of the members of the Board of the Center.
     The Committee recommended that the Chief Justice, as permanent
     Chairman of the Board of the Center as well as Chainnan of the
     Judicial Conference, appoint a committee prior to the convening
     of the Conference on February 27 to consider and evaluate mem­
     bers of the federal judiciary who might be best suited to carry
     out the duties of the Board. The Committee recommended that
     such Board members should be considered for selection based on
     their broad knowledge of judicial functions, their experience in
     educational and research programs, their ability to deal construc­
     tively with the problems facing the federal judicial system and with
     due regard for relevant geographical considerations. The Chief
     Justice in late January appointed a committee consisting of five
(    members of the Judicial Conference, under the Chairmanship of
     Chief Judge Paul C. Weick, to conduct this screening process. At
     the same time he advised all federal judges of the appointment of
     this committee and invited nominations for membership on the
     Board.
        Chief Judge Weick then advised the Conference that his com­
     mittee had screened some 9'1 nominations and examined the avail­
     able information on each of those who were eligible for appoint­
     ment. The committee was impressed with the universally high
     quality of all the judges recommended and presented to the Con­
     ference the following nominations-Circuit Judges Wade H.
     McCree, Jr., and James M. Carter and District Judges Edward J.
     Devitt, William A. McRae, Jr., and Harold R. Tyler, Jr. The Con­
     ference immediately approved these five nominees who were duly
     elected to constitute the first Board of the Federal Judicial Center.
     Judge McCree was designated for the one year tenn, Judge McRae
     for the two year term, Judges Carter and Devitt for three years
     and Judge Tyler for four.
        Judge Weick then advised the Conference that because of the
(         295-457r-68----2
                                  4

large number of well-qualified judges whose nominations were
considered by his screening committee, the committee had decided
to present to the Federal Judicial Center a recommendation of one
judge from each judicial circuit who might well serve on one of the
advisory committees of the Center as recommended by the ad hoc
Committee. These were Judge McGowan-District of O:>lumbia
Circuit, Judge Murray-First Circuit, Judge Kaufman-Second
Circuit, Judge Higginbotham-Third Circuit, Judge Stanley­
Fourth Circuit, Judge Bell-Fifth Circuit, Judge Wilson-Sixth
Circuit, Judge Will-Seventh Circuit, Judge Blackmun-Eighth
Circuit, Judge Boldt-Ninth Circuit, and Judge Breitenstein­
Tenth Circuit.
   Mr. Justice Clark then summarized the main conclusions of the
ad hoc O:>mmittee. He stated that the operation of the Center
broke down into three main categories-(l) the education and
training of personnel of the courts; (2) research; and (3) systems
analysis, the utilization of which the Center is specifically charged
by the Act. He stated that the O:>mmittee was in full agreement
that the Administrative Office and the Center must work closely
together, that their offices should be contiguous as nearly as possible
and that the Center must draw upon the Administrative Office for
assistance, particularly in the area of statistics. The O:>mmittee, he
stated, was of the view that the Center would conduct or direct
such in depth research as has hitherto been unavailable to the
judiciary, The Administrative Office will continue to conduct
studies in implementation of the work of the Judicial O:>nference
and its committees. He stated that the O:>mmittee was enthusiastic
over the potential of the computer in judicial administration but
he pointed to the need for programming experts to determine what
can be done, particularly toward relieving the court congestion. He
said that the O:>mmittee was of the view that the circuit council
and circuit conferences must also be utilized to assist the Center in
its work.
   TheO:>mmittee made further specific recommendations con­
cerning the types of persons needed as Director and as officers of
the professional staff of the Center. It recommended the establish­
ment of four advisory .committees to assist the Director and his
staff (1) in formulating and executing research projects and deter­
mining their relative priority, (2) to advise on the conduct of pro­
gramming of continuing education, (3) on the use of systems analy­
                                           5

    sis and innovation, and (4) on oversight for the purpose of evalu­
(   ating the work of the Center in its over-all operations.
       The Committee also recommended that the Center should con­
    duct research through arrangements with private and public insti­
    tutions as well as through staff efforts, with the decision as to
    method properly left as a function of the Director. It recommended
    that the education and research programs should generally be pat­
    terned after the National College of State Trial Judges but should
    not be restricted to newly appointed judges. It recommended that
    the three seminars planned for federal judges in 1968 should pro­
    ceed under the direction of the Judicial Conference Committee on
    Trial Practice and Technique, with the Center participating fully,
    using the seminars as a laboratory for expanding activity.
       The Committee recommended that at the earliest possible date
    the Center should develop a national library, including a complete
    library service on judicial administration.
       It recommended further that the Administrative Office, in an­
    ticipation of the needs of the Center, should immediately begin
    a tentative program for the expanded use of the computer in
    court administration.
       The Conference voted complete approval of the reports of the
    Committees chaired by Mr. Justice Clark and Chief Judge Weick
    and authorized their immediate release.
                      JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
       Chief Judge William J. Campbell, Chairman of the Committee
    on the Budget, reported that hearings were held by the Subcom­
    mittee of the House Appropriations Committee on the judiciary
    appropriation bill for fiscal year 1968 on February 14, 1968. Judge
    Campbell stated that he was accompanied at the hearings by Chief
    Judge Alfred P. Murrah, also a member of the Budget Committee,
    who advised on the need for additional law clerks and other sup­
    porting personnel for the courts of appeals. On behalf of the
    Budget Committee and of Chief Judge Chambers of the Ninth
    Circuit, Judge Campbell then presented to the Conference the
    following resolution which was unanimously approved.
       That the dollar limitation stated 'in the annual appropriation acts be raised
       to permit a chief judge of a circuit to hire two secretaries in Grade 10
       and a law clerk in Grade 11 and, if funds are appropriated for a second
       law clerk for each circuit judge, the limitation further be raised to
       accommodate the salary of such law clerk in Grade 9.

                    JUDICIAL STATISTICS
  The report of the Committee on Judicial Statistics was presented (
by the Chairman of the Committee, Senior Judge Harvey M.
Johnsen.
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

    Judge Johnsen stated that a number of express requests had been
received by the Committee since its last report to the Conference,
asking it to make some emergency recommendations for additional
judgeships, both circuit and district, for approval by the Confer-               I
ence and transmittal to the Congress for action during calendar             j
year 1968. Judge Johnsen stated that pursuant to the action of the
Conference at its March 1967 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 9),
a bill was now pending in the House of Representatives, having
already passed the Senate, providing for certain additional circuit
judgeships. He stated that several additional bills had also been
introduced and were pending in the Congress but had not yet
received Conference action relating to additional circuit and district
judgeships.
    The Committee, Judge Johnsen reported, canvassed and studied
carefully the statistical data of all of these proposals. It concluded (.
that none of them was so critical as to call upon it to recommend
that Congress be asked to take any such emergency action during
the remaining months of the 1968 legislative session, except for
the proposals which emanated from the Conference as to certain
circuit judgeships at the March 1967 session. He said that a
number of practical considerations entered into the Committee's
judgment not to recommend that further judgeships be sought in
 t.he 1968 session. Among other things, the Committee was of the
opinion that any emergency judgeship bill at the present time
might only tend to disrupt and perhaps even nullify the organized
 program for making requests for additional judgeships in which
                                                                            I
 the Committee has sought to engage and to which it believes Con-           '<

gress has given some indication of acceptance. He advised further
 that the Committee is planning at its 1968 summer meeting to en­
gage in another complete study and survey of all the district courts
 and make recommendations on the basis thereof as to the apparent
 need for additional judgeships at the September 1968 session of the
 Conference. Such approvals as may be made by the Conference at
 that time may then be made the subject of an omnibus bill for
                                            7

     introduction at the new session of Congress in January 1969. He
     said that the survey w be made by the Committee at its next meet­
     ing will consist of a full comparative study of the statistics of the
     district courts during the past seven to ten years and will be forti­
     fied by such field work on the part of the Division of Procedural
     Studies and Statistics of the Administrative Office as seems neces­
     sary or desirable in order w penetrate the aspects of some local
     situations.
        The Conference, after a discussion of this portion of Judge John­
     sen's report, voted its approval thereof.
                                    FORM     J.S. 	10
       Judge Johnsen stated that his. Committee had considered a
     report of its subcommittee charged with attempting to obtain a
     more realistic reflection of judicial csooloads than is afforded by
     Form J.S. 10.
       After consideration of the subcommittee report, the Committee
     recommended to the Conference:
       (1) 	Oontinulan>ce Qf the use CJf Form J.S. 10 as a Stlandiml report but with
           further study Ito be nutde o.f whel!her pretrial (!o.nferen(!es ,should be
           separately liSted o.r merely shown in their total as is now pro.vided ;
(	     (2) Approval of the preparatio.n and publication of a new table to be kno.wn
            as Table X-2 intended to give an 'Over-all indicatio.n Qf the pro.ductivity
           of the district co.urts in terms o.f cases actually terminated rather than
           putting emphasis merely o.n trials. As to civil case terminatio.ns, the
           table will contain a column sho.wing the terminations occurring without
            any court action; one showing terminatio.ns from a court action in the
           form of "motions, hearings and submissions," Qne sho.wing the terminations
            "incident to a pretrial conference" and columns showing the terminations
           by trial, jury and n'On-jury. As to criminal case terminatio.ns, the table
           will show those terminated (a) by dismissal, (b) on plea, and (c) o.n trial
           by jury Qr by the Co.urt ;
       (8) 	The Committ:e requested the Administrative 01Hce to explore the use Qf
           a separate type report by judges reguIarIyasslgned to duties not involved
            in the trial of cases and to report to the Committee thereon at an early
           date;
       (4) 	The Committee requested the Administrative 01Hce to notify all district
           judges as to ·the action taken by the Judicial Conference on these
            recommendatio.ns.
       The Conference approved all of the foregoing recommendations,
     together with a separate suggestion made by Judge Harper that
     the clerks of the district courts be directed to add at the bottom of
     each J .S. 10 report, on one line, the following item:
        "Arraignments, motio.ns and sentencing in criminal cases; motions in civil
(       cases; and naturalization"
                                   8

and next to this item to insert the total court time in hours and
minutes spent on these matters during the month and in paren­
thesis thereafter insert the number of days actually involved in this
activity; further, with respect to the new Table X-2, that there be
added under the heading Criminal Cases, a column showing "mo­
tions, hearings and submissions."

                  STATISTICS ON CRIMINAL CASES

  The Conference noted its approval of the action of the Commit­
tee in requesting the Division of Procedural Studies and Statistics
to make special indication in its statistical reports of criminal cases
which have been pending more than a year with the reasons therefor
and data as to those involving fugitives, persons in custody or
persons in military service.
    REPORT OF "CASES HEARD OR SUBMITTED" IN THE COURTS OF
                              ApPEALS

    The Conference noted its approval of the action of the Commit­
tee in reaffirming its approval of the procedures and definitions
currently used in classifying cases "heard or submitted." The
Committee noted that there had been some practice of writing and
filing memoranda in cases which are not actually heard or sub­
mitted and then showing and reporting these as such cases. In the
interest of uniformity as to statistical information, the Committee
indicated that such cases should not be reported as heard or sub­
mitted. The fact that memoranda are written in such cases does not
entitle them to be included in the tables showing "opinions written
in cases which are heard or submitted."
                   DOCKETING OF CRoss-ApPEALS

  In its report to the Conference, the Committee pointed out that
on its recommendation the Conference had previously approved
that cross~appeals be separately docketed as a matter of securing
uniformity in practice and statistical portrayal among the courts
of appeals.
  Experience, however, has shown that the use of sub,..classification
numbers, as for example 2000--A, 200a-B, etc., complicates the
computer processing of the Administrative Office. The Committee,
therefore, recommended and the Conference approved that in the (
                                      9

    future each cross-appeal will be given a separate docket number in
    every circuit and a separate docket sheet will be opened on each
    such appeal. Further, in respect to clerical processing, docket
    entries may be made only in the principal case with an appropriate
    cross reference on the other sheets so that all documents can be kept
    in one file and the impact on the workload of the clerk's office as a
    result of additional docketing will be kept to a minimum.

                      COURT ADMINISTRATION

      The report of the Committee on Court AdministratIOn was
    presented by its Chairman, Senior Judge John Biggs, Jr.

                     JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT

       The Committee reported that, pursuant to Conference authoriza­
    tion at its March 1967 session (Conf. Rept., p. 15), it has been
    preparing a revision of the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act to bring
    its provisions into line with provisions of the Civil Service Retire­
    ment Act relating to members of Congress.
       The Committee noted, however, that there is now pending in
(   the Congress a bill, n.R. 10012, which would make important
    changes in respect to the financing of the Civil Service Retirement
    Act relating to members of Congress and would provide financing
    which, if it could be employed, would be of advantage to judges'
    survivors.
       The Conference agreed that it would be advantageous to defer
    the approval of any amendments to the Judicial Survivors Annuity
    Act until the proposed new financing provisions of the Civil Service
    Retirement Act have been determined. It was likewise decided
    to defer the question of whether it would be desirable to merge the
    Judicial Survivors Annuity Fund with the Civil Service Retire:­
    ment Fund, assuming that the Administrative Office would con­
    tinue to ~nister the Judicial Survivors. Annuity Fund.
       The Conference approv~ n.R. 9391 which would amend Sec­
    tion 376(a), Title 28, United S4ttes Code, by striking out.I'or within
    six months after the enactment of this section" and inserting in
    lieu thereof "or within six months after he marries or within six
    months after the enactment of this amendment." The Conference
    noted that this proposed bill would permit a judge who was -not
    married on his accession to the judiciary but who was married after
                                10
the expiration of six months to avail himself of the benefits of the
Judicial Survivors Annuity Act.

                      ADDITION AL JUDGESHIPS

   The Conference noted that the Committee on Court Administra­
tion had also received several requests for recommendation for
additional district and circuit judgeships. The Committee on Court
Administration and the Committee on Judicial Statistics are both
prepared to devote close study to this problem at their summer
meetings in 1968 in order to prepare recommendations for the
Conference in September. Judge Biggs advised that his Committee,
therefore, was making no recommendations for Conference action
at this time and the Conference concurred in this recommendation.

                REALIGNMENT OF TEXAS DmSloNS

   The Conference approved the recommendation of the Committee
to endorse H.R. 11950 and S. 2286 which would include Panola and
Shelby Counties within the Marshall Division of the Eastern Dis­
trict of Texas. These counties would be withdrawn from the Tyler
Division of the Eastern District of Texas. Court would be held         (.
at Marshall, with a population of more than 23,000 persons. The
Conference noted that the bill had previously been approved by the
Judicial Council of the the Fifth Circuit.

  DEFENDANTS AT LARGE AFTER AFFIRMANCE OF CONVICTION

   Judge Biggs advised the Conference that at the March 1967
meeting he had reported that his Committee had studied the
problems raised by Senator Robert C. Byrd concerning defendants
who had been released and were at large after affirmance of con~            .,
viction (Conf. Rept., p. 16), The Conference at that time agreed             I
that the responsibility in such a situation rests upon the prosecu­
tion and had requested the Department of Justice to make an
examination of its records to ascertain that no defendant remains
at large whose conviction has been finally affirmed on appellate
review.
   Judge Biggs noted that the Administrative Office is now in re­
ceipt of a letter from Assistant Attorney General Vinson, in charge
of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, reporting
that all criminal cases in the District of Columbia had been re-       (,
                                    11 


    viewed for the past seventeen years to insure that no person is at
    liberty who should be incarcerated and that careful procedures
    have been set up in the District of Columbia whereby the Clerk
    of the District Court will maintain a list of cases in which bond
    pending appeal has been taken.
       Mr. Vinson noted further that if commitment is not required
    by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia pending the
    disposition of application for certiorari, the Clerk of the Supreme
    Court will forward a copy of any order entered by the Supreme
    Court directly to the Clerk of the District Court.
       In addition, Mr. Vinson stated that the appellate section of
    the Criminal Division has established a procedure for notifying
    each individual United States Attorney of every action taken by
    the Supreme Court.
       Judge Biggs reported, further, that on November 30, 1967 Mr.
    Vinson wrote to report that the Department of Justice had com­
    pleted its study of the practices of the United States Attorneys
    with regard to commitment of defendants after termination of
    appeals, petitions for certiorari, denials of bail pending appeal or
    revocation of bail and has requested each United StateB Attorney
    to review the procedures of his office to preclude the possibility
(   of error.
                               LEGISLATION

      Judge Biggs reported Committee action on several bills and the
    Conference took action as noted:
       1. The Conference referred for further study H.R 13584 and
    other bills similar in tenor which would establish a National
    Foundation of Law.
      2. The Conference disapproved H.R. 13017 which would provide
    for five additional commissioners for the Court of Claims.
      3. The Conference approved S. 1704 which would authorize the
    Court of Claims to implement its judgments as can United States
    district courts under the Tucker Act. The Conference approved the
    Committee recommendation, however, that this approval was con­
    tingent on an amendment in the next to the last line of the pro­
    posed bill by inserting the words "against the United States" after
    the word "cases."
      4. The Committee advised the Conference that the Conference's
    views had been requested as to S. 2020, S. 2690, H.R. 11164 and
(        295-457--68----8
                                 12 


H.R. 11213, to authorize the Court of Claims to hear and render
judgments in claims asserted by or relating to the Indians, Eskimos     (
and the Aleuts of Alaska in respect to the lands in Alaska. Judge
Biggs advised that the Department of the Interior and the Secre­
tary of the Interior have taken no definitive position and that hear­
ings are in the process of being held in Alaska on this subject
matter. The Conference agreed that the time is not ripe for any
recommendation with respect to any of these bills by the
Conference.
   5. The Conference agreed that absent a definitive expression
from the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit
or by its Judicial Council, no action should be taken at this time
in regard to S. 1982 which would provide that the Judicial Council
of the District of Columbia Circuit be authorized to make orders
for all courts established or continuing in the District of Columbia
and which would provide that the Chief Judge of the District of
Columbia Court of General Sessions, the Chief Judge of the District
of Columbia Court of Appeals and the Chief Judge of the Juvenile
Court of the District of Columbia shall be summoned annually to
attend the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit
in order to participate in the business of such Judicial Conference     (
pertaining to their respective courts.
   6. Judge Biggs reported that the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration, jointly with the Committee on Revision of the Laws, had
considered S. 2307, a bill which would provide machinery for Con­
stitutional conventions for amendments to the Constitution of the
United States, and had agreed that this legislation embodies a
policy matter which should not be the subject of any recommenda­
tion by the Conference. The Conference expressed its agreement
with this action and recommendation.
   7. The Conference approved the joint recommendation of the               '.
Committee on Court Administration and· the Committee on
Revision of the Laws to approve S. 2687 which would provide that
instead of review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission
by three-judge district courts, jurisdiction for review of LC.C.
orders would be placed in the respective United States courts of
appeals, thereby eliminating direct appeal to the Supreme Court
of the United States from orders of the Interstate Commerce Com­
mission. The Conference agreed with a motion by Judge Harper
that the Committee study, in advance, the establishment of rna­
                                      13
     chinery (court reporters, clerks, etc.) to take care of this change
     should the legislation be enacted.
              GEOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION OF THE CoURTS

       Judge Biggs advised the Conference that for some period of time
     the Committee on Court Administration has had on its agenda the
     question of geographical organization of,the United States courts,
     a subject which it regards as of prime importance. The Conference
     agreed to suggest to the Federal Judicial Center that this subject
     might be one for early consideration and study by the Center.
                         LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS

        The Conference discussed the Committee report, which is also a
     subject of concern to the Committee on Supporting Personnel, on
     the need for a study of the libraries existing in the several federal
     courthouses. The Conference agreed that this was primarily an
     administrative problem but one which the Administrative Office
     was not at this time equipped to undertake. The question of the
     salaries of librarians was referred to the Committee on Supporting
     Personnel for further study.
(
                       REVISION OF THE LAWS
       Judge J. Skelly Wright, Chairman of the Committee on Revision
     of the Laws, presented the Committee's report.

                     ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE Aar

        The Conference disapproved S. 2770, a bill to amend and sub­
     stantially revise the Administrative Procedure Act. The Confer·
     ence was agreed that this legislative proposal would impose a sub­
     stantially increased burden on the federal courts. The Conference
     noted, further, that the Administrative Conference of the United
     States has now been activated and apparently will undertake a
     formal study of the need for reform of the Administrative Pro- ,
     cedureAct.
                      REVISION OF THE PATENT LAWS

       Judge Wright advised the Conference that the Committee had
     studied S. 1042 and H.R. 5924, companion bills which embody the
\
     recommendations of the President's Commission on the Patent
\.
                                 14 

System, and S. 2597 and H.R. 13951, companion bills which embody
the recommendations of the Patent Section of the American Bar
Association and the American Patent Law Association. The Con­
ference considered the reports of a subcommittee of the Committee
on the Revision of the Laws on these pending bills and requested
that a further study be made of certain portions thereof and, ac­
cordingly, deferred until its next meeting consideration of the
Committee's recommendations.

                           TAX   CoURT

  The Conference considered the Committee's report on S. 2041
and H.R. 10100, bills which would transfer the Tax Court to Title
28, United States Code, as a Constitutional court. The Conference
noted that the legislation, as drafted, contains many features re­
garded by it as unacceptable and, accordingly, voted its disap­
proval of these legislative proposals in their present form. The
Conference noted that these proposals had been considered jointly
by the Committee on Revision of the Laws and the Committee on
Court Administration.
                         EXPEDITING     ACT
  The Conference noted that the Committee on Revision of the
Laws and the Committee on Court Administration had considered
several proposals pending in the 90th Congress relating to the
amendment or repeal of the Expediting Act (15 U.S.C. 29). The
Conference noted that the views of the Department of Justice
and other interested parties had not yet been obtained and agreed
that these proposals should remain for further study with the two
committees.
                       OrHER LOOISLATION

  1. The Committee expressed its disapproval of S. 1073 and
H.R. 10216, l?il).s concerning attorneys' fees earned processing
                                                                       I
claims before administrative agencies. The Conference noted that
S. 1073, in particular, would substantially increase the workload of
the district courts.
   2. The Conference agreed with the Committee recommendation
that H.R. 13984, a bill to provide that certain costs shall be taxed
against the United States in condemnation actions brought by it,
                                     15
    presented an issue of legislative policy with regard to which the
    Conference should take no action.
       3. The Conference considered H.R. 3084, a bill to amend 28
    U.S.C. 1346 to permit suits against the United States arising out
    of contracts entered into by non-appropriated fund activities of
    or under departments or agencies of the United States. The Con­
    ference agreed that this legislation involves a fiscal policy decision
    primarily addressed to the legislative branch and, accordingly, it
    took no action thereon.
      4. The Conference reaffirmed its endorsement of H.R. 13315,
    a bill to define more precisely the territory included in the two
    judicial districts of Virginia. This bill which carries out a recom­
    mendation of the Conference at its September 1967 session (Conf.
    Rept., p. 66) has already passed the House of Representatives
    and is pending in the Senate.
       5. The Conference approved H.R. 13016, a bill to provide cost
    of living allowances for judicial employees stationed outside the
    continental United States or in Hawaii or Alaska. The Conference
    noted prior approval of similar bills pending in the 89th Congress
    (Conf. Rept., March 1965, pp. 15, 36).
       6. The Conference disapproved H.R. 12659 and H.R. 12993,
(
    similar bills which would abolish the National Relations Board
    and establish in its place a United States Labor Court. Similar
    bills were disapproved by the Conference at its September 1967
    session (Conf. Rept., pp. 67, 68).
          COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND
                     PROCEDURE
      The report of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure
    was presented by its Chairman, Senior Judge Albert B. Maris.
       Judge Maris reported that the Supreme Court has approved
    the Uniform Rules of Procedure for the United States Courts of
    Appeals and these were formally presented to the Congress on
    January 15, 1968. Unless Congress otherwise directs, they will
    go into effect on July 1, 1968. This culminates a long-time goal
    of the Conference to secure uniformity in the federal appellate
    procedure.
       Judge Maris reported that proposals for improvement of the
    rules relating to deposition and discovery in civil cases had been
    circulated to the bench and bar for study and comment in Novem­
                                  16 

ber 1967 with the request that all comments and suggestions be
received no later than January 1, 1969.
   Judge Maris reported further that the Advisory Committee on
Bankruptcy Rules and the Advisory Committee on Rules of Evi­
dence are carrying on intensive work with frequent committee
meetings but that neither committee is yet ready to make a report.
   The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is undertaking a
study of certain phases of criminal procedure, particularly those
relating to preliminary hearings, arraignments and other proceed­
ings prior to triaL
   The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules, he reported, is
planning with the aid of a reporter who it is hoped may be ap­
pointed to begin service on July 1 to give more intensive study
to the practical effect of the new rules as they relate to maritime
litigation. Its work is also proceeding on the proposed amendatory
statute which the Conference has authorized it to prepare.

COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY
                SYSTEM
   Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System.                  "
   Judge Kaufman reported that S. 989, a bill substantially em­
bodying the recommendations of the Judicial Conference to provide
for the random selection of jurors, passed the House of Representa­
tives on February 26, 19681 and that the bill will undoubtedly go
to conference between the two Houses at an early date. The Con­
ference approved the recommendation that, in the event S. 989
becomes law, the Committee be empowered to assist the Adminis­
trative Office in preparing any guidelines or suggestions which may
assist and facilitate the district courts in conforming to the require­
men ts of the new legislation.

                       PREJUDICIAL PUBLICITY

  Judge Kaufman reported that the Conference at its September
1966 session had approved the Committee study of the necessity
of promulgating guidelines or taking other corrective action to
shield federal juries from prejudicial publicity in light of the
Supreme Court decision in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 348 U.S. 333
(Conf. Rept., p. 67). Judge Kaufman reported that the subcom­
                                     17 

    mittee which he had appointed at that time has now made its report
    to the Committee. The subcommittee's report advises that the
    subcommittee had consulted widely, both with representatives of
    the bar and bench as well as with representatives of the communi­
    cations media, and that the guidelines recommended by it stem
    from careful consideration by it after extensive inquiry.
       The Conference agreed to accept the report for study and to cir­
    culate it forthwith to all federal judges and to release it to the
    news media with the request that all comments and suggestions
    be directed to the Administrative Office for the Committee no later
    than July 1, Ul68.
       The Conference expressed the hope that the judicial councils and
    the judicial conferences of the circuits would also give careful con­
    sideration to the report and instructed the Committee to report
    back to the C-onference at its September 1968 session on this subject
    matter.

        COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
       Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, Chairman of the Advisory Committee
    on Intercircuit Assignments, reported on the work of his Committee
(   for the period August 18,1967 to February 9, 1968.
\
       In the period covered by the report, Judge Breitenstein stated
    that the Committee had recommended 34 assignments to be under­
    taken by 31 judges. The Chief Justice has approved all assignments
    recommended by the Committee. The assigned judges include two
    circuit judges, three senior circuit judges, 19 district judges, six
    senior district judges and one senior judge of the Court of Claims.
       Assignments were made to the following courts: 11 to the District
    Court for the District of Columbia; one to the District of Puerto
    Rico; two each to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
    and the Sou thern District of N ew York; one to the Court of Appeals
    for the Third Circuit; one to the District of South Carolina; two to
    the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; four to the Middle Dis­
    trict of Florida; one to the Southern District of Florida; two to the
    Northern District of Georgia; one to the Northern District of
    Illinois; one to the Southern District of California; four to the
    Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and one to the Court of Cus­
    toms and Patent Appeals.
       Judge Breitenstein reminded the Conference that the last two
    reports cover roughly the 12 months from the end of January 1967
                                18 

to the first of February 1968. During that time the Committee ap­
proved 71 assignments, of which 22 have been to courts of appeals;
14 to the District Court for the District of Columbia and nine to
the District of Puerto Rico. The remaining 24 have been scattered
among a number of courts. Of the assigned active judges, 21 have
come from the Ninth Circuit and seven from the Eighth Circuit.
   Judge Breitenstein pointed out that special programs, such as
the one under way in the District of Columbia, put a heavy strain
on the national judgepower available for intercircuit assignments.
He stated also that it was the Committee's view that while some
circuits have furnished valuable help, others from which judges
might be available have not contributed substantially to intercir­
cuit assignments. He stated that his Committee has not undertaken
to evaluate the special programs with a view to determining priori­
ties among simultaneous programs and, without Conference direc­
tion, it would not undertake to do so. He stated also that the Com­
mittee is handicapped because it has no way of knowing in advance
what judges are available and from where. He recommended, there­
fore, that the Conference give consideration to some plan whereby
the Committee will be advised of potential availability of (
judgepower.

             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on Bankruptcy Administration.
   Judge Weinfeld reported that the Committee had considered the
recommendations contained in the survey report of the Director of
the Administrative Office, dated January 26, 1968, for the con­
tinuance of referee positions to become vacant by expiration of
term, for changing two part-time referee positions to a full-time
basis, for an increase in the compensation of one part-time referee,
for changes in arrangements for referees of five districts, and for
the creation of three additional full-time positions and one addi­
tional part-time position. These recommendations, which had been
approved by the district courts and circuit counci'ls concerned,
were, with the following exceptions, approved by the Committee
with a recommendation that they become effective on March 1,
                                              19 

     1968 unless otherwise indicated, subject to the availability of ap­
     propriated funds. The Committee recommended that aetion be
     deferred with respect to the creation of a new full-time referee posi­
     tion in the Eastern District of Missouri, a new part-time position
     in the District of Minnesota, and the change of a part-time position
     to a full-time basis in the District of Oregon and changes in regular
     places of office of the referees at Pendleton and Eugene in the latter
     district. The Committee took this action pending further study of
     the caseload in these districts by the Bankruptcy Division. The
     Conference considered the Committee's report and the recom­
     mendations of the Director, the judicial councils and the district
     judges on the basis of which the Conference took the following
     action relating to referee positions and changes in salaries and
     arrangements :

         regular place of office, territory and places of holding court to remain

   Judge Weinfeld explained that the Committee had recommended
deferring for further study requests for additional referee positions
in the District of Minnesota and the E·astern District of,Missouri
and for a change in the part-time position at Pendleton to a full­
time basis, and for changes in the regular place of office of the
Pendleton and Eugene referees. The Conference approved of all of
the Committee's recommendations except the recommendation re­
lating to the Eastern District of Missouri. On motion of Judge
Harper, the Conference voted its approval of the establishment of
an additional full-time referee position at St. Louis, to become
effective on the same basis as the other positions authorized by
the Conference.
   Judge Weinfeld stated that, with the exception of the part-time
position at Great Falls, Montana, no recommendations had been
made for salary increases because of the enactment of the Postal
Revenue and Federal Salary Act of 1967 which contains a pro­
vision for a Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial
Salaries, which will study, among others, the salaries of referees
in bankruptcy.
                           APPROPRIATIONS

   The Conference noted that estimates of appropriations for the
fiscal year 1969 totaling $13,205,000 are now pending before the
House Appropriations Committee. These estimates include an
increase of $74,000 for salaries of referees and $1,197,000 for ex­
penses of referees' offices; the latter item is largely for additional
clerical personnel needed to handle the growing volume of cases
in referees' offices.
                         NEW CASE FILINGS

    During fiscal year 1967, a total of 208,329 cases was filed in the
bankruptcy courts. During the first six months of fiscal year 1968, a
total of 97,634 was filed, reflecting a decrease of 1.5 percent over the
comparable period of the preceding year. Ordinarily, the heavier
filings occur in the last half of the fiscal year. There are indications
that the number of non-business bankruptcy cases is still increasing,
with a comparable decrease in the number of business cases in re­
lation to the total number filed.

                             LEGISLATION

   The Conference considered Senate Joint Resolution 100, 90th
Congress, introduced by Senator Burdick, which would establish
a commission to be known as the Commission on Bankruptcy Laws
of the United States, to study, analyze, evaluate and recommend
changes to the Bankruptcy Act; to reflect and more adequately
to meet the demands of present technical, financial and commer­
cial activities. The Conference approved, in principle, the creation
of this commission but took the view that the scope of the commis­
sion's functions should be broadened to include study of the basic
philosophy and causes of bankruptcy and possible alternatives to
the present system of bankruptcy administration. The Conference
also recommended that the composition of the Commission should
be patterned after the Commission on Executive, Legislative and
Judicial Salaries established by Public Law 90-206 which provides
for a nine-member commission, three appointed by the President
                                    24 

of the United States and two each by the President of the Senate
and Speaker of the House and by the Chief Justice of the United
States.
                    MA'ITERS UNDER ADVISEMENT

  The Conference noted that of 207 referees reporting for the quar­
ter ending December 31, 1967, 35 referees reported a total of 76
matters held under advisement for 60 days or longer.

           DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER XIII

   The Conference noted the report of the Administrative Office
that in fiscal year 1967 31,963 Chapter XIII cases were filed. This
represents an all-time high and an increase of 13.1 percent above
the Chapter XIII filings of the previous year. The great.est in­
creases were in the Seventh and Ninth Circuit-s. The Conference
was advised that the Bankruptcy Division has noted that some
bankruptcy courts are experiencing difficulty in obtaining meaning­
ful independent audits of Chapter XIII trustees' operations at
reasonable costs to debtors.
   The Conference was advised that a number of referees whose
trustees have between 50 and 200 cases under supervision are still               (
using individual case bank accounts although the guideline, ap­
proved by the Conference at its December 1966 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 49), applicable to all Chapter XIII trustees who have 50
or more wage-earner proceedings requires that the trustee shall
maintain debtor funds in a consolidated bank account. The referees
have reported that their depositories still maintain individual ac­
counts for debtors without additional cost and that this arrange­
ment makes trustees' record-keeping easier and permits the referee
or his clerks to audit each wage-earner's account when his case
is closed. Moreover, it is now possible for Chapter XIII trustees to
obtain the benefits in savings of a blanket bond but still maintain
individual bank accounts for debtors. Accordingly, the Conference
approved the new guideline, modifying the one adopted in Septem­
ber1966,asfollows:
   The trustee shall maintain debtor funds in a consolidated bank account:
   Provided, however, individual bank accounts for debtors may be maintained
   in the discretion of the local bankruptcy court if this can be accomplished
   without increaSing the costs (bank service charges, bond premiums, etc.)
   to debtors.
  The Conference was also advised that the Bankruptcy Division
of the Administrative Office in studying the adequacy and lack
                                     25 

of uniformity in the fixing of Chapter XIII trustees' bonds has
found that many of the existing bonds were in amoun ts less than
10 percent of annual receipts. The Conference agreed with the Com­
mittee's recommedation that the best and most economical protec­
tion against loss which the bankruptcy court can supply to creditors
and debtors in the event of a shortage in the trustee's accounts is to
make sure of the adequacy of the trustee's bonds. The Conference,
therefore, approved an additional guideline, as follows:
   That the amount of the bond of the trustee as a minimum be one and one-half
   times (150 percent) the average monthly balance in the trustee's accounts
   over the last twelve-month period.

                        SEMINARS FOR REFEREES

  Approximately 40 referees will participate in the Fifth Annual
Seminar and the final one in this series to be held in Washington
during the week of March 25, 1968, the Conference was told.
  Two regional refresher seminars have been held during the cur­
rent fiscal year, one in Denver and one in Tulsa. Two additional
regional seminars are planned before the end of the fiscal year to be
held in Chicago and New York.

              CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964
  Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act.

                       STATUTORY AMENDMENTS

  Judge Hastings advised the Conference that the study of the
administration of the Act, undertaken by the University of Chicago
School of Law under the direction of Professor Dallin Oaks, had
been completed and reviewed by the Committee. Judge Hastings
stated that the general conclusion reached by Professor Oaks is that
the administration of the Act has been praiseworthy, that the
judiciary moved with dispatch in promulgating plans for furnishing
representation and that the Administrative Office established
prompt and efficient payment procedures and forms. He stated
that the report carries a series of specific recommendations, each
predicated upon detailed analysis set forth in the reDort.
  As the Conference was advised at its September 1967 session
(Conf. Rept., p. 78), the report and recommendations were trans­
mitted to the subcommittee, chaired by Judge Johnsen, for further
                                 26 

study, review and recommendation to the Committee at its next
meeting. The subcommittee was formed pursuant to the mandate
of the Conference Committee of the Congress that the Department
of Justice, in cooperation with the Judi~ial Conference, obtain
the benefit of the experience in the operation of the Act and report
to the Congress on the advisability and feasibility of a public
defender sysrem as against an assigned-counsel system. The sub­
committee in making its study and preparing its report will work in
collaboration with the Department of Justice.
                  ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   Judge Hastings presented to the Conference the report of the
Administrative Office reflecting appointments and payments under
the Criminal Justice Act for the first six months of fiscal year 1968.
The Conference was advised that in this period the Administrative
Office received 11,870 orders appointing counsel under the Criminal
Justice Act, of which 2,173 were appointments by the Court of
General Sessions for the District of Columbia. During fiscal year
1967, attorneys were appointed to represent a total of 21,044 de­
fendants in the district courts and 964 appellants in the courts of
appeals. Cumulative net disbursements under the Act in the first         (
six months of fiscal year 1968 were $1,264,033. In the same period
district courts have authorized investigative, expert and other serv­
ices under subsection (e) to cost $31,741. Claims for protracred
representation were approved by the chief judges of the ~ourts of
appeals in 77 cases out of the appropriation for fiscal year 1967.
         ADVANCES UNDER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT

   Acting on a specific case in which a district judge had ordered
the Director of the Administrative Office to advance a sum of money
to appoint counsel for the purpose of travel and subsistence in con­
nection with the interview of witnesses prior to trial, the Confer­
ence agreed that the Administrative Office was correct in advising
the judge that since neither the appropriation for the Administra­
tive Office nor the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 contains any au­
thority for the advance of public money, the provisions of Section
529, Title 31, United States Code, must prevail.
   The Conference noted, however, that the court had possible
alrernatives; either in authorizing the assigned attorney to advance
his own money and immediarely upon return submit a voucher for
such expenses .which the Administrative Office could pay immedi­
                                27 

ately or assigned counsel could apply to the court for investigative
service pursuant to subsection (e) of the Act and arrangements
could be made for the interview of witnesses at distant points
through investigators obtained in accordance with the provisions
of the subsection.
        JUVENILE COURT OF THE DISTRIGr OF COLUMBIA

  Acting upon a specific order of appointment and voucher ap­
proved by a judge of the Juvenile Court for the District of Colum­
bia, the Conference agreed that the provisions of the Criminal
Justice Act did not apply to proceedings in the Juvenile Court for
the District of Columbia.
             TRANSCRIPT OF PRELIMINARY HEARING

   The Conference noted its approval of the action of the Adminis­
trative Office in paying a voucher approved by a district judge for
a copy of a transcript of a preliminary hearing. It noted that the
Administrative Office had advised the judge that where a person
may not be found to be a pauper and, therefore, not entitled to a
transcript under 28 U.S.C. 753(f), he may be provided with a pre­
liminary hearing transcript under 18 U.S.C. 3006A(e). The Confer­
ence noted that the Administrative Office suggested that rather
than have the attorney pay for such transcript and claim reim­
bursement, the reporter could complete a CJA Form 9 (so-called
Hother services voucher") to be supported by a CJA Form 10 con­
taining a certificate by the judge. Thus, the reporter would be paid
without delay.
                       RELEASE OF ACTION

  The Conference agreed that the report of the Committee as well
as the statistical exhibit prepared by the Administrative Office for
appointments and payments during the first half of fiscal year 1968
should be released immediately and directed the Director of the
Administrative Office to transrnit copies to all federal judges and
to the Chief Judges of the District of Columbia Court of General
Sessions and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

      ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law, Judge George C. Edwards, Jr., presented the
Committee's report.
                                  28 

                     SAFE-STREETS LEGISLATION

   Judge Edwards reported that S. 917, a bill to assist the state \
and local governments in reducing the incidence of crime, to in­
crease the effectiveness, fairness, and coordination of law enforce­
ment and criminal justice systems at all levels of government, had
been substantially amended in the Senate since the last report on
this bill to the Conference at the September 1967 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 8).
   The Conference voted to limit its action on this proposed legisla­
tion to the approval of the policy statement contained in Section 2
of S. 917. This is in accord with Conference action at the September
1967 session.

                 WIRETAPPING AND EAVESDROPPING

   The Conference noted and approved the Committee's report on
the subject of wiretapping and eavesdropping, bills pending in
the 90th Congress. It reviewed its action at the September 1965
session on H.R. 4348, 89th Congress, (Conf. Rept., p. 72) and
the action which it took at its September 1967 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 80) and stated that consistent with the recommendations previ­
ously made, without expressing preference for anyone of the sev­
eral bills now pending, the Conference is of the view that there
are areas of law enforcement in which the use of wiretapping and
eavesdropping devices should be permitted provided that any legis­
lation therefor meets the Constitutional standards of Berger v.
New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967) and Katz v. United States, 389
U.S. 347 (1967). The Conference agreed tha,t its action on this
subject matter should be released immediately.

             INTERSTATE AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS

   Judge Edwards advised the Conference that the Bureau of the
Budget has requested the Conference's views on a draft bill which
would make the United States a party to an agreement, already
joined in by over twenty states, under which prosecuting authori­
ties or prisoners under sentence in the jurisdiction of the signatories
may require the disposition of detainers pending against a prisoner
prior to the expiration of the term. The Conference approved the
draft bill.
                                29 

                AMNESTY FOR FIRST OFFENDERS

   Judge Edwards advised the Conference that the House Judiciary
Committee had asked its views on H.R. 11215, a bill to amend Title
28, United States Code, to provide amnesty for certain first offen­
ders under federal criminal law. The Conference disapproved the
bill in its present form but was of the view that the objective of
the bill deserves further study. The Conference, therefore, voted to
suggest to the Federal Judicial Center that this might be a fit
subject matter for research by the Center.

                         BAIL REFORM   ACT

  Judge Edwards advised the Conference that the Committee has
under consideration various proposals to amend the Bail Reform
Act of 1966. Included among them are proposals contained in
resolutions of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit that
the Act be amended to eliminate the requirement in the fixing of
bail that the court should take into consideration the weight of
the evidence against the accused to eliminate the provisions for
the subsequent 24-hour review of bail conditions and to provide the
same penalties for failure to appear in a misdemeanor case or as a
material witness as are now provided for failure to appear in a
felony case. Judge Edwards advised and the Conference approved
further research on this subject matter by a subcommittee chaired
by Judge Olin Hatfield Chilson.

                   INDETERMINATE SENTENCES

  The Conference noted a resolution of the Judicial Conference
of the Ninth Circuit at its 1007 meeting recommending to the
Judicial Conference of the United States that it give consideration
to the wisdom of seeking the enactment of appropriate legislation
for the use of the indeterminate sentence as the basic penalty or
sentencing statute for offenders against the United States. Judge
Edwards pointed out that this subject falls within the area of study
committed by Congress to the National Commission on the Reform
of Federal Criminal Laws. The Conference was in agreement and
authorized the transmission of the legislation to the National Com­
mission on the Reform of Federal Criminal Laws.
                                 30
    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
   Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on the Administration of the Probation System.
                      SENTENCING INSTITUTE

  The Conference approved the plans of the District of Columbia
Circuit for the holding of a Circuit Sentencing Institute in the fall
of 1968. The Conference noted that the agenda for the sentencing
institute will be submitted for its consideration at the September
1968 session.
                           LEGISLATION

   The Conference noted that the President in a message to the
Congress on February 7,1968 had again pointed out that the courts
supervise probation and parole while the Executive Branch ad­
ministers the prison system and that this division of responsibility
impedes the efforts to build a strong correctional system. The
President advocated to the Congress the establishment of a United
States Corrections Service within the Department of Justice. The
Conference was of the view that the most effective way to imple­
ment the President's recommendation for a United States Correc­         (   """\,
tions Service was in legislation approved by the Conference at its          ./
March 1967 session (Conf. Rept., p. 37) which would make changes
within the correctional organization of the Department of Justice
and would create a Corrections Council but would not divide or dis­
locate the probation service. The Conference reaffirmed its dis­
approval of S. 916 and H.R. 5038 in their present form since these
bills would remove from court control the supervision of persons
on probation. The Conference likewise reaffirmed its views ex­
pressed at the March 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 15) in opposi­
tion to placing the probation service under the jurisdiction and
control of the Department of Justice. The Conference instructed
the Director of the Administrative Office to convey to the President
of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and
the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of each Body the opposi­
tion of the Conference to the bills now pending and the endorse­
ment of the amended draft of S. 916 which would strengthen the
correctional organization of the Department of Justice and create
a Corrections Council but not divide or dislocate the probation
service.
                                                                        (
                                 31

         COMMITTEE      O~   SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
  The report of the Committee on Supporting Personnel was
presented to the Conference by its Chairman, Judge Theodore
Levin.
     ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT TO CIRCUIT CHIEF           J TInGES
   The Conference noted and approved a report of the Committee
which recommends legislation to establish the position of admin­
istrative assistant to the chief judge of each circuit. Such adminis­
trative assistant should have the qualifications to warrant the
grade of JSP 14. The Conference noted that the Committee report
recommends that the initial appropriation request, if overall statu­
tory authorization is granted, be limited to the six courts of appeals
in which there are eight or more circuit judges and in which the
chief judge has indicated an immediate need for an administrative
assistant.
                         CoURT REPORTERS

   The Judicial Conference approved the drafting and submission
to the Congress of legislation which would eliminate from Section
753(e) of Title 28, United States Code, the dollar restriction on the
annual salary of court reporters and give the Judicial Conference
full authority to set the salaries of court reporters. The Conference
noted the significant disparities which now exist in several districts
between the salaries of state court reporters and federal reporters.
The Director of the Administrative Office was directed to draft
and submit to the Congress an appropriate legislative proposal
to carry out the Conference action.
   The Conference declined the request of the United States Dis­
trict Court for the District of Columbia that a new and higher
category of transcript rate be established in order to expedite the
production of transcripts, such new rate to equal that charged for
daily copy. The Conference noted the Committee report which
stated that the problem of court reporters in the District of Colum­
bia has been raised many times and that the District Court now has
twenty court reporters for its fifteen active judges, a ratio of court
reporters to active judges which is higher than in any other district.
The Conference also noted that the Administrative Office has
consistently authorized temporary reporters for the senior judges
of the Court and, further, that there are three existing vacancies
                                  32 

on the District Court. The Conference also approved the establish­
ment of a subcommittee of the Committee on Supporting Person­
nel to make a complete study of the Court Reporters Act to
determine its present adequacy and to make appropriate
recommendations.
                       CAREER LAW CLERKS

   The Conference noted and approved the Committee recommen­
dation that the limit of the salaries of law clerks should be Grade
JSP 12. The Federal Salary Act of 1967 raised salaries retroactively
to October 1967 and provided for two additional increases for
graded employees as of July 1969. When these two increases are
put into effect, the steps in Grade JSP 12 will range from $12,800 per
year to $16,700 per year. The Conference agreed that a minimum of
five years of service by the law clerk would be necessary before he
could be considered a career law clerk. At that time he would
normally be in Step 4 of Grade JSP 12 and would have received
increases in excess of $1,500. Once a law clerk becomes a career
law clerk, the Conference agreed that the present fifteen-year
period to advance from Step 4 to Step 10 should be shortened to a
minimum of eight years.
                                                                         (
                 NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS

   The Conference disapproved a request for an increase for the
commissioner at Yosemite National Park but agreed to authorize
the Director of the Administrative Office to grant to park commis­
sioners the same percentage increase that Congress authorizes for
graded employees. This order is effective with the next statutory
increase and will be effective for all future statutory increases.

            TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE
  Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on Trial Practice and Technique.
  Judge Murrah advised that under Committee auspices three
seminars for newly appointed judges have been projected for 1968;
the first such seminar to commence in Denver in late May, a second
in Berkeley in mid-July and a third in Denver in October. Each
seminar is to be approximately nine days in length and it is hoped
that each judge appointed since the last seminar in June 1965 will
have an opportunity to attend one of the three sessions.
                                                                         (

                       M UL'l'IPLE   LITIGATION

   Judge Edwin A. Robson spoke in behalf of the report of the Sub­
committee on Multiple Litigation and summarized the principal
activities of the subcommittee since the last session of the Con­
ference in coordinating certain types of multi-district litigation. He
stated that the Committee has performed its services by identify­
ing, analyzing and recommending procedures for coordinated
processing of major multi-district civil actions which present
complex problems similar to those raised by and amenable to
techniques developed in the electrical equipment, rock salt and
aluminum cable antitrust litigation and in the air crash disaster
cases.
  Judge Robson stated that in accordance with the action of the
Judicial Conference at its September 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p.
63), the subcommittee had continued its plans to revise the Outline
of Suggested Procedures and Materials for Pretrial and Trial of
Complex and Multiple Litigation. It is contemplated that the
Manual will contain a looseleaf appendix which will contain a
continually revised and supplemented collection of legal essays,
briefs, documents, forms and sample orders for use in implementing
the procedures recommended in the Manual. The Conference
agreed that the subcommittee should continue to undertake its
revision of the Outline and submit it to the Conference as soon as
completed as well as the projected Manual.

               COMMENTS ON LEGISLATION

   The Conference noted that some criticism has been raised to the
fact that the Conference undertakes to consider, study and express
its views on pending legislation which affects or is of interest
to the judiciary even when the views of the Judicial Conference
have not been expressly requested by some committee of the Con­
gress or by the Bureau of the Budget. The Conference was of the
view that it is appropriate for the Conference to study legislation
affecting the judiciary and that the views of the Conference should
be given in advance of consideration on such legislation even
though its views have not specifically been sought. The Conference
voted to adhere to its present practice.

PRETERMISSION OF 	 THE TERMS OF COURTS OF
                   APPEALS                f
   At the request of Chief Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., the
Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented to the preter­
mission of the term of court of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit scheduled to be held at Asheville, North Carolina, in
June 1968.
   At the request of Chief Judge Martin D. Van Oosterhout, the
Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented to the pretermis­
sion of the terms of court of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit to be held at Kansas City, Omaha and St. Paul in 1968.
                            RESOLUTIONS
  Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah of the Tenth Circuit advised the
Conference of the passing of Mrs. Orie L. Phillips, wife of Senior
Judge Orie L. Phillips, and the Conference voted the following
resolution:
     Resolved: That the members of the Judicial Conference express their
   deepest sorrow at the passing of Mrs. Orie L. Phillips, wife of their colleague
   of many years, Judge Orie L. Phillips, and that the Conference send to Judge
   Phillips this expression of profound sympathy.                                  { -)
   The Chief Justice advised the Conference of the death on Feb­
ruary 26 of the Honorable William F. Smith, Judge of the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit and former Chairman of the Con­
ference Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.
The Conference requested the Chief Justice to advise Judge Smith's
widow of its sorrow and sympathy and voted to stand adjourned
in memory of Judge Smith.
            RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
   The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
on matters considered at this session where necessary for legislative
or administrative action.
