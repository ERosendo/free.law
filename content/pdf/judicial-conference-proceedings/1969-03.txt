  ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES
                    COURTS
     Ernest C. Friesen, Jr., Director of the Administrative Office,
  United States Courts, reported to the Conference on the business
  in the Federal courts for the first half of fiscal year 1969.
     Mr. Friesen noted that in the courts of appeals there WM an in­
  crease of almost 8 percent in terminations over the same period in
  fiscal year 1968. Nonetheless, in the same period, the total number
  of cases docketed rose by 11.7 percent and, accordingly, filings out­
  stripped dispositions by 925 cases and the pending caseload in the
  courts of appeals on December 31, 1968, reached an all-time high
  of 7,540.
     Mr. Friesen expressed concern in the increase in the number of
  cases under submission in the courts of appeals and noted that the
  increase in new appeals around the country was spotty, with the
                                         3

      highest increases in filings in the District of Columbia and the Fifth
(     and Sixth Circuits. He noted that while there was an 87 percent in­
      crease in filings in the courts of appeals over a 7-year period, the
      judicial manpower in these courts during the same period increased
      by 24 percent.
         During the first half of fiscal year 1969, Mr. Frjesen noted a 7.4
      percent increase in civil actions commenced in the district courts.
      During the same period, the increased number of terminations
      failed to outstrip the filings so that at the close of calendar year
      1968 pending civil actions reached a new high of 84,995. He pointed
      out, however, that the substantial increase in civil suits filed by the
      United States Government resulted almost entirely from the ad­
      vent of a large number of suits filed by United States Attorneys
      under Title 3 of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act. In the first
      half of fiscal yea.r 1968, 36 such actions were filed whereas in the
      first half of 1969, 823 suits were entered. Prisoner petitions con­
     tinued to increase during the period. Filings by such proceedings
     increased 12.3 percent in the first 6 months of fiscal year 1969.
         Mr. Friesen stated that criminal cases also increased to the extent
     that as of December 31, 1968, the pending caseload figure was 14
     percent higher than at the same time a year earlier. The criminal
(	   caseload increase reflects, in part, the increases in the number of
     Assistant United States Attorneys. Mr. Friesen stressed that pri­
     ority must be given to the criminal docket to insure each defendant
     his right to a speedy trial. While most courts are faithfully following
     this practice, Mr. Friesen urged all courts to do everything in their
     power to guarantee the right to a speedy trial in criminal cases.
         In discussing the length of time from the start of a case until the
     completion of a jury trial, Mr. Friesen urged wise use Oof the inter­
     circuit assignment system. He also urged that the responsibility
     for calendar control rests with the judges rather than the
     prosecutors.
                      FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER
        Mr. Justice Clark, Director of the Federal Judicial Center, re­
     ported to the Conference Gn the GperatiGns Gf the Center frGm the
     periGd July 1,1968, to March 1, 1969.
        Mr. Justice Clark discussed first the appropriations fOor the Cen­
     ter which for fiscal year 1968 totaled $40,000 and for fiscal year
     1969, $300,000. FGr fiscal 1970, he stated that the Center is request­
     ing $875,000. The increase is directed to three areas-research, ed­
(    ucation and training, and personnel.
                                 4

   The Center sponsored and directly supervised a seminar for
newly appointed judges for the first time in October 1968 and Jus­
tice Clark stated that in the future the Center will assume full re­
sponsibility for the seminars, both for newly appointed judges and
for those being planned for more experienced judges. The Center
is also planning seminars and training programs directed toward
clerks of court, probation officers and referees in bankruptcy.
   The first metropolitan court conference of chief judges and execu­
tive committees of eight districts was held at the Center in Jan­
uary and was devoted to many problems facing metropolitan
courts, particula.rly backlogs and delays in the judicial process.
   Other projects and programs of the Center in the process of im­
plementation involve computerizing the dockets in the Southern
and Eastern Districts of New York and the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, and completely reorganizing the Clerk's Office in the
Eastern District of Louisiana; in developing crash programs in
criminal cases and using pretrial techniques in the disposition of
cases in several districts; in organizing intensive pretrial in indi­
vidual calendar systems and trial pools in the central calendar sys­
tems; in helping districts switch from central to individual calen­
daring where that appears helpful; in screening cases in the courts (
of appeals; research in personal injury litigation and in developing
postconviction remedy programs and creating a statewide data
bank on habeas corpus-postconviction litigation; in selecting jury
panels through automation and teaching the efficient utilization
of juror time; in developing a punchcard probation report tech­
nique and instituting case aids in parole and probation surveillance
and developing three types of publications to disseminate knowl­
edge and techniques to the personnel of the judicial branch-a
newsletter entitled "The Third Branch," "The Federal Judicial
 Center Report," and specialty manuals, such as "The Judges'
Handbook" and the "Manual on Complex and Multidistrict
Litigation."
                  ELECTION OF BOARD MEMBER

   The Conference was advised that the I-year term of Judge Wade
H. McCree, Jr., as a member of the Board of the Federal Judicial
Center would terminate on March 28. Inasmuch as Judge McCree
is eligible to serve a full 4-year term as a member of the Board,
the Conference voted to elect him, pursuant to Sections 621 and
629 of Title 28, United States Code.                              \

       JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION
{        Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Judicial Panel
     on Multidistrict Litigation, reported on the activities of the Panel
     since its organization in the summer of 1968.
         Judge Murrah stated that since its organization the Pa.nel has
     formally considered, either on motion of a party or its own initia­
     tive, 16 groups of cases which, collectively, include more than 600
     cases in 44 different Federal district courts. The Panel has de­
     termined that transfer under Section 1407 was appropriate in nine
     of these 16 groups of cases a.nd 202 cases have been transferred to
     seven different federal district courts for coordinated or consolidated
     pretrial proceedings. Judge Murrah stated that the Panel's docket
     has been dominated by multiple (airline crashes) and treble dam­
     age antitrust litigation. These account for 14 of the 16 groups of
     matters considered by the Panel. Other multidistrict litigation con­
     sidered thus far have involved patent infringement actions and a
     group of cases requesting infringement relief against the Postmaster
     General with regard to certain fourth class bulk mailing regulations.
     The Panel has thus far made the final determination in 10 of the
     16 groups of cases and in only one has the motion to transfer been
     denied.
(       Judge Murrah stated that because of the volume of multidistrict
     litigation, the Panel has been meeting once each month, generally
     on the fourth Friday of the month. The staff of the Panel main­
     tains a complete docket system and extensive files for all matters
     before the Panel.
                     JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
        Chief Judge William J. Campbell, Chairman of the standing
     Committee of the Conference on the Budget, reported that hear­
     ings were held by the Subcommittee of the Appropriations Com­
     mittee of the House of Representatives on March 12, 1969. Judge
     Campbell stated that the requests for fiscal year 1970 provided
     for the employment of 36 additional deputy clerks and 33 stenog­
     raphers for the courts of appeals. Provision has been made for 205
     deputy clerks for the district courts, 166 of whom are requested
     for the administration of the new random jury selection process.
     Thirty-nine are requested to cope with the general increase in the
     workload. The estimate also contemplates adjustments in the
\,   courts and salaries of law clerks and crief-law clerks based on the
                                  6

new classification standards approved by the Conference at its
September 1968 meeting (Conf. Rept., pp. 59-61). Also included
in the request for appropriations for fiscal year 1970 are 27 addi­
 tional positions in the Administrative Office. Three of these posi­
tions are designed to perform the duties required of the Director
under the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, four relate to the
Jury Selection and Service Act, three are requested to coordinate
the conduct of a survey of the courts required under the Federal
Magistrates Act, three are requested in connection with newly
created circuit judgeships, three for a proposed caseload manage­
ment study and 11 relate to current functions and responsibilities
of the Administrative Office.
   Judge Campbell stated that no date has yet been set for hearings
on the appropriations in the Senate. He noted, however, in the
hearings before the House of Representatives Subcommittee, com­
mittee members were particularly critical of the action of certain
judges in discontinuing the acceptance of passport applications.
The Subcommittee, Judge Campbell stated, made its disapproval
of such unilateral action clear and indicated that any further oc­
currences might compel the Subcommittee to make appropriate
reductions in the supporting personnel of the judiciary.
                                                                        (
                 COURT ADMINISTRATION
 Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Chairman of the general Com­
mittee of the Conference on Court Administration, presented that
Committee's report.

                       LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

   Judge Ainsworth stated that the Senate Subcommittee on Im­
provements in Judicial Machinery had submitted for Conference
consideration a proposed bill which would provide for the appoint­
ment of a court executive for each judicial circuit. The bill would
provide that the court executive should exercise administrative
powers .and perform duties delegated to him by the circuit council.
The bill then specifies in considerable detail some of the types of
duties which theoourt executive would perform, including adminis­
trative control of all nonjudicial activities of the court personnel,
budget administration, space management and property control,
and the initiation of studies relating to the busineas and adminis­
tration of the oourts within the circuits.
                                       .7
        The Conference voted to approve, in principle, legislation au­
     thorizing the judicial council to appoint court executives to exer7
     cise such duties as are delegated to him by the circuit council); i          <




     The Conference was opposed, however, to the specificity as t(ji!
     duties and responsibilities in the original draft submitted for its,; I

        The Conference approved a bill proposed by the Department m)l J

        The Conference approved H.R. 7039, a bill to add Reading as ai' )
     place of holding court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
     Judge Hastie advised the Gmference that both the district court:! i;
     judges and the Judicial Council of the Circuit had previously aP"ifi
     proved Reading as a place of holding court in the Eastern District"(f
     of Pennsylvania.                                                  ;':0 [
        The Conference considered and voted its disapproval of Senatenj

     available, the Committee, through its Subcommittee on FederaF;] i
     Jurisdiotion, will submit summaries of these studies to the judg<M1 'J

     1968 (Conf. Rept., p. 82) in requesting reports from the chief judg&JT
     of the circuits by July 1, 1969, created an unrealistic target datEr'"

                     ADDl'IION AL JUDGESHIPS

   Judge Ainsworth advised the Conference that the Committee
had studied S. 474, a bill to add an additional judge in the Western
District of Tennessee, and had examined all relevant statistical data
concerning this bill, as well as the recommendation of the Judicial
Council of the Sixth Circuit approving the request for an addi­
tional judgeship in the Western District of Tennessee. The Con­
ference agreed with the Committee recommendation that S. 474 be
approved, with the suggestion that this additional judgeship be in­
corporated in S. 952, 91st Congress, a bill incorporating the recom­
mendations for additional judgeships approved by the Judicial
Conference in September 1968 (Conf. Rept., pp. 49-51).
   Judge Ainsworth advised the Conference that his Committee had
also noted requests for additional judgeships for the Western
District of Missouri and for the District of Nebraska. The latter
request is included in a bill now pending in the 91st Congress, S.
1036. Judge Ainsworth advised the Conference that the Commit­
tee did not believe the situation in either of these districts con­
stituted an emergency and, accordingly, had requested its Sub­
committee on Judicial Statistics to make a detailed study of these
two districts. After discussion, Chief Judge Harper requested, and
the Conference agreed, to the withdrawal from Committee and
Subcommittee consideration of the judgeship requests in the West­
ern District of Missouri and the District of Nebraska.

                     SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

   The Conference voted to reaffirm its support of legislation au­
thorizing cost of living allowances for judicial employees stationed
outside the continental United States or in Alaska. The Confer­
ence had approved prior bills on this subject in the 89th and 90th
Congresses (Conf. Rept., Feb. 1968, p. 15; March 1965, pp. 15,36).
   The Conference reaffirmed its support of legislation approved at
its February 1968 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 31) that the Congress
eliminate the maximum and minimum limitations on the annual
salary which the Judicial Conference may fix for court reporters.
The Conference noted that the situation which originally gave
rise to this legislation has grown more acute since some state courts
have authorized salaries substantially higher than those permitted
to federal reporters.
                                             9


      Chief Judge Bazelon advised the Conference that the District
    Court of the District of Columbia had been handicapped in ob­
    taining adequate court reporter services and, accordingly, pro­
    posed an amendment to Section 753 of Title 28, United States
    Code, to which the Conference agreed. This amendment would
    provide a new subsection (g) which would read:
       If the judicial council of any circuit determines that the services of court re­
    porters for any district court within the circuit should be provided the judges
    of such district courts (including the senior judges thereof when such senior
    judges are performing subtantial judicial services for such court) on a con­
    tract basIs, rather than by appointment of court reporters as otherwise pro­
    vided in this section, and such judicial council notifies the Director of the .Ad­
    ministrative Office, in writing, of such determination, the Director of the .Ad­
    ministrative Office is authorized to and shall contract with any suitable person,
    firm, association or corporation for the providing of court reporters 00 serve
    such district court under such terms and conditions as the Director of the
    .Administrative Office finds, after consultation with the chief judge of the cir­
    cuit and the chief judge of the district court, will best serve the needs of such
    district court.
                                  ADMINISTRATION

       Chief Judge Brown addressed the Conference on the needs of
    an overall study looking toward improvement in court adminis­
    tration in the district courts and the courts of appeals and the utili­
    zation of modern machinery and techniques in order to fulfill the
    meaning of the courts. Judge Brown moved and the Conference
(   agreed:
      That the Committee on Court .Administration, as a whole and through its sub­
    committees, in cooperatfon with the .Administrative Office and the Federal Judicial
     Center, explore with diligence and without delay and report to the Conference
    next September on the availability of modern .business methoos to improve court
    administration in the district courts and in the courts of appeals and recommend
    to the Conference -as to the utilization of modern machines and their costs, to­
    gether with the needed personnel on a realistic basis that will get people on the
    task at the time they are needed.


                                 CRIMINAL LAW

      Judge George C. Edwards, Jr., Chairman, presented the report
    of the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.
                PERSONS ACQUITTED ON GROUNDS OF INSANITY

      Judge Edwards reported that in the newly reconstituted com­
    mittee he had reappointed Judge Zirpoli as chairman and Judges
    Larson and Spears as members of a subcommittee to study legis­
          352-492--69----3
(
                                  10 

lative proposals providing for the commitment of persons acquit­
ted on the grounds of insanity. The subcommittee is charged with
continuing a survey of persons acquitted to determine how many
had raised the defense of insanity at trial. The Administrative
Office is preparing listings of all acquittal cases over a 2-year pe­
riod and each chief judge of a district court is being asked to have
the jackets and dockets in his clerk's office checked to ascertain in
which cases acquittal was sought on the grounds of insanity.
   The subcommittee is charged with meeting with representatives
of the Probation Committee, as well as with representatives of the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

                         BAIL REFORM     Am'
   Judge Edwards advised the Conference that several bills have
already been introduced in the 9lst Congress proposing amend­
ments to the Bail Reform Act. Some of these bills include proposals
for preventive detention in lieu of release prior to trial and others
relate to danger to the community as a basis for release. Judge
Edwards presented a report by a subcommittee consisting of Judges
Sobeloff, Bryant and Garrity which suggested that proposals to
remedy the present crime problem by means of preventive deten­
tion are premature. The subcommittee agreed that the element of
dangerousness to the community may properly be considered by the
judicial officer in fixing release conditions other than the require­
ment of mandatory baiL The subcommittee would restrict consid­
eration of dangerousness to nonfinancial release conditions. After
considerable discussion of the subcommittee report, the Conference
agreed to table the report at this time.

                  EXPEDITING CRIMINAL JUSTICE

  Judge Edwards stated that his Committee sought Conference
authorization to conduct a study of ways and means to expedite
criminal justice, enlisting the help of the Federal Judicial Center
in this endeavor and to report to the Conference at a later session.
The Conference agreed with this request.

                      SENTENCING PROBLEMS

  Judge Edwards reported to the Conference that the Committee
had discussed, generally, problems of sentencing and of providing for
treatment in Federal institutions after sentencing, with particular
                                            11 

     reference to a need for diagnostic facilities and more adequate fa­
     cilities for psychiatric treatment. The Conference agreed that the
     Committee should be authorized to study this subject, in depth,
     possibly in conjunction with the Bureau of Prisons, with a view to
     later report to the Conference.

                  OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM

      Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman of the Committee on the
     Operation of the Jury System, presented the Committee's report.

                       JURY SELECTION AND SERVICE              ACT
       Judge Kaufman noted to the Conference the provision of the
     Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 which requires each district
     court to submit a report on the jury selection process within its
     jurisdiction to the Administrative Office of the United States
     Courts in such form and at such terms as the Judicial Conference
     of the United States may specify; the Conference is authorized to
     adopt rules and regulations governing the provisions and the op­
     eration of the plans formulated under the Act.
        Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that the reviewing
(	   panels of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits on their own initiative have
     already instituted proceedings through sampling techniques to de­
     termine whether jury questionnaires addressed to persons whose
     names have been selected from voter lists are actually reaching a
     fair cross-section of the population of the district. In commending
     the action of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits, Judge Kaufman stated
     that his Committee recommends a series of resolutions to which the
     Conference agreed as follows:
       (1) 	That the Oommittee on the Operation of the Jury System undertake It
            study of the general system for the submission of periodic reports by the
            district courts on the operation 'Of their respective jury selection systems
           as contemplated 'by 28 u.s.c. 1863 (a) , and that the Committee report
            on its recommendations and any prop0j3ed rules to the next session CIt the
            Conference.
       (2) 	That pending the outcome of such report by the Committee to the Con·
            ference, other Circuit Judicial Councils are requested to undertake circuit·
            wide programs for postauditing the various selection programs through
            sampling techniques patterned on the postaudit programs of the Fourth
            and Fifth Circuits and the district courts will furnish the Councils with
            Slreh information and reports as they may requIre for such programs, and
            that when such reports are made tOo the Circuit Judicial Councils, copies
            should be sent flo the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System.
                                         12 

   (3) 	That the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System and the Admin­
        istrative Office of the United SlJates Courts lend such assistance as may
        be available to the various district courts in implementing such postaudit
        program.
   (4) 	'l'hat the Committee be authorized to communicate with selected Chief
        Judges and solicit their views as to other characteristics of jurors selected
        under the new Act as compared with those called to serve previously; for
        example, average ages, economic ,status, ethnic group, conscientiousness,
        caIYdhllity, etc. Such information would be helpful in appraising the impact
        of the policy of random selection of jurors on the Federal court system.
   (5) 	 That authority be given for the immediate release to the courts of the
        contents of the foregoing paragraphs of this resolution.
     Judge Kaufman stated further that his Committee had con­
  sidered a problem relating to those courts which have commissioned
 state or other custodians of voter lists (including lists recorded
  manually or in computer readable form) to make the original
 random choice of names to be placed in the master jury wheel. The
 Committee is of the view that some such delegation under carefully
 prescribed directions is implied if data computers are to be used at
 all. Further, there are some districts where for a variety of reasons
 copies of juror lists are not available and the original manual selec­
 tion of names for the master jury wheel must be made in the office
 of county clerks or of other custodians of voter lists.
    Judge Kaufman said that since it would be expensive and time­
 consuming in some cases to use regular deputy clerks for this pur­
 pose, some temporary assistance haa been sought to aid in making
 the original selection of names for the master wheel. Some persons
 so assisting have been temporary employees of the clerk's office
 while others have been state or municipal employees, usually the
custodians of the original voter lists. Judge Kaufman advised the
 Conference that his Committee is of the view that the district plan
should provide for written notification to a person deputized so
 that he will perform his duties as an agent of the district court and
that he be furnished a detailed description of the methods and the
formula he is to follow in making the selection, as well as a form of
certificate of affirmation that he has complied in all particulars
with the formula in making the name selection.
    On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed
that all district courts which find it necessary to use persons other
than a jury commission or members of the staff of the clerk's office
for the original selection of names from voter lists for use in the
selection of jurors in accordance with the Jury Selection and Serv­
ice Act of 1968:
                                            13 

      (1) 	Review their district jury plans to determine whether they comply with
           the specificity requirements of 28 U.S.C., § 1863 (b) (3) in describing the
           procedures to be followed by persons other than the jury commission or
           the clerk's office;
      (2) 	 Undertake the preparation of appropriate forms advising such persons
           in detail of their responsibilities and of appropriate certification of com­
           pliance by them.
        Judge Kaufman further advised the Conference that in imple­
     menting the Jury Selection and Service Act, the Committee had
     noted that some of the district jury plans have included in the
     listing of "groups Oof persons" or lIoccupational classes" whose mem­
     bers are entitled to be excused permanently from jury service on
     the request of a member of the class or group a provision for the
     excuses of individuals (rather than a class) on the basis Oof personal
     hardship. He stated that the Committee is of the view that a
     provision for excuse based on individual and personal hardship is
     improperly included in this part of the plan. The procedure fOor ex­
     cusing individuals on a basis Oof a proper showing for personal hard­
     ship is contained in Section 1866(c) of Title 28, United States Code,
     and is a temporary rather than a permanent excuse. Accordingly,
     the Conference approved a Committee recommendatiOon that each
     district court examine its jury selection plan to determine whether
     the "class" or (Igroup" excuses listed pursuant to 28 U.S.C., § 1863
(    (b) (5) may erroneously include temporary excuses based on per­
    sonal hardship as defined in § 1866(c)(I), and, if so, to institute
    corrective procedures.
       Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that one problem which
    had arisen in implementing the Act was in connection with the sec­
    tion requiring the United States marshal to mail summonses. He
    stated that in some large areas it is required that large bags of mail
    be carried to the United States marshal by the clerk merely for the
    purpose of handing the mail bags over to the post office-a mechan­
    ical and unnecessary step in the process of jury selection. Accord­
    ingly, the Committee recommended and the Conference approved
    the transmittal to the Congress of a draft bill which would allow
    mail service of juror summonses to be made by clerks and deputy
    clerks of court, as well as by United States marshals.
                    JUROR QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE

      Judge Kaufman advised that the Committee is considering the
    present form of juror qualification questionnaire and many com­
    ments which have been received concerning its contents and format.
                                  14 

He stated that the Committee suggests to those courts which desire
additional information for use at the voir dire that a second ques­
tionnaire be devised to be filled out at the time the prospective
juror receives the summons or when he appears for jury service.
This form could, for example, require that the prospective juror
identify the nature of his occupation and the occupations of his
near relatives, as well as require him to supply other information
not relevant to qualification but valuable to the more efficient use
of the juror and court time at the voir dire.

                      VOIR DIRE PROCEDURES

   Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that the Committee
will undertake a study of juror questioning procedures. Among the
factors to be examined are appropriate methods for efficiently
discovering necessary background information from prospective
jurors; a. comparison between systems in which the judge does all
the questioning, in which the attorneys do the questioning and a
combination of both; the validity of assumptions concerning prob­
able juror behaviour and the validity of our present system of cause
and preemptory challenges; the methods and order of challenge;
the problems of delay in choosing jurors and the problem of sepa­
rating alternates from other jurors.

                  COMPUTER SELECTION PROJECTS

   Judge Kaufman described to the Conference the method being
used in the Eastern District of N ew York whereby data computers
are utilized for the selection process and for preparing and apprais­
ing questionnaires and summonses. The Conference agreed that
each district court should study the feasibility of converting to a
data computer system for the selection of jurors, and that the Ad­
ministrative Office of the United States Courts should lend such
help as may be available for this purpose. It also agreed that copies
of the report of Norbert A. Halloran, Systems Analyst, describing
the techniques and propriety of such a conversion and an extract
from the Jury Plan of the Southern District of New York illus­
trating the integration of computer techniques into jury selection
shall be sent to the chief judge of each district court without delay.

         PILOT STUDY ON UTILIZATION OF JUROR TIME

  Judge Kaufman reminded the Conference that at the Septem­
ber 1968 meeting he reported the commencement of a project under
                                     15 

    auspices of the American Bar Foundation to be undertaken in
    the Western District of Missouri to determine utilization of juror
    time (Conf. Rept., p. 68). He stated that Mr. Frederick R. Merrill
    of the American Bar Foundation who had conducted the study has
    reported to the Committee on his findings which yielded valuable
    information and clear guides for extending the project to a large
    metropolitan district. The Conference agreed to extend its appre­
    ciation to the American Bar Foundation for this valuable study
    and expressed its approval of the proposal suggested in the pre­
    liminary report on the effective utilization of jurors by the Ameri­
    can Bar Foundation that this research project be extended by the
    Foundation staff to a major metropolitan court center where the
    need for efficient utilization of jurors is most critical. The Confer­
    ence agreed that this project should go forward without delay be­
    cause of the urgent need to take early corrective measures in light
    of the recommendations to be contained in the final report of the
    American Bar Foundation.
                             JUROR HANDBOOKS

       Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that the Petit Juror
    Handbook prepared in 1962 had not been distributed pending a
    study of existing handbooks but that his Committee had found that
(
    the jurors had benefited from using the existing handbook and, ac­
    cordingly, the Conference agreed to approve the renewed distribu­
    tion of the existing handbook if the district judge wished it. Judge
    Kaufman also advised the Conference that a handbook for grand
    jurors is under preparation.
                          PREJUDICIAL PUBLICITY

      Judge Kaufman told the Conference that several district courts
    have not advised the Committee, through the Administrative Office,
    as to whether any changes in their existing rules were needed to
    comply with the action of the Conference at its September 1968
    meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 66) in approving the Committee report on
    Free Press-Fair Trial. The Conference agreed that a district court
    which has taken no action with respect to the Conference recom­
    mendation that it enact rules relating to the Free Press--Fair
    Trial problem in accordance with a report made to the September
    1968 meeting, now consider prompt implementation of that report
    and advise the Committee, through the Administrative Office, of
    the action taken.
                                   16
                    STIPULATIONS AS TO JURORS

   Judge Kaufman stated that in a discussion of the more eco­
nomical and efficient use of juries, it was suggested that all courts
may not be utilizing the provisions of Rule 48 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 23(b) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure which allow a case to proceed by stipulation
with a jury of less than 12. The Conference noted that the Com­
mittee will invite the attention of district courts to the feasibility of
stipulations which would permit the calling of fewer than 12 jurors,
the calling of fewer or no alternate jurors and to stipulations in
civil cases to accept less than a unanimous verdict. The Committee
agreed, on suggestion of Judge Harper, to study the possibility of
uniformity in the methods of jury qualifications and challenges.

             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

  Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman of the standing Committee
of the Conference on Bankruptcy Administration, presented the
Committee's report.

                       SALARIES OF REFEREES

   Judge Weinfeld advised the Conference that the President's
recommendations, based on a report of a commission authorized
under Public Law 90-206, were transmitted to the Congress on
January 16, 1969, and raised the maximum limit on salaries of full­
time referees in bankruptcy from $22,500 per annum to $36,000
per annum and the limit on salaries of part-time referees in bank­
ruptcy from $11,000 per annum to $18,000 per annum. After
considering the recommendations of the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office, the Committee, the district courts and the judicial
councils involved, the Conference agreed to the schedule of salaries,
as recommended by the Director and approved by the Committee,
set forth below. These salaries are to be effective on April 1, 1969.
Not included below are the Districts of Northern Oklahoma, West­
ern Oklahoma and Utah; the Chief Judge of the Tenth Circuit
advised the Conference that recommendations relating to these
three districts ",ill be presented to the September 1969 meeting of
the Conference.

          first $100,000 of total obligations paid or extended in Chap­
          ter XI cases and one-half of one percent on the balance.
In approving the foregoing, the Conference noted that the addi­
tional sum to be raised by the change of fees will still fall far short
of raising the total payments into the fund to the level of annual
obligations against it.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee's view that the prin­
ciple of a self-supporting bankruptcy system is outdated and that it
                                  24
is no longer possible to maintain adequate payments into the fund
without placing an inordinate burden upon bankrupts and the as­
sets of bankrupt estates. The Conference approved a statement
of policy that the legal limitation imposed in the Bankruptcy Act
should be removed and that the concept of the Referee's Salary
and Expense Fund should be abandoned.

                        NEW CASE FILINGS

  In fiscal year 1968 the total number of cases filed was 197,792,
a decline of 10,537 cases, or 5.1 percent. In the first half of fiscal
year 1969 a total of 89,076 cases was filed as compared with 97,634
in the comparable period of the prior year, an 8.8 percent decline.

                            LEGISLATION

   The Conference noted that its views have been requested on
H.R. 16711, 90th Congress, a bill to amend Section 57(n) of the
Bankruptcy Act to provide that the claims of creditors of corporate
bankrupts without notice of the bankruptcy proceedings and not
filed within the 6-month limitation now required may be filed
at any time before the date of the referee's order allowing final dis­
tribution. The Conference disapproved the proposed legislation in
that it does not exclude from those who may be permitted to file
late claims those creditors who are in fact scheduled by the bank­
rupt. Further, the Conference was of the view that permitting the
filing of late claims up to the time of final distribution is too un­
limited and disruptive of orderly and expeditious adminstration of
estates. The Conference took the position that the proposed legisla­
tion would be a windfall to the creditor who does not file until he
determines that there are assets and that it would encourage such
dilatory practices.
                                                                         j
   The amendment further would be detrimental to compromises             '1
and settlements for which there must be a certainty as to the             !
amount of claims that are to be paid.                                     '.
                                                                         '"JI
             RETIREMENT AND TENURE OF REFEREES

   The Conference took note of legislation .which had been pending
in the 90th Congress (H.R. 6240, H.R. 9718, and S. 1316), all re­
                                                                         I
garding tenure and retirement benefits of referees. The Conference        'f
considered the recommendations of the Committee and agreed
to certain changes in these proposed bills to provide for 12-year          j
terms for full-time referees and 6-year terms for part-time referees.
                                                                           iI

                                                                          I
                                  25 

   Referees who reach the age of 70 and have completed 5 years of
service are automatically separated on the last day of the month
on which the referee becomes 70 years of age or completes 5 years
if he has already reached 70. The proposed bill provides for the
payment of retirement benefits from the Civil Service Retirement
and Disability Fund and makes provision for the computation of
annuities. In general, the retirement plan for referees, as proposed,
would be comparable to the retirement benefits now provided for
members of Congress.

                  AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   In the audit of statistical reports of closed asset and arrangement
proceedings successfully concluded under Chapter XI during the
first 6 months of fiscal year 1969,270 inquiries have been made by
the Audit Unit of the Bankruptcy Division. The audit program
continues to reveal more overpayments to the Referee's Salary and
Expense Fund than underpayments. The audit has also revealed a
number of overpayments of commissions to receivers or trustees
and has succeeded in recovering $788 for the benefit of creditors.
Six cases involving overpayments totaling $36,466 are still pending.

                   MATTERS UNDER SUBMISSION

   Of 209 referees reporting for the quarter ending December 31,
1968, a total of 50 matters were being held without decision by 23
referees. The Conference noted that it is the view of the Bank­
ruptcy Division that this number appears to be normal and rep­
resents marked improvement over previous reports.

         DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER XIII

  Judge Weinfeld stated that the Administrative Office reports
that a total of 31,065 Chapter XIII cases<was filed in 1968. This is
898 cases below the 1967 level, a decline of 2.8 percent.
  Judge Weinfeld advised that Chapter XIII guidelines hereto­
fore promulgated by the Judicial Conference are generally being
complied with by the bankruptcy courts. Cost study tables of Chap­
ter XIII trustees' operations distributed to the judges and referees
for fiscal year 1968 are bringing about a closer examination of ex­
penses of Chapter XIII trustees and have resulted in some re..'
duction in these costs,

                          SEMINARS FOR REFEREES

   Judge Weinfeld advised the Conference that regional2-day semi­
nars for referees in bankruptcy have been held in St. Paul, Minn.,
Portland, Oreg., Athens, Ga., and Birmingham, Ala. Additional
seminars are planned in succeeding months in Los Angeles, Dallas,
Cincinnati, Chicago, and New York City. Judge Weinfeld ex­
pressed the view that these regional programs are constantly im­
proving and that those innovations introduced at recent seminars
have proved valuable. He stated that the sixth national seminar for
newly appointed referees is now being planned for Washington,
D.C., in September 1969. Approximately 15 referees appointed
since the last national seminar in March 1968 will participate.
           FEES AND CHARGES IN REOPENED PROCEEDINGS

   Judge Weinfeld advised the Conference that a number of ref­
erees have recommended that the Conference regulations requir­
ing payment of a new filing fee upon reopening of a closed
bankruptcy case be amended so that under certain circumstances
courts may reopen closed cases without the payment of a new filing
fee. In many closed proceedings certain creditors regularly sue
bankrupts on discharged debts in state courts. These suits in state
courts are brought after the cases are closed and no relief can be
granted to the debtor except upon the payment of a new filing fee
                                                                                       I

                                                                                       I
recommendation, the Conference approved an amendment to its
                                                                                       1

  Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman of the standing Com­
mittee of the Conference on the Administration of the Probation
System, presented the Committee's report.

                      SENTENCING INSTITUTE

   Judge Hoffman advised that the Third Judicial Circuit is con­
templating a sentencing institute to be held at Morgantown,
W. Va., in October 1969. The agenda will be submitted for Confer­
ence approval at the September 1969 meeting. Upon recommenda­
tion of the Committee, the Conference approved the proposed sen­
tencing institute.

        RESIDENTIAL CoMMUNITY TREATMENT CENTERS

   The Conference considered H.R. 2175, 91st Congress, a measure
to authorize the Attorney General to admit to residential commu­
nity treatment centers persons who are placed on probation, released
on parole or mandatorily released from Federal institutions. The
Conference noted that it had approved similar legislation pending
in the 90th Congress, H.R. 10511 (Conf. Rept., September 1967, p.
82). The Conference reaffirmed its approval of this legislation by
endorsing H.R. 2175.

              UNITED STATES CoRREcTIONS SERVICE

   Judge Hoffman advised the Conference that H.R. 2169 wasintro­
duced in the 91st Congress on January 6, 1969. He stated that this
measure is identical with H.R. 5038 and S. 916, 90th Congress, bills
previously disapproved by the Conference (Conf. Rept., March
1967, p. 37). These bills would remove from court control the su­
pervision of persons on probation and would place that responsibil­
ity under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General. The Conference
voted its disapproval of H.R. 2169, 91st Congress, and reaffirmed
its opposition to placing the probation service under the jurisdiction
and control of the Department of Justice (Conf. Rept., March 1966,
p. 15). In so doing, the Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of the
substance of this and prior legislation (H.R. 5038 and S. 916, 90th
Cong.) and reaffirmed its approval of an amended draft of S. 916
which would make changes within the correctional organization of
the Department of Justice and would provide a strengthened cor­
rections council but would not divide or dislocate the probation
service (Conf. Repts., March 1967, p. 37, and February 1968, p. 30).

                      DEFERRED    PROSECUTION

  Judge Hoffman advised the Conference that pursuant to the au­
thority of the Conference at its September 1968 meeting (Con£.
Rept., p. 69), he and Judge Stephens, a former member of the Com­
mittee, had met with the Director of the Federal Judicial Center
with a view toward the possibility of a study, in depth, of the prob­
lem of deferred prosecution by the Center. At the suggestion of
Mr. Justice Clark, Judge Hoffman stated that he had appointed a
subcommittee to work on this matter with the Center.

               INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS

   Judge Edward A. Tamm, Chairman of the standing Committee                  'I
of the Conference on Intercircuit Assignments, presented the Com­
mittee's report.
   Judge Tamm stated that the reconstituted committee held its
organizational meeting on February 17,1969 and considered several
policy matters for the future operation of the committee. These
matters remain under study for future report to the Oonference.
   Judge Tamm stated that the Committee had disapproved the re­
quest for the intercircuit assignment of a district court judge to try
two lengthy cases in Toledo, Ohio, on the basis that existing calen-     (
daring problems throughout the country made it appear desirable
that the situation in Toledo be handled on an intracircuit basis.
   He stated that as a general policy the Committee had adopted as
a measure of the need for outside assignment calendaring situations
in which a district court is delinquent more than 6 months in the
disposition of its criminal docket and/or delinquent 1 year or more
in the disposition of its civil calendar. He stated that the Com~
mittee had also approved as a general policy the proposal that each
judge assigned to an intercircuit assignment should be permitted to
take with him on that assignment a secretary and a law clerk, as
well as a court reporter if a full-time reporter is not available in
the district where the visiting district judge is to sit.
  Judge Tamm stated that these and other policy considerations
will guide the Committee for the present pending further study of
them and submission of them to the Judicial Conference for
approval.

           TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE 

  Chief Judge Joe E. Estes, Chairman of the standing Committee
of the Conference on Trial Practice and Technique, advised the
Conference that his Committee was organized too late to present a
formal report to the Conference. He stated that the Committee had
met only the prior week for the first time but that it had decided
that priority will be given by the Committee to developing and dis­
seminating through manual materials and seminars­
  (1) 	Techniques on effective calendaring, pretrial and trial,
       with immediate consideration of
       (a) 	The "Omnibus Hearing" procedures in criminal cases,
       (b) 	Pretrial procedures in the complex criminal case, and
       (c) 	The handling of postconviction remedy problems;
  (2) Assistance in annotating, updating and furnishing new ma­
       terials for incorporation in manuals heretofore approved by
       the Conference; and
  (3) 	Jury instructions, including sample forms for submissions on
       special interrogatories under Rule 49, Federal Rules of
       Criminal Procedure.

IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL MAGISTRATES ACT

   Judge William E. Doyle, Chairman of the standing Committee of
 the Conference to Implement the Federal Magistrates Act, pre­
 sented the Committee's report.
   The Committee to Implement the Federal Magistrates Act was
created, with the assent of the Conference, subsequent to the en­
actment of the statute on October 17, 1968 (Public Law 90-578)
which provides for the establishment in place of the United States
commissioner system the office of United States magistrate.
   Judge Doyle advised the Conference that his Committee has met
twice and has also conferred by letter and telephone on several
occasions in preparing the first recommendations of the Committee
to the Conference and in assisting the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office of the United States Courts in connection with his
immediate responsibilities under the Act of conducting within 1
year of the enactment of the statute a careful survey of condi­
tions in judicial districts to determine the number of appoint­
                                         30 

menta of full-time and part-time magistrates required for the
expeditious and effective administration of justice, the locations
at which such officers shall serve, and their respective salaries.
                                    PILOT PROGRAM

   Judge Doyle advised the Conference that the Committee was
agreed that because of the need for experience in establishing the
offices of full-time and part-time United States magistrates, the
pilot program was desirable to assist in the transition from the
commissioner system to the magistrate system. He stated that
the Committee was of the view that such a program should be in­
stituted at the earliest possible date and no later than May 1, 1969,
so that the Director of the Administrative Office would have the
benefit of the experience of this pilot program prior to the time
when his surveys must be completed, namely, October 17, 1969.
   The Conference considered the recommendations of the Commit­
tee and agreed to the establishment of five pilot districts-the
District of Columbia, the District of New Jersey, the District of
Kansas, the Southern District of California, and the Eastern Dis­
trict of Virginia. It was noted that the district courts and the circuit
councils involved in these five areas were in agreement with the
establishment of the program.                                                 (
   Judge Doyle advised the Conference that the Director and the
Committee had proposed these five areas because each represented
a different type of problem with which Federal magistrates would
be concerned. He pointed out to the Conference that the magis­
trate, in addition to assuming all powers and duties heretofore
conferred upon commissioners, would also have the authority to
conduct trials in minor offense cases, serve as a special master in
appropriate civil actions, assist a district judge in the conduct of
pretrial or discovery proceedings in civil or criminal actions, and
conduct preliminary reviews of applications for posttrial relief
made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses.
   The Conference agreed to the following recommendations for
magistrate positions in the five pilot districts:

narcotic cases can no longer be diverted to local courts.

                           STANDARDS FOR SELECTION

   The Conference considered tentative standards suggested by the
Committee and agreed that these standards for appointment of
magistrates needed further study and requested the Committee
to report to the September 1969 meeting of the Conference. The
Conference was in agreement, however, that as to the pilot districts,
it was important that the appointees to positions in the pilot pro­
gram be the subject of a check prior to appointment by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The Conference also agreed with the prin­
ciple that the maximum salaries of magistrates should be on a
parity with maximum salaries paid to referees in bankruptcy.

                  JURISDICTION OF MAGISTRATES

   Judge Doyle advised the Conference that he had appointed a
subcommittee to study, in depth, the various duties and responsi­
bilities which may be assigned to magistrates and any possible
constitutional limit'ations on such delegations. A preliminary re­
port by the subcommittee was concerned largely with the problem
of how minor offenses would be channeled to the magistrate and,
particularly, to a question left silent in the Act relating to the prob­
                                                                           J
lem of whether the Government had to give its prior consent to
trial before the magistrate. The Conference noted that the subcom-
mittee will continue its study, with particular reference to the
                                                                           I
                                                                           ,
practical and permissible scope of judicial functions which may be
delegated to the magistrate.
   In approving the preliminary report of the subcommittee, the
Conference agreed to a proposal to circularize the chief judges of
the district courts to canvass their ideas on this subject.
                   CoNFLICT OF INTEREST RULES

   Judge Doyle pointed out to the Conference that part-time magis­
trates may under the Act engage in the practice of law, except that
they may not serve as counsel in any criminal action in any court
of the United States and that they may not act in any capacity that (
is under such regulations as the Conference may establish as in­
consistent with the proper discharge of their office. Judge Doyle
advised that he had appointed a subcommittee to make recom­
mendations to the Conference on this subject and that the subcom­
mittee had recommended six regulations to define the conduct of
part-time magistrates, their partners and associates in those in­
stances where a conflict of interest may arise. These six regulations
were approved by the Conference as follows:
   1. 	 A part-time magistrate, his partners and associates, may ap­
        pear as counsel in any civil action in any court or govern­
        mental agency, including matters in which the United States
        is a party or has a direct and substantial interest, but they
        may not appear in cases in which the part-time magistrate
        ha.s been involved in connection with his official duties.
   2. 	 A part-time magistrate, his partners or associates, may appear
        as counsel in any matter before the Internal Revenue Service,
        other than in those matters in which the part-time magistrate
        has been involved in connection with his official duties.
                                 33 

  3. 	A part-time magistrate may appear as counsel in a criminal
       action in any state court, but is precluded from appearing as
       counsel in any criminal action in any court of the United
       States.
  4. 	 A part-time magistrate's partners and associates may appear
       as counsel in any criminal action in any st.ate court and in
       any federal court other than in the district in which the part­
       time magistrate serves, provided that the part-time magis­
       trate has not been involved in such criminal proceeding in
       connection with his official duties.
  5. 	A part-time magistrate is precluded from using his official
       office to refer cases to his partners, associates or to others.
  6. 	 Generally, a part-time magistrate represents conflicting in­
       terests when, in behalf of the Government, it is his official
       duty to take certain action or contend for that which duty
       to another would require him to oppose.
                   FORFEITURE OF COLLATERAL

   Judge Doyle advised the Conference that statistics show that
some of the busiest United States commissioners have heretofore
earned their fees by handling traffic cases on Federal enclaves and
that the great majority of these are disposed of without trial. He
said that the Committee was of the view that if the process of
routinely arresting these petty offenders could be dispensed with
in favor of a more uniform adoption of a system of collateral for­
feiture, this would, in large part, obviate the necessity of bringing
petty offenders before a judicial officer, thus freeing the magis­
trate for duties of more substantial benefit to the district courts.
He advised that the Committee has urged the Administrative Office
to continue its study of various systems for collateral forfeiture
with a view to submitting a plan which can be adopted under the
magistrates system.

                  ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

   Judge Doyle pointed out that the Federal Magistrates Act
authorized the Administrative Office, with the approval of the
Judicial (;onference, to promulgate certain rules and regulations
for the administration of the various provisions of the Act. As a
result, the Administrative Office has prepared regulations on an
experimental basis designed to serve as interim regulations in ad­
                                 34 

ministering the pilot program. These include regulations governing
expenses of full-time magistrates, including compensation of sec­
retarial and clerical assistants, regulations governing payment of
compensation of part-time magistrates and reimbursement for ex­
penses, including secretarial and clerical assistance, and regulations
governing the recording and transcriptions of proceedings before
magistrates. He stated also that the Administrative Office has de­
vised certain in terim financial proceedings for the collection of
collateral, fines, proceeds from the sale of transcripts or tapes and
for the handling of other receipts and disbursements incident to
the administration of the pilot program.
   The Conference approved the adoption of the interim regula­
tions for use in the pilot program.

                                SEAL

  On Committee recommendation, the Conference approved a seal
similar to that now used by United States commissioners except
that the words "United States Magistrate" shall be substituted for
"United States Commissioner."

        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROOEDURE
                                                                         (
  Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman, presented the report of the
standing Committee of the Conference on Rules of Practice and
Procedure.
                         CRIMINAL RULES

   Judge Maris advised the Conference that in view of the
recommendation of the Committee to Implement the Federal Mag­
istrates Act to establish pilot districts, now approved by the Confer­
ence, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules had prepared
and the standing Committee has approved a set of interim rules to
govern the procedure of the magistrates in the five pilot districts.
These rules of procedure for magistrates are designed only as in­
terim rules in order to make it possible for the magistrates to func­
tion in the trial of minor offenses in the pilot districts. The Advisory
Committee on Criminal Rules will continue to study rules of prac­
tice and procedure before United States magistrates with a view
to making more complete recommendations at an appropriate time
in the future.
   The Conference considered and approved these proposed interim
rules for magistrates and authorized transmission of them to the(,
                                  85 

Supreme Court in accordance with authority granted in Section
3402 of the Magistrates Act.
   Judge Maris advised the Conference that the Advisory Commit­
tee on Criminal Rules is also continuing its work on other phases of
criminal procedure which will be the subject of report to the Con­
ference at a forthcoming meeting.

                            CIVIL RULES

   Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules
was expected to meet in April to consider the comments of the
bench and bar on proposed amendments to the civil rules, largely
relating to discovery, which were published in November 1967. Un­
less the Committee decides in its action at the April meeting that
they will require resubmission to the bench and bar, it is anticipated
that the proposed discovery rules will be submitted to the standing
Committee at its July meeting and be ready for Conference action
at the September 1969 meeting of the Conference.
                         ADMIRALTY RULES

   The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules, Judge Maris
reported, is continuing its consideration of the operation of the uni­
fied civil rules with respect to maritime cases, as well as the supple­
men tal admiralty rules, and is working on draft legislation to amend
the Federal statutes relating to admiralty procedure in order to
bring them into conformity with the procedure and nomenclature of
the unified rules.
                        BANKRUPTCY RULES

  The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules has substantially
completed its task of preparing uniform rules for bankruptcy cases
and Judge Maris reported that the Committee is now at work on
rules of procedure under Chapters X, XI, XII, and XIII of the
Bankruptcy Act. The Committee is also working on necessary
amendments to the Act to eliminate the procedural provisions
which will be covered by the rules.
                        RULES OF EVIDENCE

  Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Rules of
Evidence had completed its preliminary draft on uniform rules of
evidence for the Federal courts and that distribution of this draft
to the bench and bar for comments and suggestions is expected in
early April.

                          ApPELLATE RULES

   Following the adoption of the appellate rules and the discharge
of the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules, Judge Maris said
:that the standing Committee has undertaken to folow the opera­
tion of the rules and to report upon such modifications, if any, as
seem to be needed as a result of experience.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT
   In the absence of the Committee Chairman, Judge John S. Has­
tings, Judge Harvey M. Johnsen presented the report of the special
Committee of the Conference to Implement the Criminal Justice
Act.
                  ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   Judge Johnsen advised that the Administrative Office had sub­
mitted a report of activities relating to the Criminal Justice Act
 through December 31,1968. The report showed cumulative net dis­
bursements under the Act from its effective date, August 20, 1965,
 through December 31, 1968, as $8,103,346. The report shows a sharp
increase in the volume of vouchers submitted and forecasts the pos­
sibility that for the first time it may be necessary to seek a supple­     (
mental appropriation for fiscal year 1968. In fiscal year 1968,
payments for services rendered to defendants aggregated $3,877,2-66
as compared with $1,569,278 in 1967 and $729,278 in 1966.
   The Committee noted that the chief judges of the courts of ap­
peals have approved 67 claims for protracted representation pay­
able out of the 1968 appropriation. The Committee also observed
that the bulk of the authorizations for investigative, expert and
other services fell into three categories--investigative services, serv­
ices of psychiatrists, and services of interpreters.
   The Conference approved the recommendation of the Commit­
tee that the Director of the Administrative Office be authorized to
distribute copies of the report to all Federal judges, as well as to
the Chief Judges of the District of Columbia Court of General
Sessions, the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia, and the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
                             GUIDELINES

  Judge Johnsen advised the Conference that a subcommittee was
continuing its work of preparing guidelines of general application         (
                                37 

to assist Federal judges, commissioners, and clerks of court. He
stated that the subcommittee will also draft proposed changes of
general application to district court plans which will be necessi­
tated by the Federal Magistrates Act.
         JUVENILE COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

   Judge Johnsen advised the Conference that, pursuant to a com­
munication from Chief Judge Bazelon of the District of Columbia
Circuit, the Committee had studied the question of the applicabil­
ity of the Criminal Justice Act to the Juvenile Court of the Dis­
trict of Columbia. The Committee noted that just as there are
United States Cases in the Court of General Sessions, so also the
Juvenile Court has jurisdiction over certain United States Cases.
Accordingly, the Committee was of the view that the reasoning of
the Comptroller General in his opinion of June 12, 1966 relating
to United States Cases in the Court of General Sessions was also
applicable to counsel assigned in any United States Case in the
Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia provided that the plan
for the District of Columbia encompasses representation for de­
fendants charged with felonies or misdemeanors, other than petty
offenses, in the Juvenile Court.
            TRANSCRIPTS IN PETTY OFFENSE CASES

   Judge Johnsen advised the Conference that the Committee was
apprised of a letter from the General Accounting Office requesting
its views as to whether payment might be made under the Criminal
Justice Act for a transcript in a United States Case in the Court
of General Sessions of the District of Columbia involving a petty
offense. Judge Johnsen stated that the Committee was unani­
mously of the view that the Act expressly excludes representation
in petty offense cases for all purposes, whether for fees, expenses
or other services.
                    STATUTORY AMENDMENTS

  The Conference noted that the recommendations for amend­
ments to the Criminal Justice Act, which the Conference had ap­
proved at its September 1968 meeting (Coni. Rept., pp. 71-73),
were the subject of a bill introduced in the 90th Congress by Sena­
tor Hruska and reintroduced on January 27, 1969 in the 9Ist
Congress as S. 650. The Conference voted to reaffirm its endorse­
ment of these proposals by endorsing S. 650.
                                3S 

   The Conference also noted that subsequent legislation had been
introduced carrying out recommendations of the former Deputy
Attorney General relating to the utilization of a public defender
system. The Conference agreed with the Committee recommenda­
tion that these legislative proposals required further study, in
conjunction with the study of a report to be submitted by the
                                                                              I
Department of Justice as required by the Congressional Conference
Committee in 1964. This report, which is to be made in collabora­
tion with the Judicial Conference, is to deal with comparative
merits of an assigned counsel system versus a public defender
                                                                              I

system.

PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS
   At the request of Chief Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., the
Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented to the pretermis­
sion of the term of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
scheduled to be held at Asheville in June 1969.
   At the request of Chief Judge Van Oosterhout, the Conference,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented to the pretermission of the
terms of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to be held at
Kansas City, Omaha, and St. Paulin 1969.

tive or administrative action.

         exeept that provided by law for the performance of his judicial duties.
         Provided however, the judicial council of the circuit (or in the case of
         oourts not part of a circuit, the judges of the court in active service)
        may upon application of a judge approve the aeeeptanee of compen­
        sation for the performanee of services other than his judicial duties
        upon a determination that the services are in the public interest or
        are justified by exceptional cIrcumstances and that the services will
        not Interfere with his judicial duties. Both the services to be performed
        and the compensation to be paid shall be made a matter of public
        record and reported to the Judicial Conferenee of the United States.
