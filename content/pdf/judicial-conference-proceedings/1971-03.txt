sented to the Conference by the Chairman and they greeted the
Conference and spoke briefly on problems relating to judicial ad­
ministration. The Chief Justice, as Chairman of the Conference,
presented an illuminated scroll copy of the Conference Resolution

  The Honorable Erwin N. Griswold, Solicitor General of the

                      EXECUTIVE COMMITEE
   Chief Judge Lumbard, Chairman, reported tha,t his Committee,
sitting as a Nominating Committee, had considered nominations
for two vacancies about to occur on the Board of the Federal Ju­
dicial Center and that the Committee recommended to the Con­
ference the names of the Honorable Frank M. Coffin, Judge of the
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, for the vacancy caused by
the expiration of the term of the Honorable James M. Carter on
March 28, 1971, and the Honorable Adrian A. Spears, Chief Judge
                                      3

     of the United States District Court for the Western District of
     Texas, to succeed the Honorable Edward J. Devitt, Chief Judge of
     the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota,
     whose term also expires on March 28. The Conference agreed to
     both nominations and Judges Coffin and Spears were elected to
     the Board of the Center for a term beginning March 28, 1971.

                     COMMITTEE ON SALARIES
        The Chief Justice brought to the attention of the Conference
     the fact that some of the committee reports which have been circu­
     lated to the Conference call for study and increases in salaries for
     clerks of court, pretrial examiners, referees in bankruptcy and
     United States magistrates. After discussing this matter, the Con­
     ference was in agreement that there was a need to study the salary
     structure of such positions in the federal judiciary, possibly with
     advice from the Civil Service Commission, rather than having a
     piecemeal consideration as to each position. It was decided that
     such a committee should be created, with the members appointed
     by the Chief Justice, and the scope of this study should include
     referees in bankruptcy, magistrates, clerks of court, pretrial ex­
     aminers and other ungraded positions within the judiciary. The
(   ,Conference also agreed that the Executive Committee should be
     vested with authority to act on behalf of the Conference if any
     emergency matter was brought to attention by the Salary Com­
     mittee requiring immediate action which should not await the
     next session of the Conference.
        COMMITTEE ON COURT ROOM FACILITIES AND
                       DESIGN
       The Conference discussed the problem of increasing building
    costs and agreed that, except where imperatively needed, the size
    of court rooms should be cut back substantially provided each
    court house had one or two large court rooms for special cases. The
    Conference further agreed that there was a need for concepts of
    design in order to draft plans that would afford greater security and
    to simplify court room control. It was agreed that the Conference
    should work in close cooperation with the General Services Ad­
    ministration on these matters. For this purpose the Chief Justice
    was authorized to appoint an ad hoc committee on court room
    facilities, design and security.                             .

                                  1
               CRIMINAL LAW 

  Senior Judge Breitenstein, appointed as Acting Chairman for
the purpose of this session of the Conference, presented the report 	
                                                                            I,

                                                                            I
of the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.

                 N ONTESTIMONIAL        IDENTIFICATION
                                                                            I
   Judge Breitenstein stated that the views of the Conference had
been requested on a Department of Justice draft bill which would
amend Title 18, United States Code, to provide for the issuance to          1
certain persons of judicial orders to appear for the purpose of con­
ducting non testimonial identification procedures. As drafted, the
bill would provide that if a judicial officer finds there is probable
cause to believe that an offense has been committed, that there are
reasonable grounds, but less than probable cause, to suspect a named
individual of committing the offense, and that the results of certain
specific non testimonial procedures will materially aid in determin­
ing whether the named person committed the offense, an order
shall issue requiring the person to appear at a designated time and
place for nontestimonial identification.
  The Conference approved this draft legislation in principle pro­
vided it is amended to specify that the individual will be required
to appear first before a judicial officer, that the right to counsel will
be explicitly stated and that the individual will be advised at such
appearance before the judicial officer of his right to counsel. The
Conference further stipulated that such legislation should provide
for a prompt hearing and appearance in all cases.

                    EXTRATERRITORIAL OFFENSES

  Judge Breitenstein stated that the Conference's views had been
requested on H.R. 18857, gIst Congress, which would provide a
forum in which individuals committing crimes abroad while mem­
bers of the armed forces or accompanying such forces be tried even
though the military courts were without jurisdiction, either because
the individual has been discharged from the armed forces or as a
civilian not subject to the jurisdiction of the military courts. The
Conference approved this proposed legislation.

                      EXPU:l'{GI:l'{G CRIMI:l'{AL RECORDS

  The Controlled Dangerous Substances Act (Public Law 91-513)
provides for the expunging of criminal records of certain first
offenders under age twenty-one charged only with possession of a
controlled dangerous substance and placed on probation. In order
that the clerks of court may adopt a uniform procedure in carrying
out the provisions of Section 404 of this act, the Conference agreed
that the clerks of court should be instructed to proceed as follows:
  Pursuant to an order under this section, the Clerk shall first obliterate the
name of the individual from all indexes, and shall withdraw the docket sheets
and the file containing the papers of the case from the court records. He then shall
notify the Administrative Office, the court reporter, the probation officer and the
magistrate of the order instructing them to make a similar obliteration and
withdrawal of the papers in the case and delivery of the papers to the Clerk.
  All the papers shall thereupQn be expunged by being placed in the sealed
records of the court to be opened only upon court order, and shall be physically
destroyed after 10 years.

                      EXPEDITING CRIMINAL JUS'l'ICE

   In considering this subject matter, the Committee recommended
and the Conference agreed that the rules adopted by the Courts of
of Appeals in the First and Tenth Circuits concerning the issuance
of the mandate upon affirmance of conviction should be circulated
to the judicial councils of the other circuts for their consideration.

COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY
                SYSTEM
  Circuit Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman of the Committee
on the Operation of the Jury System, presented the Committee's
report.
                                SIZE OF JURIES

  Judge Kaufman advised that the Committee had considered the
question of the size of a federal jury in civil cases as had been done
by local rule in five or six districts. The following resolution was
adopted after extended discussion:
   Be tt re80lved oy the JudioiaZ Oonferenoe of the United States, That it adopts
the recommendations of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System that
the Conference approve in principle a reduction in the size of juries in civll
trials in UnIted States district courts, and upon such reduction that there be a
diminution in the peremptory challenges normally allowed. It Is also resolved
that the means to effectuate the objectives set forth in this resolution, I.e., by
                                      6

rnlemaking or statute, be referred to the Committees on Civil Rules and on the 

OIleration of the Jury System.

                  EFFICIENT UTILIZATION OF JURORS

   The Committee having circulated to all district courts a proposed
formula whereby court personnel could calculate the proper number
of prospective jurors who should be summoned, the Chairman re­
ported the Committee's view that a significant improvement in
juror utilization will come only when more detailed guidelines are
furnished. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts was requested to prepare for periodic circulation to
the chief judges of the courts of appeals and of the district courts,
and to incorporate in his published reports, a comparative summary
of jury utilization as reflected in the JS 11 reporting form.

                  AUTOMATION OF JUROR SELECTION

   At present, only five district courts have completed the automa­
tion process for the selection and summoning of jurors. The Con­
ference agreed that the Director of the Administrative Office should
determine the district courts in which the automation of the juror
selection process is feasible, establish target dates for conversion,
and work with district court personnel to assure that the targets
are met. The Conference agreed that, within permissible budget
limits, the Administrative Office should hire additional personnel
as may be necessary to carry out the automation of juror selection.
                 EMPLOYER'S DISCHARGE OF JURORS

   Because of the number of instances in which federal grand and
petit jurors have allegedly been discharged from employment be­
cause of their jury service, the Conference agreed to a draft bill to
amend Chapter 73 of Title 18, United States Code, by adding a
new Section 1511 which would provide that no employer may dis­
charge any employee because he is or has been serving or attending
upon any court in connection with possible service as a juror in any
United States Court. Violation of this provision would involve a
fine of not more than $1,000, imprisonment of not more than one
year, or both.

                  PERIODIC REPORTING ON JURY SELECTION

        Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference
     at its October 1969 session, the district courts will submit by Sep­
     tember 1, 1971 their first report on the jury selection process. The
     Conference agreed to two minor additions to the regulations pro­
     mulgated by the Judicial Conference in October 1969 in order to
     specify under Regulation 4 that the sample of jurors actually re­
     porting for service should, to the extent practicable, be the same size
     as the master jury wheel sample. Secondly, the Conference agreed to
     the addition of a new Regulation 6 to permit the Director of the Ad­
     ministrative Office, upon good cause shown, to permit the filing of
     a late report within a reasonable period after the due date.

                         REDUCTION IN VOTING AGE

       The lowering of the minimum age of voters in federal elections to
     eighteen years whereas Jury Selection and Service Act specifies
     that a person below the age of twenty-one may not serve as a
     juror in the federal courts: It was agreed that the Committee should
     consider problems arising as a result of this and make such further
r
     recommendations to the Conference.

                                   LEGISLATION

   The Conference approved two proposed items of legislation for
transmission to the 92nd Congress, as follows:
      (1) 	 A !Jill to provide that the term of office of a full-time referee shall be
          increased from six to twelve years and that the term of office of a
          part-time referee shall be f{)r a t{\rm of six years. The bill would also
          provide for mandatory retirement of a referee in bankruptcy at the age
          of seventy if he has completed five years of service; and
      (2) A bill which would amend the Civil Service retirement law to increase
          the retirement !Jenefits of referees in bankruptcy.

                       AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

  The audit of statistical reports of closed bankruptcy cases for the
previous six months disclosed some 226 possible errors in the re~
ports. In addition, some 35 letters have been written in connection
with preaudit of estate accounts.

                             CHAPTER      XIII   CASES

   The Committee reported that the Administrative Office has re­
ported the filing of a total of 30,510 cases under Chapter XIII of
the Bankruptcy Act in fiscal year 1970. This constitutes about 16
percent of the total filings under the Act. In three districts referees
have set up experimental programs or pilot projects to provide free
counselling to debtors in wage earner proceedings in order to assist
the debtors to avoid in the future the pitfalls which compel them
to seek relief in the bankruptcy courts.

FEE     FOR     ApPLICATIONS      TO   DETERMINE DISCHARGEABILITY                 OR
                NON - DISCHARGEABILITY OF SPECIFIC DEBTS

  The Conference agreed with a Committee recommendation which
would provide for a new charge for special services pursuant to
Section 40c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, to be effective April 1, 1971,
as follows:
     9. 	For each application for determination of non-discharge­
         ability of debts filed by creditors, a fee of $10.00.
                           SEMINARS FOR REFEREES

  A national seminar for newly-appointed referees in bankruptcy
will be held in Washington on March 22-26, 1971 and, in addition,
regional seminars have been held in Indianapolis, New York City,
                                 15 

San Francisco and New Orleans, and are scheduled for Phoenix
and Cleveland prior to the next session of the Conference.
   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

             PROBATION SYSTEM 

  Judge Walter E. Hoffman, retiring Chairman of the Committee
on the Administration of the Probation System, presented the
Committee's report.
                    CONDITIONS OF PROBATION

   The Committee has considered, with the cooperation of the Di­
vision of Probation of the Administrative Office, the suggestion
made at the March 1970 session of the Conference that a study
 be conducted to determine the feasibility of having the Conference
adopt a resolution recommending that a person placed on proba­
tion be required to work unless the court otherwise orders.
   The Committee was mindful of its 1964 report wherein it stated
as a condition of probation that the individual shall work regu­
larly at a lawful occupation and shall support his legal dependents
and when out of work shall notify the probation officer at once.
The Conference agreed that a comprehensive study of this prob­
lem was not required at this time and that the prior condition
of probation was adequate.
                           LEGISLATION

   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of a proposal made at
the March 1970 session to provide for the protection of probation
officers by amending Section 1114 of Title 18, United States Code.
The Director of the Administrative Office was requested to retrans­
mit the proposed legislation to effectuate this purpose to the
Congress.
              AMENDMENT OF CruMINAL RULE         32
  The Committee recommended to the Advisory Committee on
Criminal Rules a revision of Rule 32 to provide that presentence
investigation reports which are made a pa,rt of the record shall be
sealed and opened only on order of the court.

    COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
   Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman of the Committee on Inter­
circuit Assignments, presented the Committee's report encompass­
ing its activities from September 15, 1970 to February 1, 1971.
   During the period in question the Committee recommended 44
assignments to be undertaken by 37 judges. Of this number, four
are circuit judges in active status, six are senior circuit judges, 13
are district judges in active status and seven are senior district
judges. Six assignments were carried out by four active judges
of the Court of Claims and one by an active judge of the Customs
Court. Two retired Supreme Court Justices carried out three
assignments.
   During the period there were 22 assignments to the circuit courts
of appeals, four to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 17
to the district courts and one to the Court of Claims.

      COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL 

               MAGISTRA TES ACT 

  Judge Charles M. Metzner, Chairman of the Committee to
Implement the Federal Magistrates Act, presented the report of
the Committee.
                      :MAGISTRATE POSI'l'rONS

   The Committee had considered various requests received from
the district courts for additional magistrate positions, changes in
sa,laries and arrangements, and changes in the official locations of
positions. In addition, four district courts had requested authority
to appoint persons to part-time magistrate positions who are not
members of the bar. In accordance with the recommendations of
the Committee, the Conference approved the following changes
in the numbers, locations, a,rrangements, and salaries of magis­
trates and directed that they be made effective at such time as
appropriated funds are available. It also voted the Executive Com­
mittee plenary authority to act for the Conference between ses­
sions on any such matters which in the view of the Magistrates
Committee require immediate action.

    The District Courts in Hawaii, Colorado, New Mexico and the
 Western District of Texas certified that they were unable to find a
 qualified member of the bar to accept the position of part-time
 United States magistrate at one or more locations within their
 districts. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
 authorized these courts to appoint non-members of the bar to part­
 time magistrate positions at the following locations:
      Western District of Texas-Big Bend N ationa.I Park
      Colorado-Rocky Mountain National Park
      Hawaii-Honolulu (one position), Johnston Island, and Wake
         Island
      New Mexico-Deming
   District courts in eight districts had submitted formal requests
for additional part-time magistrate positions at small salaries to
provide back-up magistrate services in the absence of a regular
magistrate from his official station because of business, vacation,
illness, or other good reason. The Committee requested and was
granted authority to consult further with these district courts re­
garding the need for such positions in their districts.
                       SALARIES OF MAGISTRATES

  The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm the
principle that the maximum salaries payable to United States
magistrates should be on a parity with the maximum salaries pay­
able to referees in bankruptcy (see Coni. Rept., March 1969, p. 31)
and that the Director of the Administrative Office be authorized to
                                 20 

prepare the necessary amendments to the statute and transmit
them to the Congress. The Conference, after full discussion, voted
to recommend that the ceiling on the salaries of United States
magistrates be removed and that the salaries of magistrates be fixed
from time to time by the Judicial Conference after receiving recom­
mendations of the Salary Committee, newly created.

                 REFEREE-MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

  The Conference had previously approved proposed legislation
to amend the Bankruptcy Act and the Federal Magistrates Act to
pennit full-time referees in bankruptcy to perform the duties of a
United States magistrate (Conf. Rept., March 1970, p. 23). This
proposal is embodied in H.R. 4815, recently introduced in the 92nd
Congress. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
voted to approve this bilL

                        LETTERS ROGATORY

   The legal advisor of the Department of State had inquired about
the possibility of delegating to United States magistrates the func­
tion of executing letters rogatory in criminal cases. The Conference
approved the recommendation of the Committee that the Depart­
ment of State be advised that the Judicial Conference has no objec­
tion to this proposaL

                      LOCAL RULES OF COURT

 The Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses Before
United States Magistrates, approved by the Supreme Court, pro­
vide in part for the reference of an information charging a minor
offense, other than a petty offense, to a magistrate and also for the
reference of an information transferred under Rule 20 to a magis­
trate for plea and sentence. The Conference, upon recommendation
of the Committee, authorized the distribution of a sample rule of
court to all district courts for such use as they may desire.

                  ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

  The Conference approved a proposed change in the regulations
of the Director of the Administrative Office to permit the direct
payment of the cost of telephone service for a part-time magistrate
who has been provided with office space in a federally owned or fed­
                                  21 

erally leased building, instead of requiring the General Services
Administration to bill the magistrate and have him in turn claim
reimbursement on his voucher.
      COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                  PROCEDURE 

   Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing Committee on
Rules of Practice and Procedure, presented the Committee's report.
   The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules has approved for
circulation to the bench and bar preliminary drafts of amendments
proposed to certain criminal rules which, hopefully, will be ready
for distribution in April, with a request for comments to be sub­
mitted before April 1, 1972. In addition, the Committee has circu­
lated two alternative proposals for amendments to Criminal Rule
45, relating to time limits which are directed toward the elimination
of present delays in the disposition of criminal cases. Because of
the urgency of this subject matter, comments are requested prior
to July 1, 1971. The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is
continuing to work on a draft of rules governing procedure in
habeas corpus cases involving state prisoners and cases under 28
U.S.C. 2255, as previously directed by the Conference.
   The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules has completed its
task of preparing a preliminary draft of all rules of procedure for
ordinary bankruptcy cases. This will be circulated during April 1971
and the deadline for receiving comments and suggestions will be
April 1, 1972. The Advisory Committee is now engaged in the
preparation of rules and forms for cases under Chapter XIII of the
Bankruptcy Act and when this study is completed the Committee
will turn its attention to the rules and forms for cases arising under
Chapters X, XI and XII of the Act. It is hoped that the proposed
rules for Chapters X through XIII will be ready for circulation
early in 1972.
   Pursuant to the Conference action at the October 1970 session,
a definitive draft of proposed rules of evidence was submitted to the
Supreme Court. The Court has now returned the draft to provide
an opportunity for public consideration of the modifications made
by the Advisory Committee, the standing Committee and the Ju­
dicial Conference since the last preliminary draft was circulated in
March 1969. Prompt publication of these proposed rules of evidence
                                        22 

is expected so that any further comments which may be submitted
may be considered by the Advisory Committee later in 1971.

COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
                   ACT
 Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman of the Committee to Imple­
ment the Criminal Justice Act, presented the Committee's report.
                     ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

  Judge Hastings presented to the Conference and the Conference
approved for immediate release and circulation the report of the
Director of the Administrative Office on appointments and pay­
ments made under the Criminal Justice Act through December 31,
1970.
  The report shows total payments under the Act since its inception
of $18,123,473.00. During the first half of fiscal year 1971, $2,827,­
101.00 was disbursed in the settlement of claims for services ren­
dered on behalf of criminal defendants and appellants.
                                     FORMS

   The Conference approved the recommendation of the Committee
for revised form for appointment and payment of counsel and a
revised form for authorization and compensation for expert and
other service. The Conference likewise approved an application
form for grants which will be submitted by community defender
organizations, as provided in subsection (h) of the Criminal Justice
Act, as amended. The Conference further approved a form for
appointment of counsel for alleged parole and mandatory release
violators.
                                 GUIDELINES

  The Conference approved certain additional guidelines for the
administration of the amended Criminal Justice Act, as follows:
  (1) 	Continued use of OJA Form SA, permitting a detailed statement of assets
       and llabilities of persons claiming inability to obtain counsel, is optional
       and may be used by judges and magistrates whenever, in their opinion,
       such use is deemed desirable;
  (2) 	CJA Form 6, order for terminating appointment of counsel, and CJA
       Form 7, authorization for distribution of available private funds, remain
      in full force and effect;
  (3) 	The salary of a federal publlc defender shall be approximately 85 percent
       of the salary of the United States Attorney in the same district pending
      further study of this subject matter by the Committee;                          '.
                                       23 

  (4) Community defender organizations operating under the fee system will
      continue to use the forms provided for service of expert and other services,
      with the person authorized by the court to perform such services as
      designated payee;
  (5) Community defender organizations operating under 	initial and sustain­
      ing grants approved by the Judicial Conference shall meet all expenses,
      including services other than counsel, under those grants. This does not,
      however, eliminate the requirement of court approval for the retention
      of expert and other services.

                 ApPROVAL OF GRANTS AND REPORTS

   The Criminal Justice Act, as amended, provides that upon appli­
cation a community defender organization may, to the extent
approved by the Judicial Conference, receive an initial grant for
expenses necessary to establish the organization and in lieu of
payments under subsections (d) and (e) receive periodic sustain­
ing grants. Since the statute does not provide any mechanism by
which the Conference shall exercise this authority, the Conference
agreed that any applications shall be screened by the Committee
to Implement the Criminal Justice Act and that the Executive
Committee of the Conference shall have interim authority to
approve the recommendations of the Committee between sessions
of the Conference.
   The statute also provides that the community defender organi­
zation, whether operating under a grant or under the fee system,
shall submit to the Conference an annual report setting forth its
activities and financial position and the anticipated caseload and
expenses for the coming year. It was agreed that the Committee
to Implement the Criminal Justice Act should have authority to
prescribe the form and contents of the annual report.
   The Committee has requested the Administrative Office to pre­
pare an administrative procedures manual to cover all matters
needed for the use of the public federal defenders, as well as the
requirements for budgetary submissions, as provided in the Act.
Such reports and budgetary requests shall be furnished to the Ad­
ministrative Office by the public defender no later than August 1
of each year.
   Since the Committee is of limited tenure, being designated as a
special committee, the Conference voted that the Committee con­
tinue during the interim period while the subsection (h) defender
organizations and any grants to community defender organizations
are being considered.

                         REVIEW COMMITTEE 

   Judge Edward A. Tamm, Chairman of the committee estab­
lished by the Chief Justice to review the reports filed semi-annually
by federal judges in connection with income received for services
rendered over and above judicial duties, submitted his report to
the Conference.
   The Conference discussed this report and, particularly in the
light of the resolution adopted by the Conference at its September
1963 meeting that "no justice or judge appointed under the author­
ity of the United States shall serve in the capacity of an officer,
director or employee of a corporation," voted with respect to a
judge (i) whose semi-annual report indicates non-compliance with
the 1963 resolution of the Judicial Conference or (ii) who has failed
to file such report, that the following action shall be taken:
  (a) 	The Review Committee shall notify such judge, and the chief judge of
       the circuit or the chief judge of other courts who are members of the
       Conference of such fact who shall then request such judge to advise
        within 30 days that he is in compliance;
  (b) 	In the event such judge fails or refuses to advise that he has complied
       as in paragraph (a), the chief judge shall inform such judge that unless
        the judge advises within 60 days that he is in compliance, this fact will
        be published in the next report of the Judicial Conference;
  (c) 	If at the expiration of the OO-day period, the judge fails or declines to file
        the semi-annual report, the chief judge shall also request the judge to
        state whether he is or is not in compliance with the 1963 resolution; a
       failure or refusal so to state will likewi8e be published;
  (d) 	In the event the judge declines to make a report on grounds of conscience,
        he shall be advised that if desired such fact will be noted in the published
      report.

   INTERIM ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL 

                 ACTIVITIES 

  Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman, presented the report of the In­
terim Advisory Committee on Judicial Activities.
   The Conference discussed Judge Tuttle's report and resolved
that when an individual judge's report indicates to the Review
Committee that a specified aetivity may be one that should be
considered by the Interim Advisory Committee, the Review Com­
mittee is requested to suggest to such a judge that he make a formal
inquiry of that committee respecting such activity.
  The Conference voted further to authorize the Committee, when
answering questions from individual judges, to state whenever ap­
                                        25 

propriate what the applicable canons of judicial ethics provide and
also what is provided in the latest available draft of the proposed re­
port of the American Bar Association's special committee now
studying the question of judicial ethics, chaired by former Chief
Justice Roger J. Traynor.

       COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
  Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
Court Administration, presented the Committee's report to the
Conference.
                                 LEGISLATION

  The Conference approved and authorized the transmission to
the Congress of three bills, as follows:
  (1) 	 A bill to create the Office of Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice.
       This office would be designed to assist the Chief Justice in matters relat­
       ing solely to his ndministrative burdens, such ns those imposed upon him
      'as Ohairman of the Judicial Conference, Chairman of the Board of the
       Federal Judicial Center, and in his relationships with the federal judiciary
      ;generally ;
  (2) 	 A bill to permit a federal judge to serve as Director of the Administrative
       Office of the United States Courts, the Director of the Federal Judicial
       Center or as the proposed Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice,
       without loss of seniority or precedence in his own court;
  (3) 	A bill to establish a commission whose function would be to study the
       present division of the United States into several judicial circuits and to
       recommend such changes as may be appropriate for the expeditious and
       effective disposition of judicial business.
   The Conference approved in principle S. 4982, 9Ist Congress, a
bill referred for comment by the Senate Judiciary Committee
which would establish a Federal Judiciary Council which would be
in a positon to study and advise on the impact of legislation on
the federal courts.

DIVISION OF JURISDICTION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS

   Upon advice that the American Law Institute was not permitted
by its charter to make specific recommendations to the Congress,
the Conference agreed to authorize the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office to submit to the Congress for appropriate legislative
examination the several recommendations for legislative action
contained in the A.L.r. study on the divsion of jurisdiction between
state and federal courts.

                       LAND COMMISSIONERS

    Pursuant to the renewal of a request by the Department of Jus­
 tice that the responsibility for obtaining funds for compensation
 and expenses of commissioners appointed under Rule 71 (A) CH) of
 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure be transferred from the De­
 partment of Justice to the Administrative Office, the Committee
 created an ad hoc subcommittee to study this problem.
                                                                         I
                                                                         J
    The ad hoc committee had completed its study and was in agree­
 ment with a similar study made in 1961 by a subcommittee headed
 by Judge Stanley Barnes to the effect that the responsibility for
                                                                         j

 obtaining funds for commissioners appointed under Rule 71(A)
 (H) should be transferred to the Administrative Office. The ad hoc
 committee was in agreement that it was not appropriate for the
 Department of Justice as a pa,rty litigant and an interested party
 in these commissioner proceedings to be responsible for the obtain­
 ing of and paying out of money to pay court-appointed commis­
 sioners who hear and determine the litigated issues. The ad hoc
committee was further of the view that guidelines should be drafted
for the possible supervision of the use of funds by commissioners
appointed under Rule 71 (A) (H).
   The Committee recommended that the Department of Justice be
advised in response to its request that the Judicial Conference is,
willing to have the responsibility for obtaining funds for the com­
pensation and expenses of these commissioners transferred to the
Administrative Office provided the Department seeks and obtains
the approval thereof from the appropriating authorities and, sec­
ondly, should the transfer take place, a study be made of appro­
priate guidelines for and possible supervision of the use of the
fund by the judges who make such commissioner appointments.
   Upon the request of the Chairman of the Budget Committee, the
Conference voted to defer consideration of these recommendations
until its next session so that it might obtain the recommendation
of the Budget Committee.
                        JUDICIAL STATISTICS

   The Subcommittee on Judicial Statistics has requested the Ad­
ministrative Office to make further studies relating to the projection
of the needs of the courts of appeals in 1975. The subcominittee had
approved the new statistical profiles which have been prepared by
the Administrative Office.

                           SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

   Court Reporters.-The Committee recommended and the Con­
ference apPl'oved a composite plan prepared by the Subcommittee
on Supporting Personnel relating to the qualification and com­
pensation for official court reporters in the district courts. This plan
provides as follows:
qUALIFICATIONS AND COMPENSATION PLAN FOR OFFICIAL COURT
        REPORTERS, CNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS
 1. 	 An applicant for appointment hereafter as an official court reported in the
       United States district courts shall possess as a minimum requirement:
         (a) 	 At least four years of prime court reporting experience in the free
               lance field of service or service in the lower courts or a combination
               thereof;
         (b) 	 A certificate of proficiency from the National Shorthand Reportt'rs
               Association; or
         (0) 	 A certificate from the Administrative Office of the United States
               Courts stating that he has passed an examination conducted under
               the auspices of the Administrative Office.
      Such a qualified person shall, upon appointment, receive the starting salary
      for court reporters set by the Judicial Conference plus transcript fees;
 2. 	All official court reporters who have satIsfactorily served the United States
      dIstrict courts as official court reporters for 10 years shall receive a 10%
      increase over the starting salary set by the Judicial Conference for court
      reporters;
 3. 	A holder of a certificate of merit from the National Shorthand Reporters
      Association (or the equivalent therefor established by the Administrative
      Office) shall after five years of satIsfactory service as official court reporter
      receive a 10% increase over the starting salary set by the Judicial Conference
      for court reporters;
 4. 	 The recommendation of the employing court is prerequisite for advancement
      to the 10% salary increase. The salary rates above-mentioned may be
      adjusted upwards whenever there is a statutory pay increase for judiciary
       employees generally;
 5. 	All initial appoin,tments shall be on a probationary basis to be fixed by the
      employing court;
 6. 	This Plan shall be administered by the Director of the Administrative
      Office of the United States Courts, under the general direction and super·
      vision of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The requirements
      of Item 1, above, may be subject to modification wht're special problems
      exist.
  The Conference approved a recommendation that court reporters
overseas be allowed the usual cost-of-living allowance enjoyed by
other personnel of the courts in overseas areas.
  The Conference agreed to rescind the action taken at its March
1970 meeting authorizing the combination position of court re­
porter-secretary for the District of Idaho.
                                      28 

   The Conference further approved a recommendation that salaries
be withheld from court reporters who are delinquent in complying
with the Judicial Conference directive under the sta,tute to report.
annually their attendance and financial reports on Form JS 40
and that they shall be subject to the same penalty for failure to
supply the JS 40 form as now exists for failure to supply the AO
Form 88 relating to the furnishing of certificates and transcripts.
   Clerks' Ofjices-Courts of Appeals.-The Conference approved
a recommendation effecting t.he incorporation of an additional
managerial/supervisory grade below the chief deputy level for the
large and medium clerks' offices in the courts of appeals. This allows
for the following maximum classifications below the chief deputy
level:
   Darge Office: 

       Grades JSP-ll   ($12,615-$16,404) 

          and JSP-9    ($10,470-$13.611) 

   Medium Office: 

       Grades JSP-10   ($11,157-$14,973) 

          and JSP-8    ($ 9,494-$12,337) 

   Small Office: 

       Grade JSP-9     ($10,470--$13,611) 

This will permit the continuation of categorization of the courts
of appeals clerks' offices as large, medium and small, subject to
review by the Judicial Conference whenever requested by a court
of appeals. This assignment is based upon factors such as the
volume of business, the number of judges on the court and the
size of the staff of the clerk's office.
   Libraria17r-Courts of Appeals.-A recommendation that the
position of an assistant or second-ranking librarian in the courts of
appeals now limited to Grade JSP-7 be upgraded to JSP-9 when­
ever the incumbent qualifies on the strength of credentials and
experience applicable to the higher grade was approved by the
Conference. Judge Ainsworth agreed that the Subcommittee on
Supporting Personnel would study a recommendation of a member
of the Conference for a possible reclassification to Grade JSP-lO
for the librarian for the combined library of the Court of Appeals
of the Ninth Circuit at Los Angeles and the District Court for the
Central District of California.
   Clerks' Ofjices.-Judge Ainsworth agreed to refer to the Sub­
committee on Supporting Personnel a study of the need of addi­
tional personnel for the clerks' offices in the district courts occa­
                                            29 


      sioned by the new reporting obligations required in connection
      with the administration and operation of the jury system.
         Part-Time Employees.-The Conference approved a recommen­
      dation that part-time employees in the United States courts be
      brought under the within grade promotional plan for salary step
      increases upon the completion of required periods of service.

                                      RESOLUTION

         Judge Ainsworth reported to the Conference that the Commit­
      tee had taken note of the fact that Judge John Biggs, Jr., who had
      been the first Chairman of the Committee and associated with the
      Committee until the close of 1970, had at his request been relieved
      of his duties as a member of the Committee on Court Administra­
      tion. As a result, the Committee adopted the following resolution:
        Judge John Biggs, Jr., has been a member 1()f the Committee on Court Admin­
      istration of the Judicial Conference of the United States from its creation
      in 1955 to his voluntary retirement in 1971. Appointed as the first Chairman of
      this Committee when it was organized, then Chief Judge Biggs presided over
      and directed Committee deliberations for some fourteen years. He then relin­
      quished the chairmanship but oontinued until 1971 ,as an invaluable Committee
      member, making available to his colleagues his clear understanding and cyclo­
      pedic knowledge of the work and history of the Judicial Conference and its
,"'   committees. The effectiveness of the Committee on Court Administration
      throughout its existence has reflected his judgment, understanding, strong
      leadership and indefatigable labor. He became both a Nestor whQ led his Com­
      mittee wiseIyand an Atlas who carried many burdens of the Judicial Confer­
      ence on his shoulders.
        At this first meeting since his retirement, we, the members of the Committee
      on Court Administration, express to Senior Circuit Judge John Biggs, Jr., our
      great esteem and unending gratitude, sentiments which we know are shared by
      the entire federal judiciary.
        This Resolution shall be incorporated in the Minutes of this Committee and
      in its report to the Judicial Conference and also shall be transmitted to
      Judge Biggs.

                      COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
        Judge Carl A. Weinman, Chairman of the Committee on the
      Budget, advised the Conference that the hearings before the Sub­
      committee of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of
      Representatives had just been concluded. Hearings before the
      Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations are not anticipated for
      several weeks. In discussing the hearings on the request for the
      appropriation to the judiciary, Judge Weinfeld pointed out the
      United States increase in projected work of the United States
                                 30 


marshals and U.S. Attorneys contained in the request of the De­
partment of Justice for appropriations for fiscal year 1972.

                      SPECIAL COMMITTEE
   Judge Edward A. Tamm, Chairman of a special committee
named by the Chief Justice to study matters relating to the secu­
rity of court houses and federal judges, discussed the work of his
Committee with the Conference and noted that the Administrative
Office was working in close collaboration with other government
agencies in connection with the over-all problems of security.

PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS
  The Conference approved the pretermission of terms of courts
of appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, for those sessions of the
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to be held at Asheville,
North Carolina, and those terms of the Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit which might be held in places other than St. Louis
prior to the next session of the Conference.
           RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action         f


on matters considered at this session where necessary for legislative
or administrative action.
                                         WARREN E. BURGER,
                               Chief Justice of the United States.
