REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
     OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   Mr. Kirks, Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts, reported to the Conference on the judicial business
of the United States courts in fiscal year 1971.
   The annual report of the Director shows a large increase during
the year in the caseloads of the United States courts of appeals
and the United States district courts across the country. Appeals
to the courts of appeals increased 10 percent in the year ending
June 30, 1971, thus reaching an all-time high of 12,718. Civil and
criminal cases filed in the United States district courts increased in
the same year nine percent to an all-time high of 136,553. Mr. Kirks
emphasized that the backlog of civil and criminal cases in the dis- ,
                                       39 


    trict courts now exceeds 124,000, an increase of nine percent over
    the prior year, although civil cases on the average reached trial
(   in the district courts in 11 months in 1971 as compared with an
    interval of 12 months in 1970 and 13 months in 1969.
       The report shows that appeals in the United States courts of
    appeals are on the increase in civil rights cases, in suits by state and
    federal prisoners and in narcotics and bank robbery cases. A large
    part of the increase in criminal cases in the district courts is at­
    tributable to embezzlement, bank robberies and theft, violations
    of the narcotics laws and violations of the Selective Service Act.
       The Conference authorized the Director to release immediately
    the preliminary edition of the annual report and to revise and
    supplement the final printed edition.
       COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                    CRIMINAL LAW
     Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli, Chairman, presented the report of the
    Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.

                            SPEEDY TRIAL LEGISLATION

       The Conference considered two bills referred by the Rouse Judici­
    ary Committee, R.R. 6045 and R.R. 7108. The Conference had
     considered the substance of these bills at the March 1970 session
     (Conf. Rept., p. 17), and at that time disapproved the portions of
    the bills requiring trial within 120 days or in cases of crimes of
    violence within 60 days and the portion of the bill relating to
    amendments to the Bail Reform Act having to do with pretrial
    service agencies. The Conference adhered to its previous position
    and disapproved Title I of R.R. 6045 and Titles I and II of R.R.
    7108. While the Conference approved the objectives of Title II of
    H.R. 6045 and Title III of R.R. 7108, it took the position that the
    services which should be performed through pretrial agencies as
    provided in the bills could be more effectively performed and ad­
    ministered through the probation officers of each court provided
    Congress furnishes the necessary funding for the additional pro­
    bation officers needed to render these services and also provided
    that the operation and contracting for the operation of such facili­
    ties as halfway houses or community treatment centers are made
    executive functions to be performed by an executive branch agency.

   The Conference next considered an amendment to the probation
law to extend the present setting aside of convictions as outlined
in 18 U.S.C. 5021 (b) to all probationers regardless of age at the
time of conviction. This extension would be available at the discre­
tion of the court without any special finding of eligibility at the
time of sentence. While the Conference agreed as to the rehabilita­
tion benefits that might accrue to some probationers, it took the
position that it would not be appropriate to recommend such
legislation of general application at this time.
                         BAIL REFORM ACT

  -In considering H.R. 8550, 92d Congress, which would amend
the Bail Reform Act to authorize consideration of danger to other
persons or the community in setting conditions of release, to au­
thorize revocation of pretrial release for persons who violate their
release conditions, intimidate witnesses or juror:s or commit new
offenses, the Conference approved the bill provided the proposed
mandatory minimum sentencing provisions contained in Section
3150 and Section 3150D are deleted. The Conference reaffirmed its
disapproval of mandatory minimum sentences, particularly when ;
applied to defendants who may be in default of appearance for a .
myriad of reasons requiring some flexibility in applying penalties
therefor.
                          HABEAS CoRPUS

   The Conference noted S. 2090, 92d Congress, which would amend
28 U.S.C. 2241 (d) so that a district court may not transfer an appli­
cation for a writ ofhabeas corpus to another district having con­
current jurisdiction. The Conference in disapproving this legisla­
tive proposal pointed to the value of permitting transfers as
provided in Section 2241 (d) which has been clearly demonstrated
in states having multiple federal districts.
CoMMITMENT OF PERSONS ACQUITTED              ON THE GROUNDS        OF
                             INSANITY

   The Conference noted that at its October 1969 session it had
approved and recommended to the Congress enactment of legis­
lation prepared by an interdepartmental group which constituted
an entire revision of Chapter 313 of Title 18, United States Code
(Conf. Rept., p. 61). The Conference noted that federal power to
                                      41 


    commit persons acquitted on the grounds of insanity through civil
    process is urgently needed and reaffirmed its approval of the pro­
    posed revision of Chapter 313.
     ApPEAL BY A DEFENDANT FOLLOWING ENTRY OF A GUILTY PLEA

       The Conference at its October 1970 session (Conf. Rept., p. 57)
    approved proposed legislation to provide that a defendant who
    has pleaded guilty to an offense may appeal from a denial of his
    motion made before entry of such plea of guilty for the return of
    seized property or for the suppression of evidence, with a proviso
    that a judge continuing the motion must certify that the appeal
    raises a substantial question. The proposed bill would require that
    the appeal be taken within ten day days of the entry of judgment.
    The Conference reaffirmed its approval of this legislative proposaL

                            OTHER LEGISLATION

       The Conference noted two bills which in its opinion involved
    matters of legislative policy and, accordingly, took no action: (1)
    H.R. 191, entitled Criminal Injuries Compensation Act and (2)
    S. 1121, a bill calling for reform of the Federal Elective Process.

(         COMMITrEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM

     The Committee's report to the Conference was presented by its
    Chairman, Judge Irving R. Kaufman.
                              SIZE OF JLTRIES

       The Conference first considered H.R. 7800 which would reduce
    the size of juries in civil and criminal cases. The Conference decided
    to reaffirm the resolution adopted at its March 1971 session approv­
    ing in principle a reduction in the size of juries in civil trials in
    United States district courts. The Conference took no action ",rith
    respect to the portion of the bill relating to the size of juries in
    criminal cases since this is a matter which will require the study of
    the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules and other appropriate
    committees of the Conference.

                        PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES

       The Conference agreed to the proposal of the Committee to
    refer to the Committee on the Rules of Practice and Procedure
(   for appropriate study the proposition that the number of peremp­
                                   42 


tory challenges in capital cases be fixed at twelve for each side, in
other felony cases at five and in misdemeanors at two and for good
cause shown to grant such additional challenges as the court in its
discretion shall permit.

   REDUCTION OF ELIGIBILITY AGE FOR FEDERAL JURY SmVICE

   The Conference next considered S. 1975 and H.R. 8829, both
of which would result in the reduction of the eligibility age for
federal jury service from 21 years to 18 years. The Conference
agreed to ask for an expression of the views of the Committee on
Court Administration on this matter and also ask for an expres­
sion from the Administrative Office as to how this proposed legis­
lation would affect the administrative mechanism currently in
operation in connection with the Jury Selection and Service Act of
1968.
                       UTILIZATION OF JURORS

   The Committee noted that a four-month in depth study of
juror utilization in the Southern District of New York had been
undertaken under the joint auspices of the Institute of Judicial
Administration and the Federal Judicial Center. The Conference
agreed that the suggestion contained in the report of this survey I
should be implemented in any judicial district where, in the I
opinion of the judges, the suggestion would improve juror usage
efficiency, thus tending to eliminate the frustrating experience of
citizens summoned to civic duty who must wait long hours in the
court house, often in vain.
                             LEXHSLATION

   The Conference noted and voted its disapproval of H.R. 1615
which would, in effect, call for feder,al supervision of state jury selec­
tion. The Conference noted the Committee report which pointed
to the fact that this legislation would establish a tremendously
costly bureaucratic supervisory structure and add to the respon­
sibilities of federal courts substantially as well as increase the per
diem cost of jurors.
   The Conference voted its approval of H.R. 2589 which would
make an answer to the race question on the federal juror ques­
tionnaire form mandatory. This is in furtherance of Conference
action at the September 1969 session (Conf. Rept., p. 66).

        COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE BANK­
(                     RUPrCY SYSTEM
          Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman, presented the Committee's
        report to the Conference.

                     SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

     The Committee had considered the recommendations contained
  in the survey report of the Director of the Administrative Office,
  dated September 2, 1971, as well as the recommendations of the
  circuit councils and district judges concerned for the authoriza­
  tion of new six-year terms for seven referee positions to become va­
  cant by expiration of term, for increases in salaries of one part-time
  and five full-time referee positions, to increase one part-time referee
  position to full-time service, to authorize one additional part-time
  referee position, to establish district-wide concurrent jurisdiction
  for the referees of the Middle District of Florida and for the referees
  of the Eastern District of Missouri in the Western District of Mis­
  souri SlIld to authorize changes in the regular places of office of
  referees in two districts. The Conference approved the Committee
  report and recommendations, all to be effective November 1, 1971,
C unless otherwise indicated, subject to the availability of funds.

                                     ApPROPRIATIONS

       The Conference noted that the receipts into the Referees' Salary
     and Expense Fund in 1973 are estimated at $13,000,000 or about
     $6,000,000 less than the anticipated expenditures. This latter
     amount will have to be appropriated out of general funds of the
     Treasury as provided in 4Oc( 4) of the Bankruptcy Act. The 1973
     estimate for salaries of referees, as approved by the Conference,
     contains an item of increase totaling $234,000 to provide for addi­
     tional referee positions and salary increases approved by the Judi­
     cial Conference during calendar year 1971.

                  AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS
  The audit of statistical reports of closed bankruptcy cases for
the previous six months disclosed 183 possible errors. Letters have
been written to make the necessary adjustment of payments to and
from the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund or to secure the re­
covery of excess trustee commissions for the benefit of creditors
and for the correction of other errors.

                   MATTERS UNDER SUBMISSION
  Of 206 referees reporting to the Bankruptcy Division, 175 had no
matters under advisement for longer than 60 days. The remaining
31 referees had a total of 65 matters which had been pending with
all briefs filed for 60 days or longer.

                       PETITIONS FOR REVIEW
   Pursuant to previous Conference action, the Bankruptcy Divi­
sion obtains reports semi-annually from the referees on the number
of petitions to review orders of referees pending before district
judges. The first reports, made as of June 30, 1971, listed 114 peti­
tions for review pending before district judges 00 days or longer.

                       CRAPrER XIII CASES
   The Conference noted the report of the Administrative Office that
in fiscal year 197!J a total of 30,904 cases were filed under Chapter
XIII, an increase of 1.3 percent over the total filed in fiscal year
1970. Substantial increases in the use of the wage-earners plan
were noted in the Southern District of California, Northern Dis­
trict of Illinois, Western Distriot of New York and the Middle Dis­
trict of North Carolina. Decreases were noted in the Eastern Dis­
trict of Michigan and in all Districts of Tennessee.

COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
           PROBATION SYSTEM
 The report of the Probation Committee was presented by its
Chairman, Judge Francis L. Van Dusen.

                 NUMBER OF PROBATION OFFICERS
   The Conference agreed with the recommendation of the Proba­
tion Committee that the 1973 budget seek funds for 348 addi­            f
                                  47 

tional probation officer positions. This includes the 320 positions
approved for fiscal year 1973 and 28 positions disallowed by the
Congress for fiscal year 1972. In so doing, the Conference noted
that in the last fiscal year the number of cases under supervision
of the probation service increased by more than 4,000. Based on
the filings of new criminal cases projected by the Department of
Justice for the current year the number of persons granted proba­
tion this year may exceed last year's by as much as 60 percent.
In addition, the Board of Parole has established new standards,
compliance with which will require additional probation officers.
Further, both the Bureau of Prisons and the Board of Parole have
recommended that a probation officer supervise no more than 25
releasees under Title II of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act
of 1966. This constitutes a further drain on the present staff.
   The Conference took note of the fact that in 1967 the President's
Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice
recommended that the number of probation and parole cases should
not exceed 35 per officer. The average in the probation system at
the end of the last fiscal year was 69, in addition to the investigative
duties placed upon the federal probation service.
                             LEGISLATION

   In light of Committee recommendations, the Qonference took
the following action with regard to H.R. 7105, a bill styled as the
Correctional Service Improvement Act:
   Title I: The Conference approved in principle the provisions
of this title concerning establishment of correctional centers for
federal offenders insofar as the provisions of this title affect the
federal judiciary.
     Title II: The Conference disapproved section 201 of this title
because of the mandated, as opposed to the advisory, powers
granted to the proposed council. The Conference believes that the
present law is adequate in this regard.
  Title III: The Conference disapproved this title insofar as it
affects the federal judiciary and supporting personnel since it con­
tains an unwise duplication of functions granted to the Federal
Judicial Center and since it is deemed unwise that the Executive
Branch should train federal judges and judicial personnel.
  Title IV: The Conference noted no objection to this title.


     45S-M7-72-S
                                48 

   Title V: The C{)nference believes that this recommendation
relating to a redraft of Chapter 313, as reflected in the report of
the Criminal Law Committee, is preferable to the provisions of
title V.
   The Conference did not recommend H.R. 4135, a bill relating to
the killing or assaulting of law enforcement officers inasmuch as it
believes that H.R. 8194 and S. 2293 offer broader protection for
probation officers. The two latter bills are substantially identical
to H.R. 17081 of the 91st Congress, previously approved by the
Conference (see Conf. Rept., March 1970, p. 28).
   The Conference next examined a draft bill offered by the Office
of Management and Budget to amend Title 18 to authorize the
Attorney General to provide care for narcotic addicts who are
placed on probation, released on parole or mandatorily released.
The Conference expressed its approval of this draft bill.
    COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  The report of the Intercircuit Assignment Committee was pre­
sented by its Chairman, Judge Roy L. Harper.
  The Conference noted that during the period from February 1,
W71 to September 1, 1971 the Intercircuit Assignment Committee
recommended 47 assignments to be undertaken by 34 judges-four
circuit judges in active status, four senior circuit judges, seven
district judges 'in active status and 11 senior district judges. Two
active judges of the Court of Claims and two active judges of the
Customs Court each carried out one assignment while one assign­
ment each was carried out by two senior judges of the Court of
Claims and one senior judge of the Customs Court. A retired
Supreme Court Justice participated in three assignments.
  During the reporting period in question there were 17 assign­
ments to the circuit courts of appeals, two assignments to the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and 28 assignments to the
district courts.
      COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE Ii'EDERAL 

               MAGISTRATES ACT 

  Judge Charles M. Metzner, Chairman of the Committee to Im­
plement the Federal Magistrates Act, presented the report of the
Committee.

                              MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

   The Conference at its March 1971 session (Con£. Rept., p. 16)
authorized its Executive Committee to "act for the Conference
between sessions on any such matters which in the view of the
Magistrates Committee require immediate action." Upon recom­
mendation of the Committee the Conference ratified the follow­
ing action regarding magistrate positions taken by the Executive
Committee since 'the last session ofthe Conference:

   The Committee reported that it had considered various requests
for additional magistrate positions, changes in salaries and ar­
rangements, and a change in the official location of one magistrate
position. These requests had also been considered by the judicial
councils of the circuits. In accordance with the recommendations
of the Committee the Conference approved the following changes
in the numbers, locations, arrangements, and salaries of magistrates
and directed that these changes be made effective at such time as
appropriated funds are available.

                     ASSIGNMENT OF MAGISTRATES

   H.R. 9180, 92d Congress, would authorize the temporary asSIgn­
ment of a United States magistrate from one jurisdiction to another
in an emergency situation upon the approval of the chief judges of
the district courts ooncerned. The assignment would become effec­
tive upon the entry of an order in the transferee district specifying
the emergency, the duration of the assignment and the duties to be
performed. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference voted to approve the bill.
PREPARATION OF DOCUMENTS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

   The Committee reported that in some districts personnel of both
full-time and part-time magistrates were preparing and typing
complaints, affidavits, applications for search warrants, etc. for law
enforcement officers. It was the view of the Committee that law
enforcement officers should prepare their own complaints and af­
fidavits and appear before United States magistrates with com­
pleted documents, and further that neither the magistrate nor his
staff should engage in the preparation of these materials. Accord­
ingly, the Committee recommended and the Conference approved
this procedure as a matter of policy.
                      EMPLOYEES OF MAGISTRATES

  Several United States magistrates have requested authodty to
appoint special employees, including law clerks, interpreters, and
court reporters. It was the view of the Committee that law clerks
should not be provided for magistrates and that interpreters should
be furnished by the agencies involved in the proceedings before the
magistrates. Upon recommendation of the Committee the Confer­
ence directed that law clerks and interpreters not be authorized for
magistra.tes.
                                 54 


   The Committee reported that it had reserved for further study
the question whether court reporters should be furnished to magis­
trates inasmuch as sound recording equipment seems to be working
well.
                       REVISION Ol!' FORMS

   The Committee submitted to the Conference a revised docket
sheet for United States magistrates, developed in the Administra­
tive Office, which is intended to replace the three docket sheets, or
record of proceedings, formerly used by United States commission­
ers. The docket sheet would be printed in three parts with carbon
interleaves, including one copy to be provided to the United States
attorney in lieu of a separate report now prepared on a Department
of Justice form.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Administrative Of·
fice was authorized to circulate this new form among the full-time
United States magistrates for their suggestions, to make revisions
in the form as may be deemed appropriate in the light of the sug­
gestions received, and to issue the revised form as a standard docket
sheet in accordance with the authority contained in Rule 55, Fed­
eral Rules of Criminal Procedure.
                           JURISDICTION

   Several district courts have authorized magistrates to conduct
post-indictment arraignments of defendants and in some instances
to take not guilty pleas. Inquiry was also received concerning the
views of the Committee as to the propriety of United States magis­
trates accepting guilty pleas in felony cases and in misdemeanor
cases beyond their trial jurisdiction. The Committee reported its
firm opposition to the acceptance of guilty pleas in these cases by
United States magistrates, since the plea occurs at a critical stage
of criminal proceedings. However, the Committee found no sub­
stantive objection to the acceptance of a not guilty plea by a
United States magistrate in any case.
   The Committee further reported that it had requested the Ad­
ministrative Office to undertake a study of the trial jurisdiction of
United States magistrates under 18 U.S.C. 3401, particularly with
respect to increasing trial jurisdiction of misdemeanors where the
fine does not exceed $5,000, or in the alternative, that magistrates
be authorized to try all misdemeanor cases with specific exceptions
based on policy considerations which might be noted in the statute.
A report will be made to the next session ofthe Conference.

               AT'l'ENDANCE AT CIRCUIT CONFERENCES

    Several magistrates had inquired about the possibility of their
 attendance at Judicial Conferences of the Circuits in an official
 capacity, with expenses paid. Under existing provisions of law, 28
 U.S.C. 333, attendance at circuit conferences is limited to circuit
 and district judges of the circuit. The court of appeals for each cir­
 cuit may also provide by its rules for representation and active par­
 ticipation at the circuit conference by members of the bar of the
 circuit to attend at their own expense. At the present time referees
 in bankruptcy, probation officers, and clerks of court are not au­
 thorized to attend circuit conferences in an official capacity. The
 Committee reported its unanimous view that magistrates should
 not be made official members of the circuit conferences.

     COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                 JUSTICE ACT 

    Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman, presented the report of the
 Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act.
    The Conference noted and approved for distribution the report
 of the Director of the Administrative Office on appointments and
 payments made under the Criminal Justice Act through June 30,
 1971. In presenting this report to the Conference Judge Hastings
 pointed out that because of the time lag-often more than a year
 if a trial is involved-between the filing of the notice of appoint­
 ment and the submission of a voucher to the Administrative Office,
 the statistics for the last two years are never a complete reflection
 of the activities under the Criminal Justice Act in those years.
 Judge Hastings pointed out further that the current statistical re­
 port does not reflect activities under the amendments to the Crimi­
 nal Justice Act which became effective on February 11, 1971. The
 Director's report on this subject is attached to the final printed re­
 port of the proceedings of the Judicial Conference in 1971 and the
 annual report of the Director for that year.

                         FEDERAL PuBLIC DEFENDERS

    The Conference noted that the first federal public defender
  organization authorized by the amendments to the Criminal Justice
  Act was established in the District of Arizona on April 30, 1971.
  Since that time six additional pUblic defender organizations have
  been established in the Northern District of California, Central
. District of Californial Eastern District of California, District of
      453i--047-72---4
                                       56 

New Mexico, Southern District of Florida and the Western District
of Missouri.

               CoMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS

  The Conference was advised that three community defender
organizations have applied for and received grants under the Crimi­
nal Justice Act. The Act provides that upon application an organi­
zation may, to the extent approved by the Judicial Conference of
the United States,
      (i) 	receive an initial grant for expenses necessary to establish
           the organization; and
     (ii) in lieu of payments under subsection 	(d) or (e) receive
           periodic sustaining grants to provide for representation
           and other expenses pursuant to this section.
  The applications, as recommended by the Conference committee,
were previously approved by the Executive Committee of the
Conference and are paid or being paid as follows:
    (1) Application for 	sustaining grant in the sum of $135,000 to the I<'ederal
         Defender Program, Inc., Northern District of Illinois, for the fiscal
        year 1972;
    (2) 	Application for an initial grant in the sum of $18,000 for a two-month
         period and a sustaining grant of $91,000 for the period October 1, 1971
        to June 30, 1972 to Legal Aid and Defender Association of Detroit,
        Eastern District of Michigan;
    (3) Application for a non-renewable grant in the sum of $66,649 to Federal
        Defenders of San Diego, Inc., covering a three-month period commenc­
        ing July 1, 1971, and ending September 30, 1971.

COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
   Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on the Rules
of Practice and Procedure, presented the Committee's report.

          LEGISLATION TO MODIFY RULE-MAKING POWER

   The Conference was advised that the Committee on the Judici­
ary of the Senate has requested its views on S. 2432, 92nd Congress,
introduced by Senator McClellan and six other senators, which
would modify sections 3771 and 3772 of title 18 and sections 2072
and 2075 of title 28, United States Code. The principal modifica­
tions proposed are three:
   (1) 	to provide that rules when pr(lmulgated by the Oourt and reported
        to the Congress at or after thebegtnnlng of a regular seSSion, but not
       later than the first of May, shall not take ettect until the close of the
        session or such 'later date as the Court may fix;
                                        57 

    (2) 	to authorize either House of Congress to disapprove, in whole or in
         part, a rule promulgated hy the Court and reported to the Congress,
          provided only that the rejection takes place during the session at which
         the rule is reported; and
    (S) 	 to introduce into section 3772 of title 18 for the first time the require­
          ment that rules drafted by the Supreme Court under the authority of
         that seetion must be reported to the Congress and may not take effect
         until a speeified time after such reporting.
    The Conference agreed that the bill, if enacted, would seriously
restrict the rule-making power of the Supreme Court. The prohibi­
 tion against making a rule effective prior to the adjournment of the
Congressional session at which it is reported, together with the
retention of the requirement that the rule must be reported to
 Congress on or before May 1, would render it virtually impossible
 for the Court to deal with an emergency situation requiring prompt
adoption or amendment of a rule. While Congress in theory has set
August 1 as its adjournment date, it is the fact that it is seldom
able to adjourn until very near the commencement of its new session
in January. Moreover, if the rules adopted are of a novel or con­
troversial character the Court often has delayed the effective date
for substantially more than ninety days, so as to give Congress more
time to consider them before they become effective, and doubtless
it will continue this practice. Finally, the Conference agreed that
Congress may now at any time, after as well as before the effective
date, repeal or modify in whole or in part any rule promUlgated by
the Court which it disapproves.
   The Conference is of the view that the provision authorizing
a single House of Congress to reject a rule, in whole or in part,
,vithout the concurrence of the other House, would make it possi­
ble for one House to reject a rule of which the other House ap­
proves, thus placing the Court in the difficult position of not being
able to meet what might be an important or, indeed, urgent
problem except by a rule which would likely be rejected by one
House or the other. It was agreed that in a matter as.vital to the
proper operation of the courts as procedural rule-making, the
Supreme Court, which has been properly given primary responsi­
bility, is entitled to have any action by Congress in this field take
the form of binding law and not mere negative reaction from a
single House. Judicial rule-making is quite different in character
from a proposal to reorganize an executive department, since the
latter involves, essentially, statutory amendments.
                                      58
  The proposal to subject rules of criminal procedure after verdict
and on appeal to the reporting procedure is of lesser significance,
but the Conference perceived no reason for imposing these require­
ments at this time. It was therefore voted to disapprove S. 2432.
                         ApPROPRIATION PROVISO

  Ever since the inception of the rules study program of the J udicia.l
Conference the annual appropriation acts for the judiciary which
provide the funds for the study in the appropriation item to the
Administrative Office have contained the following proviso to that
particular item:
   Provided, That not to exceed $90,000 of the appropriiltions contained in this
title shall be available for the study of rules of practice and procedure.
   Since the Htitle" referred to in this proviso can only be "Title
IV-The Judiciary" of the appropriation act, which title includes
the Administrative Office item, the effect of the proviso is to limit to
$90,000 the total amount expended on the rules program, not only
for the expenses paid out of the Administrative Office appropriation
but also for the travel expenses of judges and referees in bankruptcy
to committee meetings which are paid out of appropriations con­
tained in other items of the title.
   Although the $90,000 limitation has remained constant, the cost
of carrying on the program has increased over the years and in
recent years it has only been by the most rigid economy and some
curtailment of the programs in the latter part of ea~h fiscal year
that the work has been carried on.
   It has never been possible to make any general increases in the
all too modest compensation paid to the reporters to the advisory                      (
committees whose distinguished work has been to so great a degree
responsible for the excellence of the rules which have been formu­
lated and adopted.
   During the fiscal year ended June 30,1970 the amount spent for
                                                                                   I
                                                                                   ;




the travel of judges and referees in connection with the program
was $10,242. If the appropriation proviso were to be modified so
as to apply only to the Administrative Office appropriation item,
and accordingly did not include judges' and referees' travel, the
additional sum of $10,000 would be made available for the work
of the program, an increase very badly needed as we look forward
to greater activity by the Advisory Committees on Civil and Crim­
inal Rules. This limitation on the travel of judges and referees is
                                     59 

in practice difficult for the Administrative Office to administer,
since both judges and referees when in Washington for rules com­
mittee meetings very frequently transact other necessary official
business there, thus saving time and money.
   According1y, the Conference agreed that in the forthcoming
budget for the judiciary Congress be requested to change the
proviso language so as to read:
   Provided, That not to exceed $00,000 of the appropriation contained in this
item shall be available for the study of rules of practice and pl'OC'edul'e.

                            ApPELLATE RULES

   I t has now been more than three years since the Federal Rules
of Appellate Procedure went into effect to govern the procedure in
the United States courts of appeals. A body of experience under
the rules has been built up, the various courts of appeals are ex­
perimenting with various ways of further improving and expedit­
ing their procedure and suggestions in this regard are coming to
the standing committee from various sources. The Conference
agreed, therefore, that the Chief Justice be authorized to appoint a
new Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules and a reporter to the
committee.
                           ADMIRALTY RULES

  Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Admiralty
Rules has informally decided not to proceed with a revision of the
Supplemental Admiralty Rules at this time. There is apparently
no serious complaint from the bench or bar with respect to the
operation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Supple­
mental Admiralty Rules in maritime cases.

                          BANKRUPTCY RULES

  The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules held three meet­
ings during the year, the Conference was advised. In March 1971
the standing committee published and circulated to the bench and
bar for comments the Advisory Committee's preliminary draft of
rules and official forms under Chapters I to VII of the Bankruptcy
Act (ordinary bankruptcy). All comments with respect to the draft
are to be in the committee's hands by April 1, 1972 so that a final
definitive draft may be prepared and submitted to the Conference
next fall.
                                      60
  The Conference noted that the Advisory Committee has also
completed a preliminary draft of rules and forms under Chapter
XIII of the Bankruptcy Act and this draft is now in the hands of
the Government Printing Office for printing. The Committee is
continuing its work on rules under Chapters X and XI of the Act
and plans to prepare rules for all the remaining debtor relief and
rehabilitation chapters as soon as practicable.

                                CIVIL RULES

    The newly reconstituted Advisory Committee on Civil Rules
met under the chairmanship of Judge Elbert P. Tuttle on Septem­                    J
                                                                                   \,
ber 21, 1971. The Chief Justice has appointed Professor Bernard J.
Ward as repmter to the Committee. The Committee reports that
it is beginning the study of the operation of Rule 23, Class Actions,
Rule 16, Pretrial Procedure, and methods of accelerating judg­
ments. Pursuant to the request of the Conference at its session in
March 1971 (Conf. Rept.,pp. 5-6) the Committee considered
whether a reduction in the size of civil juries and an accompanying
diminution in the number of peremptory challenges should be
accomplished by procedural rule or by statute. Judge Maris stated
that the Advisory Committee adopted the following resolution on
the subject, with which the Conference concurred:
   WHEREAS, the Judicial Conference has approved in principal a reduction
in the size of juries in civil trials in the District Courtso! the United States
and an accompanying diminution in the number of peremptory challenges to
be allowed; and
   WHEREAS, the Conference has referred to the Committee on the Operation
of the Jury System and this Committee the means of effectuating those objec­
tives, i.e., whether by procedural rule or statute;
   Therefore, BE IT RESOLVED, That in the opinion of the Advisory Committee
on Civil Rules the better method of effectuating the proposals would be by
                                                                                   I

                             CRIMINAL RULES
                                                                                   J
  The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules met during the
year in June 1970 and January 1971 and, under the chairmanship
of its newly appointed chairman, Judge J. Edward Lumbard, in
September 1971. It was noted that in January 1970 the standing
committee published to the bench and bar the Advisory Commit­
tee's preliminary draft of proposed amendments to a number of
the criminal rules and in April 1971 a draft of additional amend­
                                        61 

ments approved by the Advisory Committee at its January 1971
meeting was also published. At the same meeting two alternative
drafts of a proposed amendment to Criminal Rule 45, imposing
time limits for the disposition of criminal cases, were prepared
and were published to the bench and bar in March 1971 with the
request, in view of the urgency of the problem, that comments be
sent in prior to July 1, 1971.
   The Advisory Committee at its meeting in September 1971,
after considering the comments received from the bench and bar,
approved Alternative Draft No.1 and the standing committee
concurred in this proposal to require each district court to adopt
a plan, with the approval of a reviewing panel c~:msisting of the
members of the judicial council of the circuit and the chief judge
of the district court.
   The Conference approved for transmittal to the Supreme Court
the amendment proposed by Alternative No.1 and agreed that it
be added to Criminal Rule 50 as subdivision (b) rather than to
Rule 45 as subdivision (f). The Conference agreed that the time
for filing the plans should be changed from 30 to 90 days and
agreed to recommend to the Supreme Court that the order promul­
gating the rule providing that the effective date be October 1, 1972.
                 RESOLUTION OF EXPEDITING ApPEALS
  The C{)nference expressed the view that the causes of delay in
the final disposition of cases should be treated at all levels, and
so it was agreed to recommend that each judicial council should
urge that appeals be expedited and that each circuit should develop
plans to perfect appeals with less than a full transcript where
possible, consistent with the interests of justice. Likewise, it was
agreed that the counsel who tried the case should normally handle
the appeal. After considerable discussion, the following resolution
was approved for transmittal to all federal judges:
  The Conference believes the causes of delay in the final disposition of crim­
inal cases should be treated simultaneously at all levels and that rules or proce­
dures to expedite trials without expediting disposition of appeals will not alone
afford satisfactory solutions. The Conference is aware of the multiple causes of
delay in the disposition of appeals including the increasing volume of appeals
under the Criminal Justice Act, the tendency to demand fUll transcripts of trials,
especially when new counsel is apPOinted on appeal, the difficulty of promptly
securing transcripts from court reporters, and other factors.
  It is the sense of the Conference that a substantial number of criminal ap­
peals can be fairly conducted without a full transcript of all <testimony and
proceedings.
                                         62 

   The Conference is particularly concerned about (a) delay in disposition of
cases in which an accused is in custody pending trial. and in which a convicted
person is in custody pending appeal; and (h) delays in disposition of trials and
appeals in which an accused or convicted person is at large pending trial or
appeal, where there is a risk of repeated criminal conduct, the prohabilil-y of
flight, or other danger to the community.
   Against this background and having in mind the action of the Conference
today in requesting the Supreme Court to approve the proposed rule 50(b) of
Federal Criminal Procedure, requiring District Courts to develop plans for
speedy trials in criminal cases, it is resolved and recommended:
   1. that each Court of Appeals should forthwith develop a plan to expedite
the processing of criminal appeals to the end that such appeals shall he speedily
heard and that, if the conviction is affirmed, the sentence will be speedily carried
out;
   2. that among other methods, the processing of appeals should he expedited
by such steps as the following:
      (a) 	Except in unusual circumstances and for good cause shown, trial
           counsel should be appointed to conduct all appeals falling under the
           Criminal Justice Act;
      (b) 	All counsel should be required to exhaust all efforts to perfect appeals
           without full trial transcripts, by use of such traditional devices as prep­
           aration of an agreed statement or other summary of the evidence;
      (c) 	Courts should encourage counsel to utilize the provision of the Federal
           Rules of Appellate Procedure dispensing with printed briefs;
      (d) 	Courts should study methods designed ,to limit oral arguments to cases
           where this would assist the court and the writing of opinions to cases
           involving serious issues oflaw.
   Adopted by the Judicial Conference of the United States this 29th day of
October, 1971.
   The Director of the Administrative Office is instrudted to furnish copies of
this Resolution to all federal judges without awaiting publication of the pro­
ceedings of the Conference.

                             RULES OF EVIDENCE

     The draft of Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and
  Magistrates which was approved by the Conference at the October
  1970 session (Conf. Rept., p. 72) and forwarded to the Supreme
  Court, was subsequently returned by the Court for republication
  in its final form and further study by the Advisory Committee and
  the standing Committee in the light of comments which might be
. received thereon.
     Comments with respect to the final draft were received from
  a number of individuals and organizations including the Depart­
  ment of Justice and the chairman of the subcommittee on Criminal
  Laws and Procedures of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
  These suggestions were fully oonsidered by both committees and a
  number of changes were made in the draft in response to them.
  The revised definitive draft incorporating these changes was con­
                                 63 

sidered by the Conference and approved for transmittal tD the
Supreme Court with the recommendation that the rules be pro­
mulgated, to be effective October 1, 1972.

  COMMITTEE ON COURT FACILITIES AND DESIGN
   Judge Edward J. Devitt, Chairman, presented the repmt of the
Committee on Court Facilities and Design.
    The Conference was advised that the Committee, which was
created as a result of Conference action at the March 1971 session
(Conf. Rept., p. 3), had visited court facilities in the United States
and abroad and had worked closely with Mr. Robert L. Kunzig,
Administrator of General Services, and his staff.
   The Conference was advised that, after extended discussion at
the first meeting, the Committee arrived at three ba..<;ic conclu­
sions which would govern the deliberations of the Committee. First,
better efficiency must be built intD new facilities embracing the
latest developments in science and technology so as tD· satisfy both
operational and aesthetic needs compatible with the best traditions
of our judicial system. Second, the size of courtrooms should be re­
duced to achieve greater efficiency and curtail the cost of construc­
tion. Thirdly, more attention must be given to the security of court
facilities.
   The GSA presented a series of plans and several models of court­
rooms for the consideration of the Committee. These fell into two
general schemes: a courtroom in the round and a rectangular
courtroom. These were a distillation of all the material in their
hands and their best judgment as to what appeared to embrace the
latest and best thinking on the subject.
   The GSA constructed two full-scale models for the examination
and consideration of the Committee, one in the round and one rec­
tangular, thereby affording a realUfe opportunity to evaluate new
designs and concepts. After careful consideration the Committee
concluded that the rectangular design was preferable to the court­
room in the round.
   The Committee decided that in all new courtroom construction
each court facility shall be equipped with one large (40' x 60')
courtroom and such additional standard (28' x 40') courtrooms
as may be required. Where the need is shown, the Director of the
Administrative Office may authorize additional large (40' by 60')
courtrooms in such number as may be required.
                                  64 

    The CDnference, after visiting a model facility of a standard
courtroom constructed by GSA and CDnferring with Administrator
Kunzig and Chief Architect Walter Meissen, vDted its agreement
with these cDnclusions. The Conference further agreed that each
courtrDom must be available on a case assignment basis to any
judge. No judge of a multiple judge CDurt should have the exclu­
sive use Df any particular courtroom. The availability Df court­
rDoms, when nDt otherwise committeed, shDuld alsO' be Dpen to
other apprDpriate gDvernment usage.
   The CDnference further agreed to' the follOiving conclusiDns pre­
pared by the Committee:
   1. The module Df a standard CDurtrODm should be 28' by 40'.
   2. The module Df a large courtroDm should be 40' by 60'.
   3. The ceiling of the standard courtroom shDuld be approxi­
mately 12' high Dver the activity area with drDpped area approxi­
mately 10' high.
   4. The ceiling of the large CDurtrDom should be apprDximately
16' high.
   5. The principal participants in a trial should be Dn different
floor levels. Court personnel on the lower level; counsel, the wit­
ness, jury and spectators Dn the next level; and the judge shDuld
be Dn a higher level.
    6. MDvability should be built into the fixtures sO' that there
may be maximum fleiXibility in arrangement of the furniture CDn­
sistent with the needs in a particular case. Selected fixed positiDns
to' facilitate use Df electronic recording will be a limiting factor Dn
cDmplete freedDm of movement Df fixtures. By way Df example­
the witness bDX should be mDvable so that it can be easily relDcated
and locked next to the judge Dr opposite the jury as required.
    7. All rails should be movable so as to accommodate varying
requiremen ts.
   8. AttentiDn has been given to cDIDr, light, sound and communi­
cation facilities in the courtrDom SO' that the end result will embrace
the latest in esthetic and technDlogical features.
   9. Access to the courtrO'om ShDUld be prDvided the participants
sO' as to' maintain apprDpriate separation. By way of example-a
separate entrance for the judge, for the jury, for the witness, for
the public, counsel and supporting personnel.
    10. Approval of the Administrative Office and GSA must be
obtained prior to' permitting variatiDns from these basic floor plans
and dimensiDns.
                                        65 

  The Conference was agreed that the ad hoc committee should
continue in existence to work further with GSA on the design of
auxiliary facilities.

                    COMMITTEE ON SALARIES
   Judge William H. Hastie, Chairman, reported to the Conference
for the Committee on Salaries.
   This Committee was established as a result of the action of the
Conference at its March 1971 session (Con£. Rept., p. 3), at which
time it was resolved that there should be created a committee to
study the salary structure of positions in the federal judiciary,
such as referees in bankruptcy, magistrates, clerks of court, pre­
trial examiners, secretaries to judges and ungraded positions.
   After reviewing the recommendations of the committee, the
Conference agreed to the following salary structure for ungraded
officers of the court, subject where necessary to authorization and
the appropriation of funds:
    (1) Circuit Court Executive­
         80 to 85% of a circuit judge's salary (but not to exceed 90% of a
         district judge's salary).
    (2) FUll-time Referee in Bankruptcy'" 

         75 to 800/0 of a district judge's salary. 

    (3) 	 Full-time United States Magistrate· 

         75 to 80% of a district judge's salary. 

    (4) Clerks of Court-
         At least 50 but no more than 75% of a district judge's salary, the salaries
         to be proportioned as follows:
          (a) 	Clerk, Courts of Appeals and Court of Customs and Patent Ap.
              peals-70 to 750/0
         (b) Clerk, Large District and Court of Claims, 70 to 75%
         (c), Clerk, Medium District-65 to 70%
         (d) 	Clerk, Small District, including Territorial Court--5() to 60%
   All salaries, unless otherwise fixed by law, are to be fixed pur­
suant to 28 U.S.C. 604(a) (5) after receiving the individual court's·
recommendation. The report refers to the present salary structure
of the judiciary and the recommendations will be reexamined when
there is again an increase in the salaries of judges.
  The Conference then approved the following as the maximum
salaries that may be paid at this time based on this structure and
  ·Part-time Referees' and Magistrates' salaries would have a maximum of
60% of the fullctime Ilositionsand would be scaled down as at present. The
matter of recommending full-time and part-time salaries within the range would
continue to rest wi th the individual district courts.            .

   The Conference reaflirmed its prior position that the salaries
of full-time magistrates and full-time referees in bankruptcy should
be on a parity.
                            SELEC'r CoMMITTEE

  The Conference agreed with the recommendation of the SaJary
Committee that there should be created a Select Committee, to be
appointed by the Chief Justice, which would recommend to the
Judicial Conference what should be done about top salaries in the
Judicial Branch when the Presidential Commission and the Presi­
dent consider salary inc:reases in 1972 or 1973. Such a committee
would present its recommendations to the Judicial Conference
which, in turn, would take a position and authorizB the committee
to represent the Judicial Branch before the Presidential
Commission.

                           JUDGES' SECRETARIES

   The Conference reaffirmed it support of the Bow bill, R.R. 8726,
92d Congress, which provides for computation of retirement bene­
fits for secretaries on a basis similar to that of Congressional em­
ployees. The Conference also agreed that legislative authorization
should be sought for accelerated step-increases for secretaries. The
Conference agreed that as long as the appropriations committee
imposes a limitation of JSP 10 on judicial secretarial salaries, it is
without authocization to exceed this limitation.

               FuRTHER ACTIVITY OF THE CoMMITTEE

  The Committee had recommended to the Conference that it be
discharged. The Conference was of the view, however, that there
were graded positions which also needed consideration and, accord­
ingly, on recommendation of the Chairman of the Committee it was
agreed that for the purposes of this further study the Oommittee
                                         67 

 would meet jointly with the Subcommittee on Supporting Person­
 nel and present a joint report on this subject matter.

                         REVIEW COMMITTEE
  Judge Edward A. Tamm, Chairman, presented the report 'of the
Review Oommittee.
  At the March 1971 session of the Oonference (Conf. Rept., p. 24)
the Conference adopted tJie following resolution relative to the
review of reports of extrajudicial income filed semi-annually by
federal judges pursuant to Conference resolution (Conf. Rept.,
Oct. 1969 session, p. 50) :
     (a) 	The Review Committee shall notify such judge, and the chief judge
           of the circuit or the chief judge of other courts who are members of the
          Conference of such fact who shall then request such judge to advise
          within 30 days that he is in compliance;
     (b) 	In the event such judge fails or refuses to advilSe that he has complied
          as in paragraph (a), the chief judge shall inform such judge that unless
          the judge advises within 60 days that he is in compliance, this fact
          will be published in the next report of the Judicial Conference;
     (c) 	If at the expiration of the OO-day period, the judge fails or declines to
          file the semi-annual report, the chief judge shall also request the judge
          to state whether he is or is not in compliance with the 1963 resolution;
          a failure or refusal so to state willUkewise be published;
     (d) 	In the event the judge declines to make a report on grounds of con­
          Science, he shall be advised that if desired such fact will be noted in the
          published report.
   Pursuant to this resolution, Judge Tamm reported that 14 judges,
not including eight judges of the United States Customs Court,
have not filed reports for the period January 1-June 30, 1971, as
follows:

Tenth Oircuit:

   Judge Tamm then made the following recommendations, all of
which were agreed to by the Conference:
   1. The number of positions held by federal judges as officers or
directors of educational, religious, civic and charitable organiza­
tions should not be so great in number as to jeopardize the particular
performance of judicial duties. Judges' participation as officers in
such groups and organizations should not numerically exceed a
quantity which would necessitate undue absence from the perform­
ance of judicial duties and responsibilities.
   2. Federal judges should not serve as officers or directors of orga­
nizations, national, regional or local, which are present or potential
litigants in the federal courts or are the promoters, sponsors or
financiers of organizations sponsoring litigation in the federal courts.
   3. In all cases involving actual, potential, probable or possible
conflicts of interest, a federal judge should reach his own determina­
tion as to whether he should recuse himself from a particular case,
without calling upon counsel to express their views as to the desira­
bility of his remaining in the case. The too-frequent practice of ad­
vising counsel of a possible conflict and asking counsel to indicate
their approval of a judge's remaining in a partiCUlar case is fraught
with potential coercive elements which make this practice undesir­
  *Judges heretofore declining to file "as a matter of principle".

able. The Committee approves the procedure suggested by the In­
terim Advisory Committee in its Opinion No. 20.
   4. Upon the ultimate adoption by the American Bar Associa­
tion of a new set of Canons of Judicial Ethics, the Judicial Confer­
ence of the United States should establish some guiding criteria as
to the propriety, in nature and amount, of honoraria accepted by
federal judges for commencement addresses, lectures, speeches, etc.
Your Committee suggests that the amount accepted by federal
judges, if honoraria per se are approved, should never exceed the
amount which would be paid to a non-judge for the same or similar
services.
   5. The chief circuit judge of each circuit should exercise close
supervision over the extra-judicial teaching and lecturing commit­
ments of the judges within his circuit to such an extent that these
and other extra-judicial activities will be held to such a minimum
as to insure that those activities are not being carried on to the
detriment of the performance of official judicial duties. Each chief
circuit judge should be especially alert to carefully check all extra­
judicial activities in those districts where the judicial work is not
current.
    INTERIM ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL 

                  ACTIVITIES 

   Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman, presented the report of the
Interim Advisory Committee on Judicial Activities.
   The Conference noted that since the last session of the Confer­
ence two additional formal opinions have been published, namely,
Opinions Nos. 22 and 23. Copies of the formal opinions are cir­
culated to all federal judges as soon as they are published. In addi­
tion, the Committee has responded by letter to several inquiries
of judges where the Committee considered that either the judicial
canons of the American Bar Association or the canons as previously
interpreted by the Committee had given clear guidance as to the
proper answer to be made.
   The Conference also noted the following statement submitted
by the Committee:
  From information coming direct to the Committee, and by way of inquiry
from the Review Committee chaired by Judge Tamm, it became apparent that
there is a substantial number of judges who have continued, since their appoint­
ment, to serve for compensation in fiduciary capacities, either as sole or joint
                                        70 

executor, administrator or conservator of an estate or as sole or joint trustee
for an inter vivos or testamentary trust. Several judges serve in several different
fiduciary capacities. The Oommittee received no information indicating that
any compensation paid for such services exceeded that which would ordinarily
attach to the office.
  The latest tentative draft of the ABA. Committee report, dated May 1971,
prohibits the performance of such fiduciary duties for compensation for non­
family estates or trusts. However, it contains a "grandfather clause" that makes
the prohibition effective only after the date on which the new rules become
effective.
  The Committee has hesitated to reply by published opinion to the inqUiries
of this nature, because the Committee perceives a substantial distinction between
the strict immedIate prohibition against perfoI'lIling services as officer, director
or employee ofa corporation (even a family corporation) enacted by the Judicial
Conference in 1963 and the present and proposed future canon of the American
Bar Association relating to the "business-like" performance of a fiduciary for a
non-family trust or estate.
  The Committee considered that the proper way to handle this matter was for
this statement to be embodied in the report of the Committee to the Judicial
Conference.

        COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The report of the Commitwe on Court Administration was pre­
sented by its Chairman, Judge Robert A. Ainsworth.•Jr.

                PROMPT DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN CASES

    The Conference was advised that the records of the Administra­
 tive Office of the United States Courts show that 57% of the
 criminal cases filed in the Federal District Courts are disposed of
 in the median time of three months and 98 % of the criminal cases
filed in the Federal System are disposed of in the median time of
six months. The remaining two percent of the cases are of types
which deserve and require as nearly as possible a comparable chron­
ological time table despite the fact that they may present difficult
and time-consuming problems both of fact and law. The Confer­
ence recognized that some civil cases also present similar complexi­
ties and many districts have by rule or established practice taken
steps to avoid delays in what are designated "protracted" cases.
   Independent of statutory and constitutional provisions designed
to guarantee speedy disposition of cases, the Conference agreed that
considerations of sound judicial administration dictate first that
rules, procedure or administrative practices be developed forthwith
to identify at the earliest possible stage those C3SeS which appear
likely to be subject to delays and second to assure that no avoidable
delays are tolerated.
                                  71 


PROGRAM FOR PROMPT DISPOSITION OF PROTRACTED, DIFFICULT, OR
                     WIDELY PUBLICIZED CASES

  The following proposals were submitted to the Conference by the
Committee on Court Administration and were adopted by the Con­
ference for the purpose of assuring that cases likely to be protracted,
difficult, or un usual are not allowed to pend for periods more lengthy
than that required for so-called routine cases. Without amending
existing programs for the assignment and calendaring of cases in
individual circuits or districts this program requires the screening
promptly upon the return of the indictment or filing of the com­
plaint and before assignment to individual judges of such cases, and
the assignment of such cases to judges most available to assure
orderly and prompt disposition under existing statutes and rules
of procedure. These proposals, while basically addresesd to multi­
judge district courts should, nevertheless, be followed wherever
practicable, feasible and applicable by all district courts. Similarly,
circuit courts of appeals should utilize these requirements to assure
prompt disposition of the appeals in these types of cases. While
statutory precedence must be given to criminal cases the procedures
outlined hereafter are recommended for the handling of civil
cases within the categories enumerated above, especially those
cases presenting extraordinary potential for complication or delay.

                                  I
   There shall be established within each multi-judge court a screen­
ing system whereby all cases potentially presenting unusually dif­
ficult questions of law or procedure and which may require longer
periods of time for disposition than so-called routine cases, or which
by their inherent nature will require exceptional supervision, will
be identified and assigned in accordance with the procedures herein
set forth. The ultimate responsibility for proper assignment of
these cases remains with the chief judge of each district court, but
in multi-judge courts some courts have utilized an executive or
assignment committee, not to exceed three judges, to advise and
consult with him in determining the judge or judges best available
to promptly and properly dispose of each case within the categories
enumerated herein. To insure efficient screening it is recommended
that the chief judge, or the committee, where practical, hold a daily
conference with the clerk of court to review the cases filed in the
prior day's business. If such a conference is impractical, the chief
                                 72 


judge shall perfect such other arrangements as are required to bring
these cases immediately to his attention. Judges presiding at the
reporting of indictments by grand juries should be alert to identify
cases within the categories enumerated, including but not limited
to defendants unable to post bond, aggravated criminal offenses
and defendants with extensive criminal records who are released on
bail.
                                 II
   When the screening process identifies cases within the categories
enumerated they shall be assigned by the chief judge or the assign­
ment committee to the judge best available to assure their continu­
ous and close supervision and prompt disposition. In making this
assignment the chief judge shall consult with and seek the advice
of any executive or assignment committee which he has established
for the screening process. An appropriate alternative would be for
the chief judge to draw at random a judge from among those desig­
nated as most available. The assignment of the district judge to
handle the cases identified through the screening process will be
made promptly after the identification of the case.

                                III
  Immediately upon notification of the assignment to try a case
the district judge shall take all proper and required steps to assure
the prompt disposition of the case. Pre-trial conferences should be
scheduled with trial counsel, stated periods established for filing
and disposition of motions, discovery procedures scheduled, and
early trial date fixed and maintained. The district court shall main"
tain constant supervision over all phases of the case, by frequent
record conferences with counsel. After a verdict and judgment, if
an appeal is noted, the trial judge shall issue such orders as are
necessary to assure immediate filing of such parts of the transcript
as may be needed.
                                   IV
  The chief judge on his own motion, or on the request of a
specially assigned judge, should have power to relieve the trial
judge of so much of his regular case assignment as may be necessary
to insure prompt disposition of any specially assigned case or cases.
In providing for such relief the chief judge may, of course, use the
services of other judges of his own court or may, if necessary, re- /'
quest the circuit chief judge to seek the temporary assignment of l"
                                       73

    o.utside judges under the pro.visio.ns o.f the intercircuit assignment
    statutes and procedures.
                                        v
       In district co.urts having o.ne, two. o.r three judges the chief judge
    thereof sho.uld o.bserve the underlying principles set fo.rth herein
    to. identify cases requiring and justifying immediate assignment
    and clo.se supervisio.n. In the event the chief judge o.f a district be­
    lieves a case requires prio.rity assignment and his co.mmitments
    and that o.f his asso.ciates o.n that co.urt are such as to. make impo.s­
    sible such assignment, he shall pro.mptly, after the identificatio.n
    o.f such a case, co.nsult the chief circuit judge o.f his circuit and re­
    quest the immediate assignment o.f a judge fro.m within o.r witho.ut
    the circuit to handle the identified case. Upo.n receipt o.f such re­
    quest the chief circuit judge shall fo.rthwith designate a judge to
    hear the case. If a judge is not available within the circuit fo.r such
    assignment he will under existing procedures effect the assignment
    to the case of the most available judge on an inter-circuit basis. In
    designating a judge for assignment a chief circuit judge will give
    appropriate consideration to matters of geographical convenience to
    co.urt and supPo.rting personnel, counsel, litigants, witnesses, as
    well as physical court facilities.

                                       VI
       After disposition in the district court of a case specially assigned
    under this resolution and its appeal to the circuit co.urt, the appro­
    priate court of appeals shall take all necessary and proper steps to.
    avo.id any delay in its dispositio.n of the case. It shall be the re­
    sponsibility of the trial judge to file with the clerk of the court
    o.f appeals a notice that the case was handled and disposed of on
    a prio.rity basis. Upon receipt of such certificatio.n the clerk o.f
    the circuit court will immediately no.tify the chief judge of the cir­
    cuit of such filing, and that chief judge will arrange, after consulta­
    tio.n with co.unsel, an expedited briefing schedule, and an argument
    date at the earliest possible time after closing of the briefing sched­
    ule. Necessary o.rders fo.r the expedited filing o.f trial and other
    transcripts sho.uld be iSl;3ued and enfo.rced. If necessary the chief
    circuit judge shall arrange fo.r the trial court repo.rter to give prio.r­
    ity to preparatio.n of such portions o.f the transcript as may be re­
    quired. If practicable and agreeable to co.unsel, the co.urt o.f appeals
(   may waive written briefs, permit submission witho.ut argument,
                                  74 

permit appeal on typed briefs, or take such other procedural steps
as are practical and legal to expedite hearing and disposition. The
court of appeals may, after hearing, announce its ruling orally from
the bench, with or without opinion to follow such orders.

                                 VII
  The following definitions are applicable to the Resolution:
  "Best Available Judge" means that judge whose current commit­
ments, health, judicial experience, experience in the fields of legal
activity and facts involved in the particular case, qualify him as
being one of those suited to handle the category of case under
consideration.
  "Prompt Disposition" means ordinarily not more than sixty days
total elapsed time from date of filing to date of trial, oral argument
or appeal.
                               VIII
  The Handbook for the handling of protracted cases is recom­
mended as a source of data designed to expedite the disposition of
cases embraced within this resolution.
                                 IX
  Adopted by the Judicial Conference of the United States this
29th day of October 1971.
MATTERS RELATING TO DIVISIONS AND PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

   The Conference next considered a series of proposed bills on
which the views of the OonfeTence had been sought by the appro­
priate committees of the Congress.
   The Conference approved H.R. 6745, a bill which would remove
Gregory County from the Southern Division and would remove
Mellett, Todd and Tripp Counties from the Western Division of
South Dakota and place these counties in the Central Division of
that court. This proposal has been approved by the judges of the
District Court and the Judicial Council of the Eighth Circuit.
   The Conference voted its disapproval of the following bills:
   1. S. 1137 and H.R. 4563 which would transfer Obion and Lake
Counties from the Eastern to the Western Division of the Dis­
trict Court for Western Tennessee;
                                      75
      2. S. 230 providing for the holding of court at Morgantown,
    West Virginia;
      3. H.R. 4775 providing for the holding of court at Santa Ana in
    the Central District of California;
      4. S. 1296 and S. 1668, creating the Lufkin Division for the East­
    ern District of Texas.
      All of these bills, disapproved by the Conference, were disap­
    proved by the Judicial Councils of the respective circuits.

                          FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

        The Conference next considered a series of bills relating to the
     subject of financial disclosure or reporting by federal judges and
     Justices, as follows:
        1. S. 1885, known as the omnibus disclosure act, applying to
     reporting of income by all federal employees whose salaries exceed
     $18,000 per year;
        2. n.R. 7830, known as the Federal financial disclosure act, and
     calling for the reporting of gross income of federal employees,
     spouses and dependent children;
        3. n.R. 588 and n.R. 1347, prohibiting compensation to any
     judge or Justice for any service other than salary, except where
     approved by the Judicial Council. These bills also require annual
     reports of investmen ta, assets and income;
       4. n.R. 6182 prohibits a judge or Justice from accepting com­
     pensation for services performed without prior approval of his
     circuit council or his Court and provides that such compensation,
     when permitted, shall be made a matter of public record;
       5. n.R. 372 and n.R. 1319 applies to Justices and judges and
     provides for annual filing of a sealed report of financial interests,
     assets and liabilities.
       The Conference noted each of these bills and agreed that Con­
    .gressional committees should be advised that the Conference would
     recommend that action on each of these bills be withheld pending
     consideration by the American Bar Association and by the Judicial
     Conference of the proposed Code of Judicial Ethics prepared by
     the Traynor Committee and now awaiting action by the American
     Bar Association.
       The Conference pointed out, further, that at the present tims
     each federal judge makes a semi-annual report of extrajudicial in­
(
                                76 


come which discloses not only any income for extrajudicial services
but as well any gifts received by him or his immediate family, as
well as knowing participation by the judge in cases in which he or a
member of his immediate family might have had any financial
interest.
  Insofar as any of these bills applies outside the judicial branch,
the Conference made no recommendation.

            ESTABLISHMENT OF A COURT OF ETHICS

  H.J. Res. 32 would create a three-judge bipartisan court of
ethics to hear complaints of unethical conduct by federal officers
and employees. Insofar as this bill would apply to the judiciary,
the Conference expressed its disapproval as unnecessary and
undesirable.

            DISQUALIFICATION OF JUSTICES AND JUDGES

  The Conference voted its disapproval of S. 1553, a bill which
would completely revise the present section 455 of title 28, United
States Code. The Conference expressed the view that the present
section 455 has served its purpose exceptionally well and that no
instances have been called to its attention of the inadequacy or
abuse of the present statute.
  The Conference also voted to disapprove S. 1886, entitled the
Judicial Disqualification Act of 1971, which would drastically
amend both Section 455 and Section 144 of Title 28, United States
Code. The Conference expressed the view that the proposed amend­
ment to Section 455 dealt largely with matters covered in the pro­
posed new Code of Judicial Ethics of the American Bar Association
and the Conference believes that any action regarding Section 455
should await final action by the American Bar Association as well
as by the Judicial Conference relating to the new Code of Judicial
Ethics.
  As to the amendment of Section 144, the Conference agreed with
the views of its Committee on Court Administration that in large
measure that statute has been utiliged to disqualify a judge not
because of actual bias or prejudice against one party or in favor of
the other but because the moving party believes the presiding
judge may not look with favor upon his position. The Conference
believes it is unwise to remove the safeguards written into the
present statute.
                                      77 

      The Conference also considered an amendment to Section 144
    proposed by Senator Bennett which would permit the filing of an
    affidavit of bias or prejudice against counsel in the case as well.
    The Conference voted to disapprove this suggestion.
                   MANDATORY RETIREMENT OF JUDGES

       The Conference next considered and voted to disapprove S.J.
    Res. 57 relating to the mandatory retirement of Justices and judges
    upon reaching the age of seventy and S.J. Res. 113 proposing a
    Constitutional amendment for mandatory retirement at the age
    of 72. In taking this action the Conference agreed to adhere to the
    position taken at its October 1970 session (Conf. Rept., p. 76)
    favoring mandatory retirement of Justices and judges at age
    seventy, with a proviso that those not eligible to retire on attaining
    age seventy shall continue in office until becoming eligible. The
    Conference did not then and does not now propose that a Consti­
    tutional amendment is necessary to accomplish these objectives.
       The Conference further reiterated the position taken at its Octo­
    ber 1970 session (Conf. Rept., p. 77) which would endorse legisla­
    tion then pending in the 91st Congress providing that a judge who
    has reached the age of 70 may retire after 10 years of service, at
    the age of 69 after 11 years of service, at the age of 68 after 12
    years of service, at the age of 67 after 13 years of service, at the
    age of 66 after 14 years of service and at the age of 65 after 15
    years of service.
       The Conference noted that Section 3 of Public Law 85--593 pro­
    vided in part that the amendment of Section 136, Title 28, United
    States Code, relating to the office of chief judge of the district would
    not be effective with respect to any district having two judges in
    regular active service so long as the district judge holding the office
    of chief judge of any such district on August 6, 1958 continued to
    hold such a position. The Conference agreed that this legislative
    proviso had outlived its usefulness and agreed to recommend to
    the Congress a draft bill to carry out the views of the Conference.
                           RETIREMENT BENEFITS

       The Conference had for consideration two bills affecting annui­
    ties to widows of Justices and judges, namely, S. 1479 and S. 1480.
    The Conference was in agreement in approving S. 1479 which would
(
    increase the annuity of present widows of Supreme Court Justices
                                     78 

from $5,000 to $10,000 per year. In lieu of S. 1480 which would
permit Justices of the Supreme Court to come within the terms of
the Judicial Survivors' Annuity Act, the Conference approved a
complete revision of the Judicial Survivors' Annuity Act not only
to permit Justices to come within the benefits of that legislation
but also would include the Judicial Survivors' Annuity Fund in the
Civil Service Retirement Fund, thus avoiding the anticipated early
exhaustion of the existing Judicial Survivors' Annuity Fund. The
Conference authorized the transmission to the Congress of the
proposed revision of the Judicial Survivors' Annuity Act.
   The Conference next considered a proposal by Congressman
Udall to amend 28 U.S.C. 371 to provide for the reduction in the
salary paid to a Justice or judge who does not resign or retire upon
reaching the age of seventy. The Conference was in agreement
that this proposal presented serious Constitutional problems and
should be disapproved.
   The Conference voted to disapprove S. 1976 which would provide
that a retired Justice or judge shall not perform judicial duties at
any time after he has been retired from regular active service for
more than five years.
   The Conference voted to disapprove S.J. Res. 106 limiting by
Constitutional amendment the terms of judges to eight years.
   The Conference voted to disapprove S. 1967 which would provide
 that Justices and judges not reaffirmed after an eight-year term,
 as provided in S.J. Res. 106, would continue to receive the salary
of their office for the remainder of their lifetime.
                  FEES IN THE CoURTS OF ApPEALS

   The Conference approved a resolution recommended by the
Ninth Circuit Judicial Council, with the proviso that its applica­
tion to any court of appeals should be at the election- of each such
court. The resolution reads:
  For sometime it has been the practice in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
to dispense with an appendix in an appellate record and to hear the appeal on
the original record, with a number of copies thereof being suppUed (Rule SOf,
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure). It has been the practice of the Court
to tax a fee of $5 in smaU records and $10 in large records for the time of the
clerk involved in preparing such appeals and by way of reim:bursement for
postage expense. Judicial Conference approval heretofore has not been secured
and the Judicial CouncU of the Ninth 'Circuit now seeks to fix a fiat fee of $15
to 'be charged as fees for costs to be charged by a~ court of appeals "in any
appeal in which the requirement of an appendix is dispensed with pursuant to
Rule SOl, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure."
                                            79 

                     CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION

       The Conference considered several legislative proposals which
    had been referred to it dealing with various aspects of consumer pro­
    tection and consumer remedies. As to each of these bills the Con­
    ference took the position that they- involve basically a matter of
    legislative policy on which the Conference should not express an
    opinion. The bills involved are:
        1. 	 B.R. 260 to protect consumers against unreasonable risk of injury from
             hazardous products ;
        2. 	 B.R. 261 to authorize the Federal Trade Commission to set standards to
             guarantee comprehensive warranty protection to purchasers of merchan­
             dise shipped in interstate commerce;
        3. 	 B.R. 262 to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to extend protection
             against fraudulent or deceptive practices condemned by that Act to con­
             sumers through civil actions, and to provide for class actions by defrauded
             consumers;
        4. 	 A draft bill to provide for testing of consumer products and penalties for
             misrepresentation of the results of such testing;
        5. 	 A draft bill to create the National Institute for Consumer Justice;
        6. 	 A draft bill to provide increased protection for consumers and for other
             purposes;
        7. 	A draft bill to provide warranty protection for consumers and for other
             purposes;
        8. 	 B.R. 667 to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act by providing for
             temporary injunctions or restraining orders for certain violations of
             that Act;
        9. 	 H.R. 5630 to provide implementation of the Federal Trade Commission
             Act to give increased protection to consumers, and for other purposes;
       10. 	A draft 'bill to provide for the development, adoption and promulgation
             of product safety standards.

    DIVISION OF JURISDICTION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL CoURTS

       The Senate Judiciary Committee had referred to the Conference
    for comment S. 1876, a bill to provide for the division of jurisdic­
    tion between state and federal courts in implementation of the rec­
    ommendations of the American Law Institute. The Conference took
    the position that the proposals contained in S. 1876 are well con­
    ceived, workable and based upon acceptable compromise of variant
    views of the bench and bar. The Conference reiterated, however,
    its preference for the bills approved by the October 1970 session
    of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 78) designed to eliminate the
    requirement of a three-judge district court in cases seeking to
    restrain the enforcement of state or federal statutes for repugnance'
    to the Constitution and to provide for direct appeal to the Supreme
(   Court in certain cases.
                                        80

                            OTHER LEGISLATION

   The Conference considered a draft bill to amend the Trade Mark
Act to extend the time for filing oppositions, to eliminate the
requirement of filing reasons for appeal in the Patent Office and to
provide for awarding of attorneys' fees. The Conference noted that
this proposed legislation refers only to the Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals. In lieu of commenting on the legislation as such,
therefore, the Conference decided to send to the Office of Manage­
ment and Budget a copy of a letter which the Subcommittee on
Federal Jurisdiction which originally considered the draft bill had
received from Chief Judge Worley of the Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals on this subject.
   The Conference next considered a series of bills, each of which
it was decided involved a matter of legislative policy and on which
the Conference should take no position, as follows:
   1. A draft bill to expand the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission
        by substituting the words "affecting commerce" for the words "in com­
        merce," in section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act;
   2. 	A draft bill to amend the Federal Aviation Act to provide for representa­
        tion of the Civil Aeronautics Board in court proceedings through its own
        counsel and to provide for all review of Board actions in the courts of
        appeals;
   8. A Department of Justice draft bill to amend Title 28, United States Code,
        by adding a section providing exclusive original jurisdiction in the district
        courts of civil actions under Section 2409a ;
   4. A draft bill to extend the life of the Indian Claims Commission;
   5. 	 S. 1489 to establish a Judicial Assistance Administration within the De­
       partment of Justice.
   The Conference also expressed disapproval of two bills, the sub­
ject matter of which has been before previous sessions of the Con­
ference at which the Conference took the same action:
   1. 	H.R. 4856 and H.B. 9428 for enforcement of family support orders in cer­
        tain state and federal courts and making it a crime to move in interstate
        commerce -to avoid compliance with such orders;
   2. 	 H.B. 2878 to provide for the estabUshment of a United States Court of
        Labor Management Relations.

  REPRESENTATION OF INDIGENTS BY CERTAIN LAW STUDENTS

   The Conference was advised that many state courts have through
rule-making or otherwise provided clinical experience for law stu­
dents through permitting such students who qualify to represent
indigents in civil and criminal proceedings under the supervision
of a lawyer admitted to the bar. Most of these states have used the "
American Bar Association model rule as a guide in determining the
                                           81 

    conditions under which law students may practice in their court.
    The Conference agreed to recommend that all federal courts con­
    sider the advisability of adopting a local rule similar to the Amer­
    ican Bar Association model rule but tailored to the needs of the
    particular district or circuit. The Conference was in agreement that
    the participation of qualified law stu den ts in this clinical experimen t
    not only would redound to their benefit as lawyers but would pro­
    vide much needed legal assistance under appropriate supervision
    for indigent parties who might otherwise be to,tally unrepresented.
      The Omference further approved H.R. 8084, a bill to provide that
    the federal government shall assume the risks of its fidelity losses.

                        ADDITIONAL CIRCUIT JUDGESHIPS

      After consideration of the recommendations of the Committee
    on Court Administration based on the quadrennial survey of the
    needs of the court.s of appeals conducted by the Subcommittee on
    Judicial Statistics, the Conference agreed to recommend to the Con­
    gress the establishment of ten additional circuit judgeships, as
    follows:
    Circuit:                                                              Number
        First____________________________________________________________      1
        Second __________________________________________________________     *2
        ~ird    ___________________________________________________________    1
        Fourth __________________________________________________________      2
        Fifth ___________________________________________________________      0
        Sixth ___________________________________________________________      0
        Seventh _________________________________________________________     1
        Eighth __________________________________________________________     0
        Ninth ___________________________________________________________     2
        Tenth ___________________________________________________________     1
        Dist. of CoL_____________________________________________________     0
          Total _________________________________________________________    10

      • Conditional upon certification of need by the JUdicial Conference
       In 'making this recommendation the Conference noted that based
    on statistics alone seven additional judgeships would be warranted
    in the Fifth Circuit over and above the 15 now authorized and five
    additional judgeships would be warranted in the Ninth Circuit
    rather than the two recommended. The Conference agreed further
    with its Committee on Court Administration that to increase the
    number of judges in ,a circuit beyond 15 would create an unworkable
    situation. In this connection the Conference noted a resolution
(   unanimously adopted by the judges of the Fifth Circuit in October
                                   82 

1971 in which the judges state that the Judicial Council "holds
strongly to its prior formal determination that to increase the num­
ber of judges beyond 15 would diminish the quality of justice in
this circuit and the effectiveness of this court to function as an insti­
tutionalized federal appellate court." The Judicial Council of the
Fifth Circuit went on to endorse H.R. 7378, a bill to establish a
Commission on the Revision of the Judicial Circuits as previously
proposed by the Judicial Conference "as an indispensable first step
toward improvement in the federal circuit court system."

                    DISTRICT CoURT JUDGESHIPS

   The Conference noted that bills had been referred for considera­
tion to provide for additional district judgeships in the Districts of
Kansas, Massachusetts and Oregon. The Conference was in agree­
ment, however, that inasmuch as the quadrennial survey of district
court needs will be undertaken early in 1972, the Conference would
not, absent a showing of emergency, recommend any additional
district judgeships at this time.
SALARY FIXING AND ApPOINTING AUTHORITY IN THE SPECIAL
                                CoURTS

   The Conference next considered and approved for transmittal to
the Congress two bills treating with the salary fixing authority and
appointing authority for employees of the Court of Claims, the
Customs Court and the Court of CustolIl8 and Patent Appeals. The
Conference noted the recommendation of the Subcommittee on
Supporting Personnel that such legishttion was important to
achieve desirable uniformity among the federal courts and to lay at
rest any questions of interpretation and unnecessary controversy.
In approving the recommendation for the uniform treatment of
salary fixing and appointing authority in the special courts the
Conference noted that there was no intention to affect the grades
and special qualifications now existing for the legal assistants of the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Customs Court.
                 FEDERALIZATION OF TRANSCRIBERS

  The Conference approved and directed the transmission to the
Congress of a proposed bill whereby transcribers employed by offi­
cial court reporters would be appointed as regular federal court
employees and paid from appropriated funds on a standard per an-:
num basis with the appropriation being largely reimbursed for th~
                                        83 

costs of the salaries by the official court reporters returning to the
United States Treasury a fixed percentage of their transcript in­
come. The legislation is permissive for any court and the Confer­
ence noted that the Administrative Office had prepared a set of
tentative qualification standards for court transcribers should the
legislation be enacted.
                   PROJECTION OF PERSONNEL NEEDS

   Based on the responses of the individual courts to the Director
of the Administrative Office the Subcommittee on Supporting Per­
sonnel made a careful review of the personnel needs of the courts.
Based on the result of this study the Conference has approved, sub­
ject to the availability of funds and, if necessary in any individual
case, subject to the passage of substantive legislation needed to
achieve the requests, the following recommendations:
      In the Courts of Appeals Clerks' Offices, 24 additional deputy clerks. 

      In the District Court Clerks' Offices, 210 additional deputy clerks. 

      In the Referees' Offices, 119 positions. 

      In the Probation Offices, 320 probation officers, 30 full·time probation offi­

    cer assistants, 177 clerks.
  The Conference also ap.Rroved that any requested positions
which were not granted for fiscal year 1972 be added to the above
totals.
  The Conference approved the request of Chief Judge Brown of
the Fifth Circuit, subject to the availability of funds and the draft­
ing of substantive legislation if deemed needed by the Budget Com­
mittee, as follows:
  (a) Judges Staff:

                  COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
  The Budget Committee report was presented by its Chairman,
Judge Carl A. Weinman. Because of the necessity of submitting the
budget to the Office of Management and Budget prior to Oc­
                                  84 

tober 15, the report had been previously circulated to the members
of the Conference and approved by mail vote.
   The appropriation bill, signed into law August 10, 1971, carried
out the recommendations of the House Committee, allowing
$164,804,000 for the Judiciary, exclusive of the Supreme Court.
This included approval of 172 additional positions: 22 deputy
clerks for the courts of appeals, 16 law clerks for senior circuit
judges, 11 circuit court executives and a clerical assistant for each,
67 deputy clerb for the district courts, 28 probation officers and 18
clerical assistants, a librarian and two interpreters. There were also
included funds for salary increases for court reporters. Requests by
the Director to the Senate Appropriation Committee for restora­
tion of funds for other personnel were unavailing, however, except
as to secretaries for circuit judges; this sum was subsequently
deleted in Senate-House Conference Committee. The Conference
authorized the Director to submit to the Congress requests for sup­
plemental appropriations for fiscal year 1972 as may be necessary.

                        ESTIMATES FOR     1973
   The estimates approved for fiscal year 1973 for the judiciary,
exclusive of the Supreme Court, the CU'Stoms Court and the Federal
Judicial Center, aggregate $180,428,000, an increase of $19,234,000
over the amounts appropriated for 1972. The increase includes all
funds requested for personnel approved by the Conference (see
Report of Committee on Court Administration) but does not
include the Fifth Circuit request for $208,000 to establish a staff law
office, for which the Budget Committee believed substantive legis­
lation would be required.

                         PROPOSED CHANGES

   The Conference approved proposed changes in limitation on the
aggregate salaries of secretaries and law clerks to circuit and district
judges, so as to provide the aggregate salaries paid to secretaries
by each of the circuit and district judges shall not exceed $62,257
and $39,172, respectively, and for chief judges of circuits and dis­
tricts not to exceed $84,244 and $42,754 per annum, respectively.
   The Conference approved also changes in text of the appropria­
tion for Salaries of Referees and Expenses of Referees to provide for
payments from monies in the Treasury of any deficiencies in the
Referees' Salary and Expense Fund.
                                     85
                       FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS

       The Conference approved the budget estimates submitted by
    Federal Public Defenders for fiscal years 1972 and 1973 but with the
    understanding that any requests for additional full-time attorneys
    shall be subject to the approval of the respective judicial councils
    of the circuits and any requests for other personnel shall be subject
    to the approval of the Director of the Administrative Office.

                          LAND COMMISSWNERS

       The Conference, at the March 1971 session (Conf. Rept., p. 26),
    deferred at the request of the Chairman of the Budget Committee
    consideration of the report relating to responsibility for obtaining
    funds for compensation and expenses of commissioners appointed
     under Rule 71 (A)(H) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. At
    the request of the Department of Justice special studies of this
    subject have been made in 1961 and again in 1970 and each time it
    was concluded by the ad hoc committees created for this purpose
    that the responsibility of obtaining these funds should be trans­
    ferred to the Administrative Office provided the Department of
    Justice seeks and obtains approval thereof from the appropriating
    authorities. Should such a transfer take place, the committees were
    agreed that a study should be made of appropriate guidelines for and
    possible supervision of the use of the fund by the judges who make
    such commissioner appointments. The 1961 recommendations were
    not adopted at the request of the then Chairman of the Budget
    Committee. The present Budget Committee, after a review of the
    1970 recommendations of the ad hoc committee as reported to the
    March 1971 session of the Conference, again recommended that the
    request of the Department of Justice be denied. The Conference
    agreed.
         PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS
                      OF APPEALS
       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, the Conference approved the pre­
    termission of terms of courts of appeals for those sessions of the
    Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to be held at Asheville,
    North Carolina, and those terms of the Court of Appeals for the
    Eighth Circuit which might be held in places other than St. Louis
    prior to the next session of the Conference.
