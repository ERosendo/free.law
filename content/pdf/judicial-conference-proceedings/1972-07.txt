and District Judges Milton Pollack, Edward Weinfeld and Alfonso
J. Zirpoli attended all or some of the sessions of the Conference.
   The Honorable Richard G. Kleindienst, Acting Attorney Gen­
eral, addressed the Conference at the opening of the first· session
on matters of concern to the Department of Justice and the
judiciary.
   The Honorable Alfred P. Murrah, Director of the Federal Judi­

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   The Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Kirks, addressed
the Conference on the trends which occurred in case filings during
the first half of fiscal year 1972.
   As to civil filings, Mr. Kirks said that the trend was still upward,
but at a sharply reduced rate. There were 46,888 civil filings for
the first half of this fiscal year. This is only one-half of one percent
greater than total civil filings during the comparable period last
year. Civil terminations were up 12 percent over the first half of
last fiscal year. There were 44,407 cases closed compared to 39,771
a year ago.
   He observed that in the first half of this fiscal year there was a
sharp decline in local jurisdiction cases, largely caused by court
reorganization in the District of Columbia which transferred a
large number of this type case to the new Superior Court. Motor
  ·Judge Giles S. Rich attended the second day of the Conference in place of
Chief Judge Worley, as designated by the Chief Justice.
                                 3

vehicle cases nationally dropped to 3,937 as compared with 4,591
in the same period of fiscal 1971. This represents a 15 percent
decrease. Prisoner petitions dropped by two percent in the same
period.
   Mr. Kirks reported that the story on criminal filings was vastly
different. Criminal filings increased more than 18 percent over the
first six months of 1971. By December 31, 1971, 22,211 criminal
actions had been docketed as compared with 18,824 filings for
the comparable period last year.
   There is an alarming and continuing increase in the number of
very old civil cases on the dockets of district courts, Mr. Kirks
said; these were up to 9,022 on June 30,1971, from 8,004 the previ­
ous year. As of December 1971, this inventory had climbed again
to 9,902-a 10 percent increase in six months.
                FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER
  The Director of the Center, Judge Alfred P. Murrah, presented
three recommendations on behalf of the Board of the Center. Two
of these related to oourt reporters and the third to publication of
opinions of the Courts of Appeals. The Conference refeITed the
three recommendations to the Committee on Court Administration
for study and report. In so doing, the Conference agreed that as a
matter of policy in the future, recommendations emanating from
the Center should be referred to and staffed through the appropriate
committees of he Conference before presentation to the
Conference.
  The Conference elected Judge Walter E. Hoffman of the Eastern
District of Virginia to a full four-year term as a member of the
Board of the Center, vice Judge Harold Tyler, and elected Judge
Marvin Frankel of the Southern District of New York to serve the
remaining two years of the term of Judge Gerhard Gesell.
   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                       CRIMINAL LAW
  Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli, Chairman, presented the Committee's
report to the Conference.
         LAPSE OF PRoSECUTION OF CERTAIN OFFENSES

  The Department of Justice had directed the attention of the
Committee to the foot that there is a 8ubstantiallapse in law en­
forcement of certain offenses, such as the interstate transportation
                                          4


of stolen vehicles and t.heft of shipments moving in interstate com­
merce ,,,,,hich though local in nature are subject to concurrent juris­
diction. A major cause for this lapse in prosecution stems from a lack
of state funds to meet extradition costs and state witness fees.
   The Committee advised the Conference that it believes the pri­
mary responsibility for initiating legislation relating to the use of
federal appropriation of such funds for use by the states rests with
the Department of Justice and, accordingly, the Conference agreed
{,nat no action should be taken by the judiciary.

AUTHORIZATION OF           M ..<\GISTRATES     TO USE PROVISION OF YOUTH
                               CoRRECTIONS       ACT
  Judge Zirpoli advised that the Committee had been requested to
comment on a draft bill prepared in the Department of Justice to
amend Section 3401 of Title 18, United States Code, to use the pro­
visions of the Youth Corrections Act when placing young offenders
on probation. In the interest of grea.ter cladty and the avoidance
of any need to refer to other sections of Title 18, the Committee
redrafted and the Conference approved a new draft of the proposed
legislation, as follows:
                                      A BILL
To amend section 3401 of Title 18, United Stat('s Code.
  B(' it ('nacted by the Senate and House of R('lH'esentatives of til(' Vllited States
of America in Congl'eHl'i assembled, thnt section 3401 of ':l'itle U;, Unit('(l States
Code, is amended by ridcl!ng at the end tllel'eof the following:
       .• (g) If a United States magistrate has SU811ended the imposition or execu­
    tion of sentence and placed an offender under 26 years of age at the time of
    conviction on probation, he may thereafter, in his discretion, unconditionally
    disehal'ge such offender from probation prior to the maximum· period of
    llroliation theretofore fixed, which discharge shall automatically set aside the
    convi(·tion, Hnd the magistrate shall issue to the offender n eertilicate to that
    effect."
          DISMISSAL OF INDICTMENTS IN FUGITIVE CASES

   The Department of Justice'has protested that proposed local rules
of some district courts provide for the dismissal of indictments
pending for more than one year where the defendants charged are
fugitives. The Conference noted that. the Department of Justice
is of the view that such dismissals might be det.rimental to the
enforcement of the criminal law and the administration of justice
and would leavethegovermilent no basis on which to seek extra­
dition after the expiration of one year.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee proposal to dis­
                                   5


approve the use of local rules which do not provide the United
States Attorney with an opportunity to show cause why such indict­
ments of fugitives should not be dismissed.
                PRoPOSED FEDERAL CRIl\HNAL CODE

   The Conference was advised that the Oommittee has held several
meetings and conferred with several members and others of the
Xational Commission on Reform of the Federal Criminal Law in
studying Part A of the proposed new criminal code. The Commit­
tee submitted to the Conference tentative comments on Part A for
study by the Conference members and for discussion at a subse­
quent session of the Conference.

             COMMITTEE ON HABEAS CORPUS
   The report of the Committee on Ha.beas Corpus was submitted
to the Conference by the Chairman, Judge Walter E. Hoffman.
   The Committee had referred to it by Congressional committees
H.R. 13722 and S. 3264, bills which would considerably restrict the
range of Constitutional rights which may now be the basis for
habeas:corpus relief and would substantially repeal existing legis­
lation as interpreted by the Supreme Oourt. It would remove as a
basis for habeas corpus relief, questions involving the volunta,rilless
of confessions, the legality of searches and seizures, unfair identi­
fication and many other areas. These issues would be left for trial
court determinatiorrsubject to direct appeaL
   The Conference was in .agreement with the Committee recom­
mendation that these legislative proposals are essentially matters
involving ~ policy decision in the area of federal-state relations and.
therefore,. the Conference agreed that it is for the Congress to
determin~ whether the concept of habeas corpus should be altered.
COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY
                SYSTEM
  Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman, presen:ted the Committee's
report to the Conference.
                           SIZE OF JURIES

  The Conference approved a bill now pending in. the Congress,
H.R. 13496. to provide for juries of six in civil cases3nd to. reduce
                                  6


peremptory challenges in such cases from three to two. The bill
was drafted in pursuance of prior Judicial Conference action at its
March and October sessions (1971) (see Conf. Rept., pp. 5 and 41).

                 CoMMUNICATIONS WITH JURORS

   The Committee advised that it had studied S. 2588, a bill which
would make it a crime for persons associated with the defense in
a criminal trial to question jurors without permission of the court.
A special subcommittee, chaired by Judge Bratton, had studied
this bill and other approa,ches to the problem of communications
with jurors. A majority of the subcommittee, based on a general
survey of the courts, was persuaded that the problem should be
handled on a district-by-district basis without the necessity of
a general rule.
   After hearing the report of the Committee and its subcommittee,
the Conference agreed to disapprove 8. 2588 and to authorize the
Director of the Administrative Office to transmit to each United
States district court for its information a copy of the Bratton
subcommittee report, together with a recommendation of the Con­
ference to each district court that it consider the problem of com­
munications with· jurors to determine whether a specific rule is
needed in that district and that notice be given to jurors, counsel
and the parties of any rule adopted.
            AUTOMATION OF JURY SELECTION PROCESS

   The Conference was advised that very slow progress has been
made in converting eligible districts to automated selection, with
eight out of a possible 25 districts having thus far converted. Some
progress is being made toward conversion in five additional dis~
tricts but it is hoped that'this progress can now be substantially
accelerated, based on the success achieved in· ,the eight districts
now completely automated.
                  EFFICIENT JUROR UTILIZATION

   The first of the reports prepared by the Director of the Admin­
istrative Office for periodic circulation to the chief judges entitled
ttJuror Utilization in the United States Courts" was circulated in
October. The report contains comparative costs and usage statistics
by districts; Prior to the issuance of the Administrative Office
                                   7


report, a four-months' study in depth of juror utilization in the
Southern and Eastern Districts of New York had been undertaken
under the joint auspices of the Institute of Judicial Administration
and the Federal Judicial Center. At its October 1971 session the
Conference agreed that the suggestions contained in the report of
this survey should be implemented in any judicial district where,
in the opinion of the judges, the suggestions would improve the
juror usage efficiency. To implement these recommendations, the
Judicial Council of the Second Circuit sponsored a workshop in
January 1972 for the judges and clerks of the Eastern and South­
ern Districts of New York, as a result of which the Conference
was advised that significant improvement in juror utiliza,tion pro­
cedures resulted. It was agreed that the success of this demonstra­
tion might well be emulated in all circuits.

    COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

              BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM 

  The Committee report was presented to the Conference by its
Chairman, Judge Edward Weinfeld.

                SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

   The Committee had considered the recommendations contained
in the survey report of the Director of the Administrative Office,
 dated January 12, 1972, as well as the recommendations of the
circuit councils and district judges concerned for the authorization
for continuation of new six-year terms for 17 referee positions to
become vacant by expiration of terms. The Conference approved
the Committee report and recommendations, except as noted be­
low, all to be effective May 1, 1972,' unless otherwise indicated
and subject to the availability of funds.                        .
   The exceptiot:l noted is the recommendation for immediate
authorization for an increase in saJaries of all full-time referees
in bankruptcy by 5.5 percent as permitted generaJIy for govern­
ment employees under Section 3(d) of the Economic Stabilization
Act of December 22, 1971. The Conference took the position that
the referees' salaries should be increased by the 5.5 percent formula
but only at such time as the salaries of United States magistrates
are brought to a comparable position with the salaries of full-time
referees in bankruptcy.

        present.
   In approving the foregoing, the Conference noted that there
were two recommendations made by respective courts which were
not approved by the Bankruptey Division or the Committee. The
Committee had agreed that no recommendations should be made
for the continuance of the third full-time referee position at Mem­
phis because of the decline in the volume of business, and, secondly,
the Committee did not concur in a recommendation that the part­
time referee position for the District of Delaware be increased to
a full-time service, being of the view that the temporary emergency
situation· could be handled by the assignment of another referee
within the circuit to assist with the workload of the bankruptcy
court in Wilmington.
   The Conference agreed that the part-time referee position at
Baton Rouge be designated as a part-time referee for the Middle
District of Louisiana as defined by Public Law 92:-208, effec­
tive April 16, J972; at the same time the authorization of the
part-time referee position in the Eastern District of Louisiana is
revoked.
   The two-year salary rule for referees, Section 40(b) of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, now provides that the salary of a full-time referee shall
                                      11 


not be changed more often than once in any two years. The Con­
ference agreed with the recommendation of the Committee that
such a salary limitation is not warranted and agreed to recommend
to the Congress the repeal of that portion of Section 40(b) of
the Bankruptcy Act which limits the changes in the salary of full­
time referees to not more than once in any two years.
   The Conference agreed further to instruct its Select Committee,
created at the October 1971 session (Conf. Rept., p. 66) to apprise
the 1972 Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Sal­
aries of the problems presented by Section 4O(b) of the Bankruptcy
Act in respect to salary increases for referees.
   The Conference also noted that the Committee had requested
the Director of the Administrative Office to solicit an opinion
from the Comptroller General regarding the effect of Section 4O(b)
on a general increase for referees as opposed to the individual in­
creases contemplated by the Bankruptcy Act.

                               LEGISLATION

  The Conference agreed with the Committee recommendation
that it reaffirmits support of H.R. 4815 and S. 1396; bills to permit
a full-time referee to serve as a part-time magistrate. The Con­
ference also reaffirmed its support of H.R. 4769, a bill to increase
the terms of office of full-time referees in bankruptcy from six
to twelve years and to provide for mandatory retirement for all
referees at age 70. The Conference agreed that this legislation need
not be delayed by reason of the existence of the Commission to
study thebankruptcy laws.

                         CHAPTER      XIII   CASES

   The Committee reported that i~had observed that certain stand­
ing Chapter XIII trustees had advertised in the classified columns
of local newspapers as a means of counteracting the effective
advertising by private groups recommending their own counsel­
ing service in lieu of Chapter XIU: After studying this problem,
the Conference agreed on the adoption of an additional guideline
for the:administration of Chapter XIII, as follows:
   15. 	That it is the sense of the Oonference t:qat Chapter XIII trustees
        shQuld refrain from (a) advertising in newspapers or other public infor­
                                     12 

      mation media, and (b) taking any other action which reasonably may
      be interpreted as directly soliciting debtors to file wage-eamer proceed­
      ings under Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act.

                      SEMINARS FOR REFEREES
  The Conference was advised that the Eighth National Seminar
for Newly-Appointed Referees in Bankruptcy will be held in Wash­
ington in the fall of 1972. Since the last session of the Conference,
four regional seminars have been held-in Cleveland, New York
City, San Francisco and New Orleans.

             REFEREES' SALARY AND EXPENSE FUND
   Payments into the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund have
not equaled disbursements since 1966. In 1971 the surplus accumu­
lated in prior years was exhausted and it was necessary to obtain
$2,857,836 from the General Fund of the Treasury to meet ex­
penses. A deficit of over $5,000,000 is anticipated in the current
fiscal year. The Conference agreed with a Committee recommenda­
tion that the Conference adhere to its previous position and recom­
mendation that it is no longer possible to maintain adequate
payments in the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund without plac­
ing an inordinate burden upon the bankrupts and the assets of
bankrupt estates and that the Referees'. Salary and Expense Fund
should be abolished. The Conference agreed to advise the Con­
gress that to maintain the fund in balance would require heavy
increases in the filing fees and increased percentage charges under
the Act.
    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  Judge Francis L. Van Dusen, Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee on· the Administration of the Probation System.

                      SENTENCING INSTITUTES
  The Conference approved ,the proposed agenda of a First and
Second Circuit Sentencing Institute planned for the fall of 1972.
Representatives of the Department of Justice had previously
a.pproved the agenda.
   TheConference further approved a joint sentencing institute to
be held in the Eighth and Tenth Circuits after June 30, 1973, and
                                   13 


agreed to. pro.ceed with plans fo.r a tentative institute to. be held
thereafter jo.intly in the Fo.urth and Fifth Circuits.

      EXPEDITING PREPARATION o.F PRESENTENCE REFORTS

  The Conference was advised that the Co.mmittee had ado.pted a
reso.lutio.n advising district judges and chief pro.batio.n o.fficers that
The Presentence Investigation, Mo.no.graph 103, sho.uld be used no.t
as a strict guide to the co.ntent o.f presentence repo.rts but in a flexi­
ble fashio.n in o.rder to. reduce the length o.f the presentence reports
and expedite their availability to the sentencing judge. The co.m­
mittee had agreed to make sho.rter forms of presentence repo.rts
available to the judges and pro.batio.n o.fficers to. assist in securing
greater flexibility and pro.mpter preparatio.n o.f presentence reports.

                              LEGISLATION

   The Co.nference next co.nsidered a pro.Po.sal emanating fro.m the
Bureau o.f Priso.ns fo.r a draft bill to. amend 18 U.S.C. 3655. This pro.­
posal Wo.uld, amo.ng o.ther things, give clear autho.rity to pro.batio.n
o.fficers upon request o.f the Attorney General or his designee to. fur­
nish information about and supervision o.f persons within the cus­
tody o.f the Attorney General while in the community o.n wo.rk re­
lease, furlo.ugh o.r o.ther autho.rized release fro.m their regular place
o.f confinement. The Conference agreed to qualify its approval o.f
this pro.Posal by the proviso. that the Congress make adequate pro­
vision for additio.nal pro.bation o.fficers to. assume this burden, except
in such areas where they are now adequately staffed to. do. so.
   The Co.nference next considered R.ll. 13118 and agreed that the
Co.mtnittee sho.uld give further co.nsideratio.n to. the o.verall pro.­
Po.sals co.ntained in the bill, the overall purpose o.f which is to
establish an independent Board 6f Paro.le, to pro.vide fo.r fair and
equitable federal paro.le procedures, to establish a Natio.nal Paro.le
Institute, and to:prDvide asSistance to. the states fo.r the o.peration
Df fair and adequately staffed paro.le systems. The Conference
agreed, hDwever, that its primary concern was with Section 4221 o.f
the proPo.sed bill entitled "Judicial Remedies" which woli1d Jimpo.se
an eno.rmo.US additio.nal burden upon the court system. The Co.n­
ference' agreed that if the Co.nstitutio.nal rightso.f a paro.lee are
infringed, he has an adequate remedy under ~xisiing pro.visio.ns o.f
the United States Code.                                     <

               INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman of the Committee on Intercir­
cuit Assignments, reported on the work of his committee for the
period covering September 1,1971 to February 15, 1972.
  During the period in question the Committee recommended 51
assignments to be undertaken by 37 judges. Of this number three
are circuit judges in active status, five are senior circuit judges, 12
are district judges in active status and 14 are senior district judges.
One active judge of the Customs Court and two retired Supreme
Court Justices participated in six assignments.
  There were 24 assignments to the circuit courts of appeals during
this period. Five senior circuit judges, six senior distriot judges and
one retired Supreme Court Justice assisted in carrying out these
assignments. There was one assignment to the Court of Claims
carried out by a retired Supreme Court Justice and 26 assignments
to the distriot court:&, of which 10 were carried out by senior judges.

      COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL 

               MAGISTRATES ACT 

 Judge Charles M. Metzner, Chairman of the Committee to Imple­
ment the Federal Magistrates Act, presented the report of the
Committee.
                          SALARY INCREASE

   The Committee reported that the Director of the Administrative
Office had recommended that the 5.5 percent ,comparability salary
increase authorized in the 1971 amendments to the EconomicStabi­
lization Act of 1970 be authorized for full-time and part-time
United States magistrates to the extent permitted by law. Statutory
ceilings on the salary of full-time and .part-time ;magistrates, of
CQUrBe, cannot be exceeded. The increase is intended to apply to
the salaries of all magistrates, except that the salary of the part­
time magistrate at Redding, California, may not exceed $500 per
a]lnum. The increase wi11also be applied to the sa~es approved by
the Conferen<f6 at its ~on last October, hut only when appro- .
priated. funds are ~va.ilable. Meanwhile, the increase will apply to
the current salaries of these magistrates. Upon recommendation of
the Committee,·· the Conferen~ approved the pay increase in ac­
cordance with the schedule appended to the Committee's report.

                               MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

   The Committee reported that it had considered various requests
for the creation of additional magistrate positions, changes in
sala,ries of magistrates and changes in arrangements. These re­
quests have also been considered by the judicial councils of the
circuits. In a,ccordance with the recommendations of the Com­
mittee, the Conference approved the following changes in the
numbers, locations, arrangements and salaries of magistrates and
directed that, unless otherwise noted, these changes be made effec­
tive at such time as appropriated funds are available.

                        PROCEDURES MANUAL

    Judge Metzner presented to the Conference a draft of Part I of
 the Procedures Manual for United States Magistrates which had
been reviewed by the Conunittee. The draft had been prepared in
 accordance with 28 U.S.C. 604(d) (4) which requires that the
 Director of the Administrative Office, under the supervision and
 direction of the Conference, "prepare and distribute a manual
 .... * for the use of such officers which shall set forth their powers
and duties, describe all categories of proceedings that may arise
before them, and contain such other information as may be required
to enable them to discharge their powers and duties promptly,
effectively and impartially."
    Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference au­
thorized the Director of the Administrative Office to distribute a
copy of Part I of the Procedures Manual for United States Magis':'
trates to all magistrates and interested officials and further author­
ized the Director, with the approval of the Committee, to issue
annual supplements and periodic revisions.

                   ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

  The Committee submitted proposed changes to the regulations
of the Director of the Administrative Office which are designed
to clarify and give more flexibility in the administration of the
magistrates system. Upon recommendation of the Committee the
Conference approved the changes submitted with the Committee
report.
                       NAME OF COMMITTEE

  The Committee pointed out that the United States magistrate
system had become fully effective throughout the federaljudicia,ry
on July 1, 1971. As a result the official title of the Committee, which
indicates that its purpose is to implement the Federal Magistrates
Act, no longer seems appropriate. Accordingly, the Conference
voted to change the official name of the Committee to "Committee
on the Administration of the Federal Magistrates System."
   JUVENILE DELINQUENTS CHARGED WITH PETTY OFFENSES

  Upon recommendation of the Committee a proposal to amend
the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act to make it inapplicable in
                                 19 

petty offense cases was referred to the Committee on the Adminis­
tration of the Criminal Law for study and report to the Conference.

                        COURT REPORTERS

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, in­
structed the Director of the Administrative Office to refer all
requests for court reporter services to the Conference Subcom­
mittee on Supporting Personnel.

                     CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

  The Committee reported that questions have arisen on matters
of judicial ethics and conflicts of interest involving United States
magistrates. The problems of full-time magistrates are similar, if
not identical, to those of United States district judges which are
now considered by the Interim Advisory Committee on Judicial
Activities. Problems of part-time magistrates arise primarily in
connection with the conflict-of-interest rules recommended by the
.Magistrates Committee and approved by the ConferenCe in 1969.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference di­
rected that questions of ethics and conflicts of interest involving
full-time magistrates be referred to the Interim Advisory Commit­
tee on Judicial Activities and authorized the Magistrates Commit­
tee to consider and render advice to part-time magistrates on
questions of conflicts of interest.

    COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                JUSTICE ACT 

   In the absence of the Chairman, Judge John S. Hastings, the
Committee report was presented by Judge Hatfield Chilson.
   The Conference noted and authorized for.distribution the report
of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts on appointments and payments under th~ Act for the six­
month period ending December 31; 1971. D1,lring this first half of
fiscal year 1972, there were 20,431 persons for whom counsel were
appointed, an increase of about 20 percent over the same period of
the previous year. These appointments do ~otinclude cases as­
signed to federal public defender or community defender organiza­
tions operating unaer sustaining grants. During the same period
                                        20 


there were approximately 900 discretionary appointments under
the new subsection (g) of the Act for probation aud parole viola­
tors, habeas corpus petitioners and the like. The sum of $197,826
was authorized for transcript, expert and other services.

                   PUBLIC DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS

   The Conference noted that in addition to the seven public de­
fender organizations in operation at its Last session (Con£. Rept.,
p. 55), a public defender organization had become operational and
was functioning in the District of Connecticut, with headquarters
at Hartford.
               COMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIO::-IS

   The Conference was advised that two community defender orga­
nizations applied for and received grants since those reported to the
Conference at the last session (Con£. Rept.. p. 56). The applica­
tions as recommended by the Conference committee and approved
oy the Executive Committee of the Conference for payment were:
    (1) 	An  initial grant in the sum of $12.624und a sustaining grant In the snm
         of $11)5,000 on an unnunl basis to the Philadelpbla Defender Organiza­
         tion, and
    (2) 	 An initial grant in the sum of $43,000 an<l a sUstaining grant of $224.000
         for the period Murch I-June SO, 1972. to the Federal Defender Services
         Unit of the Legal Aid Society, New York CIty. which serves the Southern
         District of New York and the Eastern District of New York.

              SINGLE TRIAL OF SEPARATE INDICTMENTS

  The Conference noted a situation presented to the Committee
which 3ro~e in one district court in which the same defendant was
indicted on three separate occasions for three allegedly different
acts of armed robbery of a'national bank. These cases were handled
throughout the pretrial period as separate cases until defendant,
after· considerable investigation by his coun'sel, agreed to plead
guilty to lesser included offeilses. At that time the three cases were
heard together and separate sentences were awarded in each rose.
The Conference noted that the Committee ruled that separate
vouchers could appropriately be filed in each case but that counsel
could not charge separately for time spent on all three cases; he
can prorate such. time, cross-referencing each case on his vouchers,
but time spent exclusinly on anyone case may properly be charged
on the voucher for that case.
                                 21

         CONTINUED ApPOINTMENT OF SAME COUNSEL

   The Conference was advised of an inquiry emanating from the
Senate District of Columbia Appropriations Committee which re­
vealed that a number of attorneys assigned in the District of Colum­
bia had earned very large sums during the past two years as
assigned counsel appointed under the Criminal Justice Act. The
Conference agreed that such a practice 'was contrary to the Congres­
sional intent expressed in the Act and contrary to the plans adopted
in virtually every district and circuit requiring the establishment
of a panel ofatt.orneys and rotation of appointment of attorneys
from the panel. Accordingly, the Conference resolved that the Ad­
ministrative Office should determine on a quarterly basis the names
of any attorneys appointed under the Act who during that quarter
were paid more than $1,000 and report such facts to the chief judges
of the circuits involved.

                RETIREMENT OF JUDGE HASTI::-;GS

   The Conference noted that Judge Hastings had asked to be re­
lieved of his duties as Chairman of the Committee at the close of
the Conference. The Conference noted that Judge Hastings had
chaired the three-judge committee which was created to prepare
the ,vay for the new Criminal Justice Act and that, after complet­
ing that task, began in 1964 the Chairmanship of the new nine­
judge committee, which also administered the Criminal Justice Act
as newly amended in 1970. The Conference voted to express to
Judge Hastings its appreciation for his long and faithful service
as Chairman of the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice
Act.
        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
  The report of the Committee on Rules of f'ractice and Procedure
was presented to the Conference by the Chairman, Judge Albert
B. Maris.
                        ADMIRALTY RULES

  The Conference· was advised that t.he Advisory Committe€ on
Admiralty Rules had been kept in existence for six years for the
purpose of studying the. effect. of the merged maritime and civil
pract,ice upon admiralty litigation and to recommend any changes
in the COi,libimid procedure and any improvements in the new Sup­
plemental Admiralty Ruleswhich might be indicated. Judge Maris
                                 22 


stated, however, that no such need had developed and, accordingly,
the O:mference agreed with the Committee recommenda;tion that
the Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules be discharged.
                         CRIMINAL RULES

   The Conference approved for transmittal to the Supreme Court,
with a recommendation for favorable action, proposed amendments
to the following rules of criminal procedure-I, 3, 4(b) and (c), 5,
5.1, 6(b), 7(c), 9 (b), (c) and (d), 17 (a) and (g), 31(e), 32(b),
38(a), 40,41,44,46,54, and 55. In so doing, the Conference noted
that the principal objective of the changes now proposed was to
conform the existing oriminal rules to statutory changes. The Con­
ference likewise approved for transmitrtal to the Supreme Court a
proposed amendment to Rule 9 (c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure.
                     SALARY COMMITTEE
   At the October 1971 session of the Conference it was agreed that
the Salary Committee should undertake a study of graded positions
in the judiciary, meeting jointly with the Subcommittee on Sup­
porting PersonneL This study was undertaken and the joint report
was presented to the Oonference by Judge Milton Pollack, Chruir­
man of the Subcommittee on Supporting PersonneL
   The report found that the classifiootions and salaries of the graded
positions in the oourtsare now on a reasonable parity with those
of comparable positions inside and outside the federal government
service. The Conference agreed with a Committee recommendation
0) that the Administrative Office study the position of senior ad­
ministrative secretary to the chief judge of any la.rge circuit or dis­
trict court to determine whether an increase is due such personnel,
and (2) that the Administrative Office cOnduct studies of the clerk's
office in each court of appeals for the purpose of determining the .
need for intermediate supervisory claanfications in order to achieve
an adequ8Jte and reascmablespan of supervisory oontrol.
   The Conference noted further that the joint report found that
the salaries of federal court reportel"S, at presellt and as projected,
are reasonable and adequate.                       .
                    REVIEW COMMITTEE
  The Chairman of the Review Committee, Judge Edward A.
Tamm, presen¥d the report of the Oommittee.
                                          23 


  The Review Committee examined reports of 583 of the 596 fed­
eral judges which were filed after the close of the second half of
calendar year 1971. Pursuant to the resolution of the Conference
at its March 1971 session (ConL Rept., p. 24), Judge Tamm re­
ported that 13 judges did not file reports for the period July I-De­
cember 31,1971, as follows; *

     INTERIM ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL 

                   ACTIVITIES 

  Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman of the Committee, reported
that since the last session of the Conference the Committee had
published no written reports. It has, however, advised individual
judges in several matters by separate correspondence. Judge Tuttle
advised that one reason for withholding written reports has been
the imminence of the publication of new standards by the American
                                 24 


Bar Association's Special Comnrittee on Standards of Judicial
Conduct. As a result of the deliberations of the Conference it was
resolved that the Review Committee. chaired by Judge Tamm,
and the Interim Advisory Committee on Judicial Activities, chaired
by Judge Tuttle. should combine for the purpose of examining
the report of the ABA's Special Committee which is expected to
be approved by the House of Delegates of the American Bar Asso­
ciation in August 1972. The combined Committee is charged with
reporting back to the Judicial Conference on the feasibility of
adopting this report as applying to all federal judges and to deter­
mine whether any additional standards may be needed in the
federal system.

       COMlVIITTEE ON COFRT ADMINISTRATION
  Judge Robert A. Ainsworth. Jr., Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on Court Administration.

                  JUDICIAL SURVIVORS' ANNUITY

   Judge Ainsworth advised the Conference that hearings have been
held before the Senate Subcommittee on Improvements in Judi­
cial Machinery on S. 2854, a bill designed to bring Supreme Court
justices under the coverage of Section 376 of Title 28, United States
Code. This bill would also increase from $5,000 to $10,000 the
anlJuity applicable to present .widows of justices as provided in 28
U.S.C. 375. With respect to active justices or those resigned
or retired who are receiving salary under 28 U.S.C. 371, a six-month
election period is provided within which period each such justice
shall elect either (a) to continue under Section 375 at the present
$5,000 rate or (b) become subject to Section 376. In the event of
an election to come under Section 376, the justice must make the
deposit required by Section 376(c). All justices appointed after
the date of enaetment. will automatically come under Section 376.
   Judge Ainsworth advised the Conference that because of the
imminence of the hearings at the time the Committee on Court
Administration met, it was decided to recommend· approval of
S. 2854 and to request the Executive Committee of the Conference
to take immediate action. The·Executive Committee promptly
expressed its concurrence therewith.
                                 25
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

   The Conference concurred in a recommendation of the Commit­
tee to approve S. 3015, a bill to provide for a temporary additional
judgeship for the Western District of \Visconsin. The Conference
agreed that despite the fact that the quadrennial survey of district
judgeship needs was now in progress, there was no doubt that an
emergency situation existed in Western \Visconsin requiring at
least one additional judgeship as promptly as possible.
   The Conference was advised that the Committee, through its
Subcommittee on Judicial Statistics, had considered other legis­
lative proposals to create additional district judgeships but was
in agreement that none of these involved an emergency situation
and, accordingly, voted to defer consideration of all other pro­
posals until completion of the quadrennial survey.

            LEGISLATION REGARDING FIDELITY LOSSES

   The Conference considered a recommendation of the Committee
for approval, "vith certain changes, of legislation proposed by the
Treasury Department to provide that the federal government
should assume the risks of its fidelity losses. The Conference noted
that the legislation as drafted would leave unprotected or haw
the federal government assume losses in situations, for example,
where the clerk of court holds private funds pursuant to court
order. By proposing certain minor amendments to the bill, the
Conference agreed that this situation could be covered.

              COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
   Judge Carl Weinman, Chairman of the Budget Committee.
reported to the Conference that the appropriations hearings before
both the House and the Senate had taken place but that 110 appro­
priations bill had yet been presented by the committees to the
Congress.
   Judge Weinman, on behalf of the Committee, suggested that
the Conference consider revising its schedule of fall meetings
so that there would be ample opportunity for the Conference to
review the report of the Budget Committee and the justifications
prior to submission to the Office of Management and Budget on
October 15.
                                 26 

PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS
   The Conference approved the pretermission of terms of courts
of appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, for those sessions of the Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to be held at Asheville, North
Carolina, and those terms of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit which might be held in places other than St. Louis prior
to the next session of the Conference.

           RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
   The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
on matters considered at this session where necessary for legisla­
tive or administrative action.
