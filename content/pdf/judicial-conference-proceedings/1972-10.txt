ing of the first session on matters relating to the activities of the
Department of Justice andtJhe federal judiciary.
   The Honorable Alfred P. Murrah, Director of the Federal Judi­

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
     OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
  The Direotor of the Administrative Office, Mr. Kirks, presented
his annual report and was authorized by the Conference to release
the preliminary edition immediately in mimeograph form and to
revise and supplement the final printed edition.
  nOn designation of the Chief Justice, Judge Pat Meha.1fy attended the Con­
ference for Chief Judge Matthes who was unable to be present.
                                 31 

   In his report Mr. Kirks pointed out that the upward trend in the
workload of the courts of appeals and the district courts continued
throughout fiscal year 1972. In the courts of appeals case filings
rose 13.7 percent over the prior year and in the district courts civil
case filings were up three percent and criminal case filings were up
13.7 percent. Despite these increases in filings, Mr. Kirks reported
that the federal courts have made substantial gains in the disposi­
tion of cases. In the courts of appeals the judges terminated 11.8
percent more cases in 1972 than in 1971. In the district courts the
civil case terminations rose ten percent and oriminal case termina­
tions were 21.5 percent higher than in 1971.
   Utilization of petit jurors improved over the rate of the previous
year. Although there was a 9.2 percent rise in the number of juror
days served, there was a decrease of 3.1 percent in petit juror days
not used. As a result, total petit juror payments declined 2.7 per­
cent. It is estimated that in the Southern District of New York
alone, the dollSil' savings in improved juror utilization was approxi­
mately $278,000.
   Mr. Kirks reported that in the first full year of operation of the
federal magistrates syStem some 237,522 separate items of business
were disposed of by the magistrates. This included the disposition
of 72,082 minor offenses in addition to the discharging of several
other funotians assigned to the magistrates.
   In the bankruptcYa'I'ea, case filings deoreased substantially, by
9.2 percent. In the probation system the continual increases noted
over the past several years again characterized 1972, with presen­
tence investigation reports up 17.4 percent and the number of per­
sons received for supervision increasing by 16.3 percent.
  Mr. Kirks advised the Conference that fiscal year 1972 mSil'ked
the inauguration of the circuit executive program. He said that the
Board of Certification, after several meetings and a most diligent
screening process, certified 52 nominees. At the close of the year
eight oircuits had selected circuit executives.

                COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
  The report of the Committee on the Budget w.a,s presented by the
Chairman, Chief Judge Carl Weinman.
  The budget report had earlier been circu1ated to the members of
the Conference and approved by vote slip because of the statutory
necessity of SUbmitting the budget to the Office of Management and
     492-122--78----2
                                 32 

Budget prior to October 15. In addition to the budget originally
approved, the Conference voted to include a request for 340 addi­
tional probation officers. Judge Weinman advised the Conference
that in 1972 the sum available from appropriations for the opera­
tion of the coUTts, the Administrwtive Office and the Federal Judi­
cial Center aggregated $171,264,000. The annual appropriation for
fiscal year 1973 whicll was authorized just prior to the convening of
the Conference totalled $182,783,000.
   Included in the 1973 appropriation is funding for 168 additional
probation officers as well as 84 clerk-stenographer positions for the
probation service. Also included are funds for 27 secretaries for
those circuits which specifically requested secretarial pools. Special
provision was also made for the employment of additional person­
nel by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to be allocated by
the Chief Judge and the Director of the Administrative Office to
take care of the temporary situation which the Appropriations
Committee found to exist in that circuit. The sum of $14,500,000
was appropriated for the appointment of counsel and the operation
of defender organizations under the Criminal Justice Act. For sal­
aries of referees $6,991,000 was appropriated, thus permitting in­
creases in the salaries of full-time referees from $30,000 to $31,650.
Congress also approved a supplemental appropriation for fiscal
year 1973 to permit increases in the salaries of 87 full-time magis­
trates from $22,500 to $30,000, one full-time magistrate from
$14,000 to $16,000 and 37 part-time magistrates from $11,000 to
$12,000.
   Judge Weinman advised that the 1973 Appropriation Act pro­
vided a limitation of $1,000,000 for the fees and expenses of counsel
appointed under the Criminal Justice Act by the District of Colum­
bia Court of Appeals and the Superior Court of the District of Co­
lumbia. As a result thereof and in view of the fact that the House
Appropriations Committee had originally denied any funds under
the Criminal Justice Act for these two courts, Judge Weinman
proposed that in the future the Director of the Administrative Of­
fice confer with the appropriate court officials of the District of
Columbia government so that appropriations for the appointment
of counsel in these local courts be requested through the District
of Columbia appropriations.

      COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
 Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
Court Administration, presented the committee's report.
                   PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

   The Conference approved a recommendation of the committee
and reaffirmed its position that no new places of holding court
shall be approved in the abs611ce of a showing of a strong and
compelling need; further, when a Congressional or other request
is received and before referral to a committee of the Conference,
the Administrative Office shall first seek the views of the chief
judge of the district involved and of the judicial council of the
circuit as to the merits of the proposal. Only if the proposal meets
with the approval of both and supporting data are provided shall
the proposal be referred to the committee of the Conference.
   The Conference disapproved H.R. 5595 to add Pineville as a
place of holding court in the Eastern District of Kentucky and
S. 3006, adding Bennington as a place of holding court in the Dis­
trict of Vermon t.
                  CoURT OF ApPEALS OPINIONS

   The Confereneeapproved the recommendation of the committee
directing the Administrative Office to confer with the West Pub­
lishing Company so as to show on each published court of appeals
opinion the date of argument and the date of the opinion.
   The Conference approved the circulation to all circuit judges of
the detailed recommendation of the Board of the Federal Judicial
Center concerning the publication of opinions of the courts of
appeals. It requested each circuit to develop an opinion publication
plan by January 1, 1973. These plans are to be submitted to the
Committee on Court Administration for consideration and report
back to the Conference at the April 1973 meeting.
                NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE

  The Conference approved the concept of a National Institute of
Justice as contained in S. 3612, 92nd Congress. The Conference
deferred consideration or comment as to the implementation of the
proposal inasmuch as the American Bar Association is currently
undertaking a feasibility study in connection with the proposal.
                                     34

                           TERRITORIAL JUDGES

   The Conference considered and disapproved H.R. 14169, .It bill
which provides a formula under the terms of which the total per
annum rate of salary or proportion of salary payable to a judge of a
territory or possession of the United States under 28 U.S.C. 373
shall be increased periodically by one percent, plus the present per­
cent rise in the consumer price index. The Conference was of the
view that if the proposal is meritorious it should also apply to a
justice or judge who resigns under the provisions of Section 371 (a)
of Title 28. The Conference also noted that under the proposed
legislation a territorial judge who would resign and then receive a
cost of living increase shortly thereafter would be receiving retire­
ment benefits greater than the salary of an active judge.

                        ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  Judge Ainsworth advised the Oonference that the committee had
made a thorough study of the report of its Subcommittee on Judi­
cial StJatiati~ based on the completion of the quadrennial survey
of the need for additional district judges in the federal court system.
Based on this careful analysis of statistical data, the Conference
approved recommendations for additional judgeships in the district
courts as follows:
                                                                    Additional
                                                                    Judgeships

  The Conference further reiterated its support of a bill endorsed at
the October 1971 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 81)
for the establishment of ten additional circuit judgeships. The Con­
ference noted also that since the quadrennial survey of the needs
of the courts of appeals had been conducted the case filings in the
                                           36 


Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit have risen markedly and
agreed that one additional circuit judgeship should be created in the
Sixth Circuit. Thus, the Conference agreed to recommend to the
Congress the esetablishment of the following circuit judgeships:

SENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE SECRETARY TO A CHIEF JUDGE

   The Conference disapproved a request for the establishment of
a position of senior administrative secretary to the chief judge of
any large district or circuit court. In so doing, it noted that the po­
sition of circuit executive has now been established and it is fair to
assume that the circuit executive will take many of the adminis­
trative burdens of the chief judge of the circuit.

COURTROOM DEPUTY CLERKS FOR SENIOR DISTRICT JUDGES

   The Conference agreed with the recommendation of the com­
mittee that there is no need to establish a position of courtroom
deputy clerk for a senior district judge. Any senior district judge is
entitled to courtroom deputy services in all courtroom proceedings
and the furnishing of such assistance is the responsibility of the
clerk's office. For this reason, a specific position need not be estab­
lished since this is clearly a responsibility which every clerk's office
must provide.

ADDITIONAL MANAGERIAL/ SUPERVISOR GRADES IN CLERKS' OFFICES

  The Conference authorized the following managerial/supervisor
grades from among existing clerks' offices in the courts of appeals,
subject to availability of funds and with allocation control in the
Administrative Office, as follows:

SECRETARY TO THE CIRCUIT EXECUTIVE

   The Conference approved qualification standards for the position
of secretary to the circuit executive.

COURT REPORTERS

   The Conference noted that the Board of the Federal Judicial
Center has recommended the adoption of a policy to the effect that
efficient management of court reporting takes precedence over the
exclusive assignment of one reporter for each judge; that proce­
dures for supervising and assigning reporters in multidistrict courts
be established and completed with a view to equalizing distribution
of the workload; and that the Conference undertake to establish
improved qualification and production standards, as well as stand­
ards for the expected number of hours per day which should be
spent reporting court proceedings. After a study of these recom­
mendations and the committee's further recommendations, the
Conference adopted an integrated policy aimed at improving court
reporter services in the federal judicial system; specifically, a certi­
fication process for all reporter personnel, production standards and
a plan for the supervision, assignment and accountability of re­
porters, the details of which are to be defined by the Director of
the Administrative Office after consultation with the district court
and with the approval of the circuit council.
   The Conference approved an increase in the number of court
reporters assigned to the Southern District of New York from 28
to 31.
                                 38 

INTERPRETER

  The Conference approved the position of interpreter for the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas at
Brownsville.
                           LEGISLATION

  The Conference considered five bills which it determined involved
primarily matters of legislative policy on which the Conference
should make no comment:
    1. 	 H.R. 15396 which would set up regional small contract
         claims divisions within the Board of Contract Appeals to
         handle claims in amounta not exceeding $50,000;
    2. 	 H.R. 14612 which would provide that claims for damage or
         injury caused by members of the Army or Air National
         Guard shall be allowed under 32 U.S.C. 715;
    3. 	S. 1177 which would establish a council of consumer ad­
         visors-but the impaot of this bill on the judiciary should
         be brought out at legislative hearings;
    4. 	 H.R. 15539 which would make the United States liable for
         court costa and attorneys' fees to persons who prevail in
         actions arising out of ,administrative actions of agenoies of
         the Executive Branch;
    5. 	H.R. 14726 which would amend 41 U.S.C. 321 to provide for
         full adjudication of righta of government contractors in
         courts of la.w.
   The Conference approved H.R. 13645 to authorize the. district
courts to order the service of documents and taking of depositions
in foreign countries upon application of administrative tribunals.
   The Conference approved S. 3653, a bill to .amend the. require­
ment for a three-judge court. In so doing, the Conference noted that
this bill differs from the original recommendation of the Conference
(Conf. Rept., October 1970, p. 78) in that it contains no special
provision giving the Attorney Geneml of the state or of ,the United
States the option of appealing to the appropriate court of appeals
or directly to the Supreme Court.
   The Conference approved :a draft bill submitted by the Office of
Management and Budget to provide that applications to review
final orders of the Civil Service Commission shall be filed in the
Court of Claims or the appropriate court of appeals as provided in
Chapters 91 and 158 of Title 28, United States Code. Approval of
                                       39 

this proposal was conditioned upon certain amendments being
made as follO'ws:
  Page 1:
      Lme 15.-delete "the Court of Claims or"
      Line 16.-substitute "chapter 158" for "chapters 91 and"
      Line n.-insert between "petition" and "may" the following "under this
        chapter"
  Page 2:
      Line 2.-delete .., the Court of Claims or"
  PageS:
      Line 11.-Add as a SEC. 6 the following: "Nothing in this act shall be con­
        strued as affecting or changing in any manner the jurisdiction or proce­
        dure of the Court of Claims as provided in chapters 91 and 165 of title 28,
        United States Code."

                           LAND    CoNDEMNATIO'N
   The Conference noted that the committee had for Bome time been
studying the matter raised by the Division O'f Land and Natural
Resources O'f the Department of Justice concerning the requirement
of sO'me district courts that separate cO'ndemnatiO'n prO'ceedings be
filed for each tract, econO'mic unit O'r ownership O'f land in federal
projects. The Conference was advised that the Department O'f Jus­
tice regards the requirement O'f separate filings as viO'lating both the
letter and spirit of Rule 71 (A) (b) O'f the Federal Rules of Civil
PrO'cedure. The Conference approved seven guidelines to' be used
for a two-year trial period by apprO'ximately six or more district
cO'urts on a vO'lunteer basis. The results of the experiment are to be
reviewed by the Committee O'n CO'urt Administration for recom­
mendations O'f appropriate action in the light of that experience.
In essence, the guidelines prO'vide:
   (1) for each tract, econO'mic unit or ownership for which the just
compensation is required to be separately determined in a total
lump sum, there shall be a separate civil actiO'n file opened by the
clerk, which shall be given a serial number, as are given to other
civil actions. A separate JS 5 card and a separate JS 6 card shall be
prepared on each such action;
   (2) The file in the civil action containing the first complaint filed
in a single declaration of taking shall be designated as the Master
File for all the civil actions based upon the single declaration of
taJring. The n umerica1. designation as the Master File shall be shown
by adding as a suffix to the civil action serial number the symbol
MF-. (In the blank shall be inserted a code number or numbers
     492-122--78----8
                                 40 

designating the project or projects and the number assigned the
declaration of taking with which the property concerned is con­
nected). The single declaration of taking shall be filed in the Master
File only;
   (3) for the civil action designated as the Master File there shall
be a separate complain t;
   (4) a standard form of complaint may be used. In the body of
the oompliaint it shall not be necessary to designate the owner or
owners of the property ooncerned or other parties affected or to
describe the property concerned. These factors may be set forth in
an exhibit incorporated by reference in the standard form of com­
plaint and attached thereto;
   (5) in any notice or process required or permitted by law or by
rule the condemnor,at its option, may combine in a single notice or
process, notice or process in as many separate civil actions as it may
choose in the in terests of economy and efficiency;
   (6) a district court shall adopt a local rule or general order that
the filing of a declaration of taking in the Master File constitutes
a filing of the same in each of the actions to which it relates;
   (7) a district court may adopt a local rule or order that, unless
otherwise ordered, all issues of just compensation involved in a
single declaration of taking shall be consolidated for a joint hear­
ing and trial.

              NOTICE COSTS IN CLASS ACTION CASES

   The Conference was advised that the Administrative Office had
referred to the committee the problem of payment of costs of
notices ordered by court.e in class action cases pursuant to Rule 23
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Conference agreed to
seven general recommendations, two of which concern recommen­
dations to the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules in connection
w'ith its comprehensive reevaluation of Rule 23. The Conference
agreed that the fiscal questions which precipitated the committee
inquiry are an integral part of larger judicial problems in the appli­
cation of Rule 23. The other recommendations approved provide:
   (1) that reimbursement to the Postal Service for the use of pen­
alty covers in sending out class action notices be accomplished
through payment into the respective clerk's deposit fund account
and reimbursements therefrom to the Administrative Office through
                                  41 

its suspense account for payment periodically to the Postal Service
as against accruing penalty cover charges;
   (2) that penalty covers for court use be ordered solely through
the Administrative Office; that the printing of penalty covers by
authorization of individual courts be discontinued; that all penalty
covers, including those for use of the courts, bear the statutory
penalty language; that if penalty covers are to be utilized for class
action purposes involving more than 500 for an individual notice
without prepayment or security for postage costs, it is required
that report of this fact, the quantity of mail to be involved, and any
provision for reimbursement be made in advance to the Adminis­
trative Office, and that the Administrative Office endeavor to de­
velop among the courts and with the Postal Service a more
satisfactory and accurate reporting and accounting system for pen­
alty mailings and in the Congress appropriations responsive to any
essential unreimbursed use by the courts of penalty coverage;
   (3) that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1914(b) the regular postage rates
for any penalty covers utilized under orders of court for the mail­
ing of class action notices shall be among the additional fees to be
collected by clerks of court;
   (4) that dIstrict courts be reminded that under subsection (c)
of the same statute they may require by rule or order the advance
payment of notice expenses; and
   (5) that class management problems and notice costs within the
availability of authorized funds, accounting regulation of the Ad­
ministrative Office, and any interim guidelines to be approved by
the Conference, shall be left to further development by the various
district and circuit courts on a case by case basis pending a compre­
hensive reexamination and reevaluation of Rule 23 by the Advisory
Committee on Civil Rules of Civil Procedure.

                     REVIEW COMMITTEE
  Judge Edward A. Tamm, Chairman, presented the report of the
Review Committee.
  Upon examination of the reports filed for the six-month period
ending June 80, 1972, Judge Tamm reported that fourteen circuit
and district judges did not file reports for that period. In accordance
                                        42 

with Conference resolution at its March 1971 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 24) Judge Tamm reported that these judges are:

 U.S. Circuit Judge 	                         U.S. District Judge

  *Judges heretofore declining to file "as a matter of principle."

   The Conference noted the expression by the Oommittee that care
should be exercised by all judges serving in either family or non­
family trusts or estates and with or without compensation that the
time consumed by these assignments does not interfere with the
performance of judicial duties. A similar observation was made as
to the small number of judges who serve as teacl1ers or who have
received income from lectures.
  The committee reiterated that whenever it is forced to make
further inquiry based on reports filed, such inquiry does not in any
way suggest that the Review Committee questions, approves or
disapproves the particular affiliation or other matter concerning
which inquiry is made.
  On recommendation of the committee the Conference approved
the resolution requiring that all full-time United States magistrates
and all full-time referees in bankruptcy be required to file with the
committee, with the chief judge of the circuit involved and the clerk
of the district court from which they operate a semiannual report
of extrajudicial income in the same form and at the same time as is
now required of federal judges.

    INTERIM ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL 

                  ACTIVITIES 

   Judge Elbert P. Tuttle presented the report of the Interim Ad­
visory Committee on Judicial Aotivities of which he is chairman.
   Judge Tuttle pointed out that two formal opinions of the com·
mittee have been rendered since the last session of the Conference
(Opinions Nos. 24 and 25) and that these have been circulated to
all federal judges.
   The Conference agreed that all full-time magistrates were subject
to the 1963 resolution of the Judicial Conference (Conf. Rept.,
p. 62) which provides that no justice or judge shall serve in the
capacity of an officer, director or employee of a corporation orga­
nized for profit.
               INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on Intercircuit Assignments covering the period from
February 15 to September 15, 1972.
  During the period in question the Committee recommended 53
assignments to be undertaken by 38 judges. Of this number one is a
circuit judge in aciive status, 11 are senior circuit judges, four are
district judges in active status and 16 are senior distriot judges. One
retired Supreme Court Justice, one active and two senior judges of
the Court of Claims and one aciive and one senior judge of the
Customs Court participated in 13 assignments.
  There were 25 ~ignments to the circuit courts of appeals during
this period. Fourteen senior circuit judges, three senior district
judges, one retired Supreme Court Justice and two senior judges of
the Court of Claims assisted in carrying out these sssignments.
There was one 8.S8ignment to the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals carried out by a retired Supreme Court Justice and 27
asSignments to the district courts, of which 17 were carried out by
14 senior district judges, one by a retired Supreme Court Justice
and three by a senior judge of the Customs Court.
  COMMITTEE ON COURT FACILITIES AND DESIGN
  The report of the Committee on Court Facilities and Design was
presented by the committee chairman, Ohief Judge Edward J.
Devitt.
                                   44 

     At the October 1971 session of the Conference it wa.s agreed that
  the committee should continue in existence to work further with
  General Services Administration on the design of auxiliary court­
  room facilities (ConI. Rept., p. 65). Judge Devitt advised that the
  committee had proceeded on the basis of this mandate and now
  recommended to the Conference (1) that each judge be allocated
  up to 1,600 square feet of space for himself, secretary and law clerks,
  to be allocated to chambers, library, office or conference room a.s hiB
  individual needs may require, and (2) tha~t each courtroom be allo­
  cated up to 1,300 square feet of space for adjunct facilities, includ­
 ing approximately 330 square feet for a jury deliberation room,
  approximately 125 square feet for a holding cell for defendants in
  custody and approximately 200 square feet as a witnEm room; and
 that the remaining approximately 645 square feet be allocated in
 the discretion of the judge as the needs of the district may require
 for conference or robing room, attorneys' conference room, minute
 clerk's office, court reporters' room, exhibit and storage area or for
 other court use.
    Judge Devitt advised that the General Services Administration
 had prepared charts available to all judges in the planning of
 facilities for new court construction and urged that the judges give
 careful consideration to the suggested functional arrangements of
 these facilities whiuh, in the opinion of General Services Adminis­
 tration, represent the best possible interarrangement of activity
 areas for traffic flow, communication, convenience, privacy and se­
curity. The latest security proposals being developed by the Office
of the United States Marshals will be embodied in this construction.
    The Conference noted that both of these recommendations are
substantially larger than the minimum dimensions adopted in 1949
and, after discussion, voted its approval of both the recommenda­
tions.
    Judge Devitt reiterated the support of his committee for the
recommendation made in October 1971 that a standard courtroom
in the size of 28 x 40 feet was most practical, based on lack of need
for large audience space, development of air conditioning, adapta­
bility when new judges are appointed and in conformance with the
national trend in the state courts. The committee also presented for
Conference consideration an intermediate size courtroom of 34 x 44
feet with a 12 foot ceiling. Mter discussing these proposals relating
to new courthouse construction, the Conference
                                        45 

   Re80lved, that it is the sense of the Conference that courtrooms in courthouses
hereafter constructed for United States district courts should range from 1,120
square feet, 28' x 40', to 1,496 square feet, 84' x 44', and that in the planning of
future construction the judicial councils of the circuits shall tI.x the number of
each such courtroom after consultation with the district judges. Where need Is
demonstrated on the basis of projected caseloads, one or more large courtrooms
of 2,400 square feet, 40' x 60', for unusual purposes, such as multiparty cases, In­
cluding, where needed, one ceremonial courtroom.
  It was further resolved to be the sense of the Judicial Conference that, in
adapting present space to courtroom use, General Services Administration should
apply practical standards on a case by case basis.
  On the adoption of these resolutions, Judge Devitt moved that
his ad hoc committee be relieved and dismissed. The Conference,
however, was of the view that the committee should be retained in
existence to handle such special problems relating to courtroom
space as may arise from time to time.
          RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
 Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
                                 CmL RULES

   Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules
was giving extended consideration to Rule 23 relating to class ac­
tions and had directed its reporter to prepare alternative drafts of
possible amendments to that rule for consideration at its next
meeting.
                             APPELLATE         RULES
    The Conference was advised that the committee had deferred
submitting to the Conference proposed amendments to Appellate
Rules 9(d) and lO(b) which had been submitted to the committee
at the suggestion of the Conference Committee on the Adminis­
 tration of the Criminal Law. The suggestion was, in substance, to
deny release on bail pending appeal to a defendant who has not
made satisfactory arrangements with the court reporter for pro~
curing a transcript of the testimony and who has not been granted
leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The suggestion, further, was that
such fa.ilure should also be grounds for dismissal of the appeaL
   Judge Maris stated that his committee thought that the prob­
lema involved. other aspects of appellate procedure and should be
considered along with many other ways in which the courts of
                                46 


appeals are now seeking to meet the problem of delay by the Ad­
visory Committee on Appellate Rules when it is reconstituted.
Accordingly, no recommendation was made for action by the Con­
ference on these two proposed amendments at this time.

                       BANKRUPTCY RULES

   The Conference approved for transmittal to the Supreme Court
 proposed rules and official forms under Chapters I-VII of the
 Bankruptcy Act (ordinary bankruptcy) and under Chapter XIII
 of the Bankruptcy Act. The Conference also approved the commit­
tee recommendation that if the Supreme Court adopt.s these rules,
it would be proposed that they take effect on July 1, 1973.
   In submitting the bankruptcy rules, Judge Maris pointed out
that ever since full rule-making authority under the Bankruptcy
Act was conferred upon the Supeme Court by Congress in 1964, the
Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules has been engaged in the
large task of preparing a comprehensive study of rules and official
forms not only for Chapters I-VII and Chapter XIII but also under
Section 77 relating to railroad reorganization, Chapter IX, local
taxing agency compositions, Chapter X, corporate reorganizations,
Chapter XI, arrangements and Chapter XII, non-corporate real
property arrangements. Judge Maris said that preliminary drafts
of rules under Chapters X and XI will be published to the bench
and bar shortly and draft.s of rules under the remaining chapters
are in preparation.
   It was further pointed out to the Conference that the statutory
Oommission on the Bankruptcy Laws is devoting itself solely to the
substantive aspects of the law upon the theory that the proposed
bankruptcy and Chapter XIII rules now approved for transmission
to the Supreme Court will fully cover the procedural aspects.
                        CRIMINAL RULES

  The Conference approved for transmittal to the Supreme Court
proposed amendments to criminal rules 4(a), 9(a), 11, 12, 15, 16,
17(f), 20, 32(a), 32(0), 32(e), 43 and 50 and proposed new criminal
rules 12.1, 12.2 and 29.1.
  The Conference was advi&ed that the sta.nding Committee did
not recommend approval at this time of the proposed new criminal
rule 41.1 with respect to non-testimonial identification before and
after arrest. This proposal which has been circulated to the bench
                                 47 

and bar has evoked a number of serious questions which require
further study and the committee believes that before a procedural
rule on this subject is recommended to the Supreme Court, the
committees and the Conference should have the benefit of more ex­
perience with such procedure in the states and in the District of Co­
lumbia and of judicial consideration of the Constitutional questions
involved. The committee was further of the view that such a proce­
dure is one with which the federal courts would have little occasion
to deal except in the District of Columbia where the crimes of vio­
lence involved are, under recent reorganization, tried in the local
Superior Court rather than in the United States District Court. The
committee was of the view that the Superior Court could establish
procedures under its own rule-making authority, thus meeting the
need in the District of Columbia.

CORRELATION WITH SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAWS AND
                            PROCEDURES

   The Conference authorized the standing Committee and advisory
committees to cooperate with the Senate Subcommittee on Crimi­
nal Laws and Procedures now engaged in preparation of a revision
of Title 18, United States Code, for the general purpose of imple­
menting the recommendations of the National Commission on
Reform of the Federal Criminal Laws. The Senate subcommittee,
recognizing that Title 18 at present includes a large number of
procedural provisions which are not included in the federal rules of
criminal procedure, desires that such of these provisions as are not
obsolete, as well as any new procedures which may be required to
implement any changes proposed in the substantive law, be incor­
porated into the federal rules and thus subject directly to the rule­
making authority of the Supreme Court. In order to synchronize
this process, the subcommittee proposed that its draft bill include
two titles-Title I, the Revised Federal Criminal Code of Substan­
tive Law, and Title II, the Proposed Amendments and Additions
to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, including those amend­
ments transferring the useful procedural provisions of Title 18.
Although these rules amendments would be accomplished by
statute, it is proposed to make it clear that their enactment in this
way will not derogate from the rule-making power of the Supreme
Court or affect its authority to deal with all the rules, including
these amendments by way of further amendment or modification.

                      ApPROPRIATION PROVISO

   The Conference was advised that from the inception of the rules
study program the funds to carryon the program have come from
the funds appropriated to the Administrative Office and for travel
of judges and referees, subject to the express proviso th3it "not to
exceed $90,000 of the appropriation contained in this title shall be
available for the study of rules of practice and procedure." There
has been no increase in this limitation over the twelve years of the
program despite the tremendous increase in costs of all kinds. Yet,
the Conference was in agreement that the program has been carried
out with distinguished results. There have, however, been great
hardships resulting from in:ability to schedule committee meetings
for lack of available travel money, inadequate compensation of
reporters and frequent delays in publish.ing preliminary drafts. The
Conference agreed that the public value of the rules program has
been amply demonstrated and instructed the Budget Committee to
request Congress to delete the limiting proviSO from future judici­
ary appropriations.

   COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURy 

                  SYSTEM 

  The report of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury Sys­
tem was presented by the Chairman, Judge Irving R. Kaufman.

             AUTOMATION OF JURY SELECTION PROCESS

   The Conference, noting that nine districts at the present time
use automated jury selection techniques for the purpose of selecting
juror names from voter lists to create master jury wheels, as well
as to select qualified jurors from the master wheels and to address
juror questionnaires, summonses and vouchers, approved a policy
statement that (1) when the General Services Administration does
not have facilities to aid district courts in automating juror selec­
tion, private computer firms should be favored if funds are avail­
able, and (2) the requirement of supervision by a court clerk or
commissioner be maintained pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1866.
                                 49
                        JUROR UTILIZATION

  The Conference approved for immediate distribution a report
prepared by the Federal Judicial Center entitled "Guidelines for
Improving Juror Utilization in the United States District Courts."

                        JURY WORKSHOPS

   The Conference agreed that each district should be encouraged to
have jury workshops and in so doing to utilize the staffs of the Ad­
ministrative Office and the Federal Judicial Center. The Confer­
ence agreed that those districts which appear in the 1972 annual
report of the Director of the Administrative Office as having a rec­
ord lower than the national median for jury usage be encouraged
to hold conferences or workshops for improving juror uitlization
for all district courts, preferably at a time not coinciding with the
circuit conference. The Conference also agreed that districts within
a circuit having similar problems might have joint conferences.

                   STUDY OF THE GRAND JURY

   The Conference was advised that a communication had been re­
ceived from the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House
of Representatives suggesting that a study be undertaken under the
auspices of the Conference of the operation of the grand jury in the
federal court system. The Conference authorized the Chief Justice
to refer this matter to the appropriate committee or committees of
the Conference for consideration.

  COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
              CRIMINAL LAW
  Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli, Chairman, presented the committee's
report to the Conference.

                   CruMINAL ARREST RECORDS

  The Conference considered on reference from the Congress H.R.
13315, a bill which would amend Title 28 of the United States
Code to provide for limited dissemination and use of criminal arrest
                                 50 

records in a manner that assures their security and privacy. The
Conference agreed that if such legislation is enacted it should be
so amended as to require recourse to and exhaustion of appropriate
administrative procedures before relief may be sought in a United
States district court. The Conference agreed, however, that a de­
termination as to whether such legislation should be enacted is a
matter involving a legislative policy to be determined by the
Congress.

         NULLIFICATION OF CERTAIN CRIMINAL RECORDS

   The Conference next considered S. 2732, providing for the nulli­
fication of certain criminal records. The Conference adopted the
views of the committee that while it did not disagree with the soci­
ological objectives of the proposed legislation, nevertheless, it dis­
approved the bill because the standards provided are vague, the
procedures are cumbersome and unworkable and would render in­
terminable the processing of many criminal cases.

         PRETRIAL DETENTION IN METROPOLITAN AREAS

   Because the detention of persons accused of federal crimes and
awaiting trial in many metropolitan districts presents serious hous­
ing, security, travel and other detention problems that are rapidly
becoming acute, the Conference agreed to a committee-sponsored
resolution urging the Bureau of Prisons to provide adequate feder­
ally operated detention centers in all metropolitan areas.

        USE OF FIREARMS To COMMIT CERTAIN FELONIES

  The Conference disapproved H.R. 13788 which would make the
use of a fireann to commit certain felonies a federal crime where
such use violates state law. The Conference was in agreement that
such legislation would constitute an unnecessary and excessive ex­
pansion of federal jurisdiction and furthennore would provide for
substantial mandatory sentences, a practice which the Conference
has consistently disapproved.
FEDERAL GRANTS To PROMOTE PROMPT TRIAL IN STATE COURTS

  The Conference considered, at the request of the Congress, S.
3669, a bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
                                         51 

Act of 1968, to require the prompt trial of defendants in criminal
cases and to provide grants to state and local governments for im­
proving the administration of criminal justice. Inasmuch as this
legislation affects only state and local prosecutions and involves
funding considerations by the Congress, the Conference agreed that
it should take no position on the legislation.

                     EXPUNGING CRIMINAL RECORDS

   The Controlled Dangerous Substances Act (Public Law 91-513)
provides for the expunging of criminal records of certain first of­
fenders under age twenty-one charged only with possession of a
controlled dangerous subst.ance and placed on probation. In order
that the clerks of court may adopt a uniform procedure in carry­
ing out the provisions of Section 404 of this Act, the Conference at,
its meeting in March 1971 (Conf. Rept., p. 5), directed that the
clerks of court should be instructed as follows:
   Pursuant to an order under this section, the clerk shall first obliterate the name
of the individual from all indexes, and shall withdraw the docket sheets and the
file containing the papers of the case from the court records. He then shall notify
the Administrative Office, the court reporter, the probation officer and the magis­
trate of the order instructing them to make a similar obliteration and withdrawal
of the papers in the case and delivery of the papers to the clerk.
   All the papers shall thereupon be expunged by being placed in the sealed records
of the court to be opened only upon court order, and shall be physically destroyed
after 10 years.
   Judge Zirpoli advised that subsequently the Administrative
Office brought to the attention of the Committee the regulations
adopted by the Department of Justice to implement the procedures
for expunging of criminal records under said Section 404 of the Con­
trolled Dangerous Substances Act. These regulations would require
the clerks of the United States district courts to turn over to the
United. States Attorney all of the official court reoords, including
records of the probation officer, Administrative Office and United
States magistrate. These regulations conflict with the above quoted
instructions to the clerks adopted by the Judicial Conference. Fol­
lowing discussion of the matter, the Chnference agreed. with the
committee reoommendation to adhere to its' previous position in
respect to all papers constituting official court records.

COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 

                                      ACT 

  The report of the committee was presented by the Chairman,
Judge ROBzel C. Thomsen.

                     ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   Judge Thomsen presented to the Conference the report of the
Director of the Administrative Office for the six-month period end­
ing June 30, 1972, which reflected that during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1972, there were approximately 50,000 persons represented
under the Criminal Justice Act. Approximately 14 percent of these
were assigned to defender organiz8JtJions. A total of $14,500,000 was
appropriated for activities under the Criminal Justice Act during
the fiscal year. The cost of operating the eight public defender
offices approximated $1,300,000. These offices were assigned 'a total
of 5,614 cases and disposed of 4,243. GTants to the community
defender organiz8Jtions aggregated $672,040, including an initial
grant to the Federal Defenders of San Diego and sustaining grants
to the defender organizations in Ohicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and
New York. The Conference authorized the Director of the Admin­
istrative Office to transmit the semiannual statistical report to all
federal judges and the judges of the courts of the District of
Columbia.
                                 GUIDELINES

   Noting the decision of the Supreme Court in Argersinger v. Ham­
lin (407 U.S. 25), which, in effect, requires the assignment of coun­
sel in any petty offense case in which the defendant faces loss of
liberty, the Conference authorized the following guideline:
               PETTY OFFENSE CASES INVOLVING      Loss   OF LIBERTY

  Although the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 provides for representation of a
person "charged with a felony or misdemeanor (other than a petty offense as
defined in section 1 of this title)", the Act as amended in 1970 also provides for
representation of a person "for whom the Sixth Amendment to the (JQnstitution
requires the appointment of counsel, or for whom, in a case in which he faces loss
of Uberty, any Federal law requires the appointment of counsel." In accordance
with the decision in Arger8inger v. Hamlin, decided June 12, 1972,407 U.S. 25,
counsel may be assigned in a petty offense case if, in the opinion Gf the judge or
magistrate, the defendant faces the likelihood Gf a prison sentence if convicted.
There are many petty offenses in which a prison sentence is rarely imposed.
                                        53 

    Judges and magistrates should exercise discretion in assigning counsel in petty
  offense cases, in view of the potential budgetary implications as well as the im­
 pact on the private bar; on the other hand, the Supreme Court has held that
 "absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any
 offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he was repre­
 sented by counsel at his trial." It Is suggested that each court develop a form of
 waiver for use when appropriate.
    Whenever a plan prepared pursuant to the Act does not incorporate the phrase
 "in a case where the defendant faces loss of liberty," or substantially similar
 language, as used in the revised Act, plans should be amended to include such
 language in accordance with Argersinuer v. Hamlin.
    Where appointments are made in such cases, the same limits of compensation
 shall be applicable as in misdemeanor cases.
  Some public defender offices have requested guidance in the dis­
position of public records. On recommendation of the committee,
the Conference approved the following guideline:
              FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS-DISPOSITION OF RECORDS

   The Federal Public Defender may transfer to the Federal Records Center the
records of cases that have been closed for more than two years. Case records so
transferred to the Federal Records Center may be marked for destruction at the
end of fifteen years except in those instances in which the Federal Public De­
fender may indicate that the records should be held for a longer period of time.

             USE OF LAW STUDENTS AND LEGAL INTERNS

   Judge Thomsen advised the Conference that in some circuits
arrangements have been made for the use of qualified law students
to assist assigned counsel in the preparation of briefs and arguments
on appeal. The Criminal Justice Act permits payments only to
members of the bar but he advised that the committee saw no
reason why, if a given court is satisfied with aITangements made
with law schools for auxiliary services, such as qualified law stu­
dents, such a plan could not be operated. Payment in such instances
would be to the members of the faculty who were assigned as coun­
sel and only for compensable time spent by the faculty members,
plus allowable expenses. The committee reiterated that the pri­
mary purpose of special arrangements must always be to improve
the service rendered to a defendant by counsel.

                             ANNUAL REPORTS

 The Conference noted that pursuant to the statutory require­
ment all federal public defender organizations have submitted to
                                  54 


the Director of the Administrative Office reports of their activities
and financial position and a proposed budget. The community de­
fender organizations have likewise submitted annual reports, set­
ting forth their. activities, financial positions and anticipated case­
loads and expenses for the forthcoming year.
          CONTINUED ApPOINTMENT OF SAME COUNSEL

   At the April 1972 session (Conf. Rept., p. 21) the Conference
resolved that the Administrative Office should determine on a
quarterly basis the names of any attorneys appointed under the Act
during that quarter who were paid more than $1,000. Since the Ad­
ministrative Office is geared to semiannual reporting and in view
of the new maximum payments authorized by the amendments to
the Criminal Justice Act, the Conference agreed to a modification
of the action taken at the April session and resolved to require the
Director of the Administrative Office to report on a semiannual
basis to the chief judges of both the circuit and district courts in­
volved the names of any attorneys who during the preceding six­
month period have received more than $6,000 as payment for serv­
ices rendered pursuant to appointment under the Criminal Justice
Act.
                     COLLATERAL PROCEEDINGS

  Judge Thomsen advised that the committee had considered two
requests relating to collateral proceedings. The first related to a
number of "in-service" habeas corpus cases arising under 28 U.S.C.
2241 (c) (1). He said that the committee had advised that such
proceedings are not regarded as collateral to criminal proceedings
and, therefore, are not covered by the provisions of subsection (g)
of the Criminal Justice Act, as amended. The second question re­
lated to ancillary matters, such as appeals of bail matters under
28 U.S.C. 3147 (b), petitions of writs of mandamus in connection
with pending criminal matters, appeals by the government for
orders granting motions to suppress and appeals from dismissals
of indictments. Judge Thomsen stated that the committee had
advised that all of these matters are within the purview of the
Criminal Justice Act, although for reporting purposes they are not
new cases.

                             ApPROVAL OF GRANTS

  The Conference was advised that for fiscal year 1973 sustaining
grants have been approved as follows:
Federal Defender Program, Inc., Chicago, Ill_______________________        $159,000
Legal Aid and Defender Association of Detroit, Mich________________         121, 333
Defender Association of Phlladelphia______________________________          155,000
Federal Defender Services Unit of the Legal Aid Society of New York__       672, 000

   In addition, an initial grant in the amount of $1,495 and a 8US~
taining grant in the amount of $29,960 was approved for the Com­
munity Defender Organization of Minnesota. Supplemental grants
were subsequently approved for the Federal Defender Program,
Inc., for the Northern District of Illinois in the sum of $24,000 on
an annual basis and for the Federal Defender Office of Detroit in
the sum of $50,000 on an annual basis.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
             BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM
  The report of the Committee on Bankruptcy Administration
was presented by the Chairman, Judge Edward Weinfeld.

            SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

   The Conference was advised that the committee had considered
recommendations contained in the survey report of the Director
of the Administrative Office, dated June 21, 1972, as well as the
recommendations of the circuit councils and district judges con­
cerned, for the authorization for continuation of new six-year
terms for nine referee positions to become vacant by expiration of
term and for changes in arrangements for four referee positions.
  The Conference approved the following recommendations for
continuation of terms of office for referees and recommendations
for changes in arrangements, all to be effective November 1, 1972,
unless otherwise indicated and subject to the availability of funds.
                                SECOND CIROUIT

                                 LEGISLATION

   The Conference noted that two laws affecting bankruptcy admin­
istration were enacted by the 92nd Congress-Public Law 92-251,
extending the term of the Commission to Study the Bankruptcy
Laws of the United States, and Public Law 92-310, eliminating the
requirement that referees are to be bonded.
   Several bills recommended by the Conference were approved by
the Senate but did not reach action in the House of Representa­
tives. One such bill, S. 1394, would eliminate from Section 40(b) of
the Bankruptcy Act the proviso that no salary fixed under the pro­
visions of the section for a full-time referee shall be changed more
often than once in any two years or in an amount of less than $250.
The Conference voted to reaffirm its support of this legislation.

                          CHAPTER      XIII    CASES

   In response to a request as to whether a common form of st/anding
Chapter XIII Trustee's bond carrying a limitation of $500 per case
complied with the Judicial Conference guideline requiring a
Trustee's bond of one and one-half times the trustee's average
monthly balance, the Conference was advised that the committee
was in agreement that bonds with a case limitation of $500 were not
in conflict with the prior Conference action.

                        SEMINARS FOR REFEREES

  The Oonference noted that the Eighth National Seminar for
newly appointed referees in bllJlkruptcy was held at the Federal
Judicial Center during the week of October 2, 1972. A regional sem­
inar was also held at Newport Beach, California, and three addi­
                                       58 

tional seminars were scheduled for calendar year 1972 at San
Francisco, South Bend and New York City.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

            MAGISTRATES SYSTEM 

  Judge Charles M. Metzner, Chairman of the Committee on the
Administration of the Magistrates System, presented the report of
the committee.
                                 SALARY INCREASES

   Judge Metzner informed the Conference that on September 21,
1972, the President signed into law the bill increasing the statutory
ceilings on salaries of full-time United States magistrates from
$22,500 per annum to three-fourths of the salary of a United States
district judge, or $30,000 per annum, and increasing the ceiling on
the salaries of part-time United States magistrates from $11,000
per annum to $15,000 per annum. Thereafter, as recommended by
the Magistrates Committee, the Executive Committee of the Con­
ference on September 29 approved increases in the salaries of all
full-time magistrate positions authorized at this present time from
$22,500 per annum to $30,000, except that the salocy of the full­
time United States magistrate at Yosemite National Park was in­
creased from $14,000 to $16,000 per annum; and approved salary
increases for all part-time magistrates now receiving $11,000 per
annum from $11,000 to $12,000 per annum. These poct-time magis­
trates did not receive the 5.5 percent salary increase authorized
generally for part-time magistrates at the April 1972 session of the
Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 14). A supplemental appropriation
was subsequently obtained which will make it possible to put these
salary increases into effect on December 1, 1972.
   The salary increases approved by the Executive Committee are
as follows:                                                                         '

  *These positions were authorized as full-time at salaries of $22,500 per annum
at the April 1972 session (COnf. Rept., p. 15) lIubject to availability of funds.
The salaries for full-time status were also increased to $30,000 per annum, subject
to the availability of funds.

  The Conference expressed agreement with the action taken by
the Executive Committee and further ratified Executive Committee
action designating the magistrates at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as
magistrates for the new Middle District of Louisiana rather than
the Eastern District.

                             MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

   The Committee reported that it had considered various requests
fOT' the creation of additional magistrate positions, changes in sal­
aries of magistrates, and changes in arrangements. These requests
have also been considered by the judicial councils of the circuits.
In accordance with the recommendations of the committee, the
Conference approved the following changes in the numbers, loca­
tions, arrangements, and salaries of magistrates and directed that,
unless otherwise noted, these changes be made effective at such time
as appropriated funds are available.

                          CoNFLICTS OF INTERESTS

   Judge Metzner reported that during the hearings on the bill to
increase the statutory limitations on salaries of full-time and part­
time magistrates, the Judiciary Committees of the Congress made
inquiry regarding potential conflicts of interest of part-time magis­
trates. While no instance of a conflict of interest was reported,
nevertheless, concern was expressed about the possibility that part­
time judicial officers might use their official positions or titles in a
way that could be construed as advancing private business interests
                                          68 

and private law practices. Speeific mention was made of a practice
followed by a few part-time magistrates of including the title of
United States Magistrate on general office letterhead.
   In order that there be a standard rule against practices such as
this, the committee recommended, and the Conference approved,
the following conflict-of-interest rule to be added to the list of the
seven rules previously approved by the Conference:
  A part-time magistrate may not use his official position in any way to promote
his prIvate law practice. In this regard he may not use his official stationery in
the conduct of his law practice nor include his official title on general office letter­
head.
                       ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

  The Conference, upon recommendation of the committee, ap­
proved a change in the regulations of the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office to permit part-time United States magistrates to
requisition official stationery in the same manner that official forms
are requisitioned.
                       TRANSCRIPTS OF PROCEEDINGS

   Inquiry had been received by the Administrative Office concern­
ing the availability of funds to pay for the preparation of tran­
scripts of proceedings held before United States magistrates serv­
ing under appointment as special masters under Rule 53, Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, where petitioners were indigent. The
costs of preparing transcripts of proceedings before special masters
have traditionally been charged against the parties as an expense
of litigation. There is no provision in law authorizing the govern­
ment to pay these costs.
   Upon recommendation of the committee, the Conference author­
izedthe Director of the Administrative Office to prepare and trans­
mit to the Congress appropriate amendments to the Judicial Code
to permit payment of transcript costs on behalf of indigent litigants
in these situations.

    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  Judge Francis L. Van Dusen, Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee on the Administration of the Probation System.
                                  69
                            LEGISLATION

   The Conference was advised that its views had been requested
by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives
on H.R. 13293, a bill designed to promote more effective operations
and management of the federal corrections system by reorganizing
certain functions and creating new organizations. After a study of
this proposed bill, the Conference agreed with the recommendation
of the committee that it disapprove Titles II and III of H.R. 13293
because of the drastic changes they would effect in sentencing pro­
cedures now followed by the federal judiciary, including delays in
sentencing and in disposition of criminal cases. The Conference was
further of the view that Title I should be implemented by broad­
ening the membership of the Advisory Corrections Council pro­
vided for in 18 U.S.C. 5002. This is a reaffirmation of the position
taken by the Conference at its October 1971 meeting (Conf. Rept.,
p.47).
   Judge Van Dusen advised the Conference of other legislative pro­
posals under study by the committee which will be the subject of
later report to the Conference. Specifically, the Conference ap­
proved a draft bill to provide for setting aside of conviction of adult
probationers and directed the Administrative Office to submit the
proposal to the 93rd Congre!S.

                     SENTENCING INSTITUTES

   The Conference was advised that the First and Second Circuits
Sentencing Institute, the agenda for which was approved at the
April 1972 session (Conf. Rept., p. 12), will take place on Janu­
ary 11-13, 1973 at Crotonville, New York. The Conference was
advised that plans are moving forward for the Joint Sentencing
Institute for the Eighth and Tenth Circuits approved by the Con­
ference at its April 1972 session (Conf. Rept., pp. 12, 13'). The Con­
ference also noted that plans are in the discussion stage for a Joint
Fourth and Fifth Circuits Sentencing Institute to be held in the
fall of 1974.
                          RESOLUTIONS
  The Conference noted the retirement at the end of the 92nd Con­
gress of three members whose C3ifeers have been closely associated
with the work of the Judicial Conference and the federal judiciary
                                         70 

and, accordingly, approved the following resolutions to be trans­
mitted to each member by the Chief Justice:
                        THE HONORABLE EMANUEL CELLER
   The Judicial Conference of the United States, assembled at its annual 1972 fall
session, takes note of the retirement at the close of the 92nd Congress of Honor­
able Emanuel Celler as a Representative from the State of New York in the
House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
   Mr. Celler's Congressional service spanned half a century, 1923-1972,-a record
onlY once exceeded. In the last twenty-four years he has served as the distin­
guished Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representar
tives, a position to which he brought prodigious energy and talent.
   During his long career he has sponsored more amendments to the United States
Constitution than any person in the history of the nation. He has authored im­
portant legislation in the fields of antitrust law and immigration law and has
been a frequent sponsor of Judicial Conference-approved legisiation, particularly
those measures which were designed to improve the administration of justice
throughout the federal judicial system.
   Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, That the Judicial Conference of the United
States express to Congressman Emanuel Celler its sincere appreciation for his
loyalty, friendship and interest in the federal judiciary and extend to him its best
wishes for many active years of retirement.

                    THE HONORABLE WILLIAM M. MOCULLOOH
   Be It Resolved by the Judicial Conference of the United States, assembled at
its semi-annual session on October 27, 1972, that notice be taken of the valuable
contribution of Representative William M. McCulloch of Ohio to the Federal
Judicial Branch as an outstanding member of the House Judiciary Committee
and as a congressman since 1947, ranking minority leader of the Honse Judiciary
Committee since 1959, and as a warm friend of the federal judges of this nation.
   The Conference takes special note of the many innovations in the federal law
that have been crafted by this dedicated congressman in his two and one-half
decades of devoted service, of his legislative efforts on behalf of minorities, of his
assistance to the President in studying the causes of civil disorder and violence,
of his success in supporting and strengthening the manpower and procedures of
the federal judiciary, and of his unfiagging interest in helping the courts attain
their goal of effective, fair and efficient administration of justice. The Conference
recogn1!lles that his presence as a real friend of the courts will be sorely missed
after his impending retirement from the House of Representatives.
   The Conference further resolves that sincere appreciation is expressed to Con­
gressman McCulloch for his contribution to the federal judiciary and for his
friendship, loyalty and interest and that best wishes are extended to him f()r
many active years of good health and happiness in his well-earned retirement.

                         THE HONORABLE FRANK T. Bow
  Be It Resolved by the Judicial Conference of the United States that notice be
taken of the valuable contribution to the federal judiciary of Representative
Frank T . .Bow, who came to the House of Representatives in 1950, became a mem­
                                      71 

ber of the House Appropriations Committee in 1953 and has since served with
great distinction as the ranking minority member, both of the full Committee on
Appropriations and its Subcommittee on State, Justice, Commerce and the Judi­
ciary, as we'll as in other committee assignments.
  The Conference notes that Representative Bow has wOl'ked tirelessly and
enthusiastically to strengthen the federal judiciary; he has devoted his time to
finding out its needs and problems and has given his wise counsel to the task of
providing revenues to support the judicial machinery over the last two decades.
His presence as a friend of the courts will be missed.
   The Conference further resolves that due notice of its great appreciation for
his contribution to the federal judiciary and his &<>vernment be conveyed to
Representative Bow by the Chief Justice of the United States.
