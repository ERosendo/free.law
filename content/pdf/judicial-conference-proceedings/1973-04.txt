   Senior Circuit Judges Albert B. Maris, Elbert P. Tuttle; Circuit
Judges Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Ruggero J. Aldisert, Irving R.
Kaufman, Edward A. Tamm; Senior District Judges Roy W. Har­
per, Roszel C. Thomsen, Carl A. Weinman; and District Judges
Charles M. Metzner, Edward Weinfeld, Albert C. Wollenberg and
Alfonso J. Zirpoli attended all or some of the sessions of the Con­
ference.
   The Honorable Erwin N. Griswold, Solicitor General of the
United States, addressed the Conference at the opening of the first
seSSIOn.
   Noting that Solicitor General Griswold would complete his term
of office with the expiration of the present term of the Supreme
Court of the United States, the Conference, on motion of Chief
Judge Henry J. Friendly, adopted the following resolution:
  'l'he Judical Conference of the United States takes note of the retirement of
Erwin N. Griswold as Solicitor General of the United States, effective at the
close of the current Term of the Supreme Court.
  Solicitor General Griswold was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson
in 1967 and has served as Solicitor General for longer than all but two of his
predecessors. He brought to his work of representing the interests of the United
States before the Supreme Court and in the appellate courts a rich background
of experience and scholarship. Mr. Griswold previously served as Assistant to
the Solicitor General, 1929-1934, and was a Professor of Law at the Harvard
Law School and, thereafter, distinguished himself as Dean of the Harvard Law
School for more than twenty years.
  In his service to his country as Solicitor General, Mr. Griswold was noted for
the brilliance of his legal reasoning, the skillfulness of his arguments, the
thoroughness of his legal research, and his fidelity to his office. His contribution
to the administration of justice will not be easily matched.
  The Conference, therefore, takes this occasion to extend its best wishes to him
and Mrs. Griswold with the hope of many future years of happiness.
   The Honorable Alfred P. Murrah, Director of the Federal Judi­
cial Center and Chairman of the Panel on Multidistrict Litigation,
reported on the activities of the Center and of the Panel and pre­
sented a detailed written report to the Conference on the work of
the Panel.
   Mr. Mark Cannon, Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice,
Mr. Rowland F. Kirks, Director of the Administrative Office of
the United States Courts, and Mr. William E. Foley, Deputy Di­
rector, attended all of the sessions of the Conference.
                                 ELECTIONS
  Upon nomination of the Executive Committee, the Judicial Con­
ference approved for membership on the Board of the Federal
                                  3

Judicial Center Judge Griffin B. Bell of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Judge Bell succeeds Judge Wade H.
McCree, Jr., whose full four-year term as a member of the Board
expired at the end of March 1973.
  Upon nomination of the Executive Committee, the Judicial
Conference approved the nomihation of Chief Judge Howard T.
Markey of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as a member
of the Board of Certification to fill the term of Judge Roger Robb
whose resignation became effective March 14, 1973 and for a new
three-year term, beginning July 1,1973.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVF~
    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   The Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Kirks, in ad~
dressing the Conference pointed out that during the first half of
fiscal year 1973 the total civil and criminal litigation in the United
States districts courts was down from the level of the same period
in the prior fiscal year. Sixty-seven thousand, five hundred and
thirty-five actions were filed in the six-month period ending Decem­
ber 31, 1972 as compared to 70,067 at the mid-point of fiscal year
1972. This drop of, 3.5 percent is attributable to the fall-off in
criminal matters because civil filings increased 1.6 percent over
the prior year. This drop in criminal business partially reflects the
impact of the United States magistrates on the work of the
judiciary.
   Filings in the courts of appeals increased six percent in the first
six months of fiscal year 1973 over the same period in fiscal year
1972, whereas terminations in these courts increased nine percent
over the same period in the prior year.
   In the area of bankruptcy, the 85,000 cases filed in the first six
months of fiscal year 1973 are seven percent less than last year.
The 88,000 bankruptcy terminations are thr'ee percent less than the
prIor year.
   The workload 'of the probation system continues to increase. At
the end of January 1973 there were 51,528 persons under supervi­
sion of the federal probation system, an increase of over 2,500
offenders in less than seven months. In the first half of the fiscal
year probation officers completed 13,791 presentence investigations
as compared with 12,118 over the same period in the prior year.
                                  4


   Mr. Kirks also reported to the Conference on the success of the
court visitation program instituted in 1972 by the Administrative
Office and he reported to the Conference on the status of legisla­
tion of interest to the judiciary.

                  COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration, Judge
Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., presented the committee's report.

              CHANGE OF NAME FOR SUBCOMMITTEE

   In order more adequately to describe the duties and responsi­
bilities being exercised by the Subcommittee on Judicial Salaries.
Annuities and Tenure the Conference agreed with the recom­
mendation that the name of the subcommittee be changed to Sub­
committee on Judicial Improvements.

              ACCOMMODATIONS FOR CIRCUIT JUDGES

   The Conference approved S. 1175, a bill which would amend
Section 142 of Title 28, United States Code, to permit the Adminis­
trator of General Services, on request of the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Office of the United States Courts, to provide accom­
modations for judges of the United States courts of appeals at
places other than those where regular terms are authorized by law
to be held, if such accommodations have been approved as neces­
sary by the judicial council of the appropriate circuit and if space
is available without additional cost to the government. The Con­
ference noted that in two recent instances a newly appointed circuit
judge has requested that chambers be made available to him in a
federal building in the city of his residence and been refused because
that city had not been designated as a regular place of holding
court. Special legislation was required in one instance to accom­
plish this purpose. In the other instance, the judge has been forced
to ren t quarters at his own expense.

                FILING FEES IN FEDERAL COURTS

  The Committee on Court Administration has under study the
fees of the offices of the clerks of the courts of appeals and of the
district courts which have not been modified or increased since 1945.
At the present time the Judicial Conference has authorization to
                                      5

fix filing fees in the courts of appeals whereas filing fees in civil
actions in the district courts, in admiralty proceedings and in pro­
ceedings in bankruptcy are controlled by statute. The Conference
approved in principle legislation which would place the fixing of
fees in all proceedings in the courts of the United States under the
control of the Judicial Conference in an effort to permit frequent
review and greater flexibility. The Director of the Administrative
Office was requested to prepare appropriate legislation to carry out
this recommendation and to transmit it to the Congress.

                  JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT

  The Conference reaffirmed its support of a bill originally intro­
duced in 1969 in the Senate as S. 1511, the effect of which was to
merge the Judicial Survivors Annuity Fund with the Civil Service
Fund. The Conference agreed that such legislation was of the ut­
most importance in view of the fact that the Judicial Survivors
Annuity Fund will be exhausted in a limited period of years.

                     COURT OF ApPEALS OPINIONS

    At its October 1972 session (Conf. Rept., p. 33) the Judicial Con­
 ference requested each circuit to develop an opinion publication
  plan by January 1, 1973 which was to be submitted to the Com­
  mittee on Court Administration for a report back to the current
 session of the Conference. Because of a delay in preparation of
  some circuit publication plans, this study could not be undertaken
  and, therefore, the Conference approved an extension to Decem­
. ber 31, 1973 of the time for the filing by each circuit of a report,
  including statistics of the experience of the circuit in its opinion
  publication plan. Such reports and statistical data are to be fur­
  nished to the Director of the Administrative Office for transmittal
 to the committee.

        QUALIFICATION STANDARD FOR JUNIOR LAW CLERK

  The Conference approved the following qualification standard
for the position of junior law clerk (or crier-law clerk) at JSP 9:
  Minimum Qualifications-Graduation from a law school of recognized standing
(or the completion of all law school studies and merely awaiting conferment of
degree). but with little or no experience.
                                      6

                  CHIEF DEPUTY CLERK POSITIONS

   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of Grade JSP 15 for the
chief deputy clerks in the large clerks' offices of the courts of appeals
and in the large district courts with the proviso that a chief deputy's
salary shall not exceed the first of the within-grade steps which
meets or exceeds 90 percent of the per annum salary of the clerk
of that court.
                    COURT OF ApPEALS PERSONNEL

  Upon the request of Chief Judge Brown of the Fifth Circuit, the
Conference directed the Director of the Administrative Office to
resubmit to the Congress legislation to meet the personnel require­
ments of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to include a
complement of staff attorneys and additional personnel, as follows:
Secretary for each judge______________________________________________     15
I.aw clerk for each judge_____________________________________________     15
Clerical assistant for each jlldge______________________________________   15
Assistant secretary for the Chief Judge_______________________________      1

                               LEGISLATION

reports and the applicability of the advisory opinions of the Interim
Advisory Committee;

  JOINT COMMITTEE 	ON STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL
                  CONDUCT
   The Judicial Conference at its April 1972 session (ConI. Rept.,
-pp. 23, 24) authorized the appointment of a committee, including
the members of the Review Committee and the Interim Advisory
Committee on Judicial Activities, to examine the report of the
American Bar Association's Special Committee on Judicial Con­
duct which was then expected to be approved by the House of Dele­
gates of the ABA in August 1972. The combined committee was
ch~ed with reporting back to the Conference on the feasibility of
adopting this report as applying to all federal judges and to de­
termine whether any additional standards may be needed in the
federal system. Subsequently, Judges Irving R. Kaufman and Ed­

     95-607-73---3
                                         10 

  ward T. Gignoux who were members of the ABA committee were
  appointed members of the combined committee to carry out the­
  Conference resolution.
     Judge Tuttle reported to the Conference on the recommendations
  of the Joint Committee. The Code of Judicial Conduct prepated by
  the Special Committee on Standards of Judicial Conduct of the
  American Bar Association was adopted by the House of Delegates
  <In August 16, 1972. The Judicial Conference, on recommendation
  of the Joint Committee, adopted the Code of Judicial Conduct as
  thus approved to be applicable to all federal judges, full-time ref­
  erees in bankruptcy and full-time magistrates, with the following
  modifications.
     (1) The adoption of the Code will not restrict any functions or
  privileges accorded by statute or resolution of the Conference to
  part-time magistrates, part-time referees in bankruptcy or special
  masters;
     (2) The adoption of the Code will not abrogate or modify any
- <conflicting provisions of statutes or resolutions of the Conference.
  Except as provided in number (1) above, to the extent that any
  part of the enumerated statutes or Conference action is less restric­
  tive than the Code, the latter will control;
     (3) The provisions of the Code relating to "Effective Date of
  Compliance" shall be modified to read as follows:
     A person to whom this Code becomes applicable should arrange his affairs as
 soon as reasonably possible to comply with it and should do so in any event
  within the period of one year. If, however, the demands on his time and the
 possibility of condict8 of interest are not substantial, a person who holds judicial
 .office on the date this Code becomes effective may continue to act, without com­
 pensation, as an executor, administrator, trustee, or other fiduciary for the es­
 tate or person of one who is not a member of his family, if terminating such
 relationship would unnecessarily jeopardize any substantial interest of the
 estate or person;

    (4) The entire commentary under Canon 5C(2), (including the
 blackface, bracketed material) is deleted;             ­
    (5) It is the sen~e of the Conterencethat referees in bankruptcy
 shall not be required by any provisions of the Code to disql,1alify
 themselves because -of any financial interest in any uncon,te.sted,
 matter.
  . The Joint Committee was directed to give further study to the
 provisions of Canon 7 as it uniquely relates to feder~l judg~..
  In providing that the adoption of the Code will not abrogate or
modify any conflicting provisions of statutes or resolutions of the
Conference, tlie Conference noted particularly the following stat­
utes and resolutions:

   ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES
   Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman, presellted the report of the
Advisory Committee.
   The Conference agreed that upon adoption of the report of the
Joint Committee the Advisory Committee should continue in ex­
istence but should ho longer be termed an interim committee. .
   The Conference was further of the view that the committee
should be authoriwd to reply to inquiries not only from federal
                                  12 

'judges but from all referees in bankruptcy and magistrates, whether
 flin':time;or part-time appointees. "
-. Judge Tuttle reported tha.t only one formal opinion (Number
 26) had been handed down by the committee since the last session
 -of the Conference. This opinion expressed the view of the commit­
 tee that a judge's enjoyment of the Blue Cross-Blue Shield cover­
 age was not a disqualification in litigation between either or both
,of these organizations or other insurors who are in competition for
>coverage of doctors and hospital services.
   COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY 

                  SYSTEM 

  Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman of the Committee on the
Operation of the Jury System, presented the committee's report
to the Conference.
                     GRAND JUROR UTILIZATION

  It was pointed out to the Conference that the Administrative
 Office does not have ,adequate statistical records to determine
whethergz:and jurors are being utilized efficiently. At the present
 time the Administrative Office now spends in excess of$3,OOO,OOO
 for grand jurors. Accordingly, the Conference agreed to adopt the
 following policies:
     (1) :Each clerk of court should maintain the following minimal
-Statistical records: ''
        (a) 	An order impaneling the grand jury;
       (b) 	A sign-in sheet or equivalent record that will show at:'
             tendance of grand jurors on a daily basis and the total
, ,"         hours served on each day of service;                     :
       (c) Copies of 	payroll vouchers of individual gr.and jurors
             and covering payroll vouchers for each grand jury;
       (d) Grand jury votes on indictment;
       (e) Any order extending the term of grand jury; and the order
             discharging the grand jury ;
     (2) For the convenience of grand jurors and to achieve the maxi­
'mum utilization of their services, sessions should be scheduled for
,days certain wh~n a sufficient accumulation of business exis~s fully
to occupy their time.                           '                '

PERIODIC REPORT UNDER THE JURY SELECTION AND SERVICE              ACT
    At its October 1969 session (Conf. Rept., p. 65), the Conference
 approved regulations implementing reporting requirements of the
 Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968. The Conference agreed with
. the recommendations of the· committee to make the following
 amendments to these regulations:
    (1) The filing date in Regulation 1 for periodic reports is­
 changed from September 1, 1971 to March 1, 1974 to reflect the
 new timetable for refilling master jury wheels fixed by Public Law
 92-,-269 which lowers the juror age to 18 ;
    (2) Regulation 4 is amended to omit the requirement of occu­
 pational data for those persons covered by periodic reports;
    (3) The reference in Regulation 5 to distribution of reporting
 forms "prior to September 1, 1971" is omitted.
           NEW JUROR QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE

  Public Law 92-437 requires a response to questions on the juror
qualification form seeking the race and occupation of prospective
jurors. Accordingly, the Administrative Office and the committee
redesigned the juror qualification form to comply with this statute
and the Conference approved the new form.
                  BIFURCATION OF JURY TRIALS

   The Conference approved the distribution of a report prepared'
after an extensive survey on the use of bifurcated trials in civil jury
cases for determining liability and damages. The Conference noted
the suggestion of the committee that the final decision on using
bifurcated juries should be left to the discretion of the judge after
careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages thereof
for the particular situation.
                       SIZE OF CIVIL JURIES

 . -The Conference, with the Chairman taking no part in the discus­
sion, reaffirmed its support of legislation which would revise the'
number of jurors in civil trials to six persons and the number of per-·
emptory challenges to two.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

               CRIMINAL LAW 

  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Crim­
inal Law was presented by the Committee Chairman, Judge Al­
fonso J. Zirpoli. The report of the Subcommittee on the Study of
the New Criminal Code was presented by Subcommittee Chair­
man, Judge Ruggero J. Aldisert.
                          WITNESS FEES

   The Conference approved the Department of Justice's draft bill
to amend 28 U.S.C. 1821 to provide that witnesses required to
travel are entitled to the actual reasonable expenses of travel and
to provide that witnesses held for want of security for their appear­
ance are entitled to receive $20 per day rather than the $1.00 per
day now provided.

                  JUVENILE DELINQUENCY ACT

   The Conference approved a committee recommendation to
amend 18 U.S.C. 5031 to provide that the Juvenile Delinquency
Act shall not be applicable to petty offenses. This amendment is
necessary to empower United States magistrates to process petty
offenses involving juveniles who commit petty offenses on federal
enclaves, particularly traffic violations which run into the hundreds
each year.
             NARCOTIC ADDICT REHABILITATION ACT

   The Conference noted that its views had been requested on four
bills, H.R. 1540, H.R. 5612, H.R. 10453 and H.R. 15760, all 92nd
Congress, which would amend the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation
Act of 1966 by expending the provisions of Titles 18 and 28 of the
United States Code relating to the treatment of drug-dependent
persons. The Conference agreed that these bills all involved policy
matters for the decision of the Congress and; accordingly, took no
action with respect to these bills.
           STANDARDS FOR DISCHARGE AND DISMISSAL

  To implement the provisions of Section 844 (b)(l) of Title 21,
United States Code, the Conference approved a standard order for
the discharge and dismissal of defendants, as follows:
                                      15 

  The Court, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 844(1)) (I) hereby discharges defendant from
probation and dismisses those proceedings under which probation had been
ordered and orders that the case files and other court records pertinent to this
case be sealed and turned over to the clerk of this court.

              PROPOSED NEW FEDERAL CRIMINAL CODE

   The Judicial Conference of the United States, taking note of the
report of the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law
calling its attention to various measures that have been proposed
to the Congress for the enactment of a new Federal Criminal Code,
and considering, on the one hand, the danger of rendering the
great body of precedent developed over the past obsolete and, on
the other, the desirability of curing many anomalies and incon­
sistencies in the present Code:
   (1) Approved in principle the proposal for a new or amended
Federal Crimipal Code consisting of three parts, the first of which
would outline the bases of federal jurisdiction and prescribe certain
principles of general application, the second of which would define
specific crimes and their jurisdictional bases, and the third of which
would deal with sentences; and
   (2) Accepted the report of the Committee on the Administra­
tion of the Criminal Law which deals with the first part of the pro­
posed measures, directed that the report be forwarded to the Con­
gress without prejudice to reconsideration of specific items by the
committee and by the Conference as may seem wise in the light of
future developments, and instructed the committee to continue its
work on other parts of the proposed measures and to submit further
reports to the Conference or, if developments should require, di­
rectly to the Congress, as soon as practicable.
              COMMITTEE ON HABEAS CORPUS
  Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman of the committee, submit­
ted a written report, relating to S. 567, a bill which provides for
certain amendments to Sections 2253, 2254 and 2255 of Title 28,
United States Code. This bill is identical with S.3833, 92nd Con­
gress, which the Conference had previously regarded as a policy
matter for the consideration of the Congress. Afrerconsiderable
discussion it wa-s decided that the Congress should have the oonefit
of judicial experience in the field of habeas corpus and, accord­
ingly, agreed that if the views of the Conference are requested on
                                      16 

this legislation the committee should study the problem in depth
and avail itself, if necessary, of the resources of the Federal Judicial
Center in order to submit a meaningful report based on judicial
experience to the Congress.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

             BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

           SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

         homa City to become vacant by expiration of term on August 31, 1973,
         for a term of six years, effective September 1,1913, at the present salary,

         main as at present.

  No recommendations were requested for continuation of two
terms of office of referees in bankruptcy which were to expire at
Mobile in the Southern District of Alabama and at Los Angeles in
the Central District of California.
                REFEREES' SALARY AND EXPENSE FuND

   The Conference was advised that in fiscal year 1973 the recur­
ring expenses of the bankruptcy system. were estimated at
$19,851,000, while payment to the Referees' Salary and Expense
Fund is estimated at $13,200,000. This would result in a deficit of
$6,651,000 which will make the eighth consecutive year in which'
receipts have not equaled disbursements. The Conference was in­
formed that, to bring the Fund into balance, all fifty-dollar filing
fees would have to be increased to ninety dollars and that fees in
Chapter XIII wage-earner cases would have to be increased to
forty dollars. In addition, an increase in the percentage charges of
one-half of one percent would be needed. After full consideration,
the Conference agreed not to make any changes in filing fees or fee
schedules, which is consistent with the position tak~n by the Con­
ference at its March 1969 and April 1972 sessions.
                                  LEGISLATION

  Although noting that several bills relating to the Bankruptcy
Act had been introduced'in the 92nd Congress, the Conference
agreed to take, no 1,lCtiQn on fillY legislative proPosals untflthe

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
            MAGISTRATES SYSTEM
  Judge Charles M. Metzner, Chairman of the Committee on the:
Administration of the Magistrates System, presented the report
of the committee.

                               SALARY INCREASES

   The committee recommended that the 5.14 percent compara­
bility salary increase recently granted to government employees
generally pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5301 be authorized for the part­
time United States magistrates other than those whose present
salary is higher than that justified by present caseloads or who
have recently received a significant increase in salary. It was the
view of the committee that the comparability increase should not
be authorized for those magistrates who already receive adequate
compensation for the performance of their duties. Upon recom­
mendation of the corhmittee, the Conference approved the pay
increases in accordance with the schedule appended to the com­
mittee's report.
                            MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

   The committee reported that it had considered various requests
for the creation of additional magistrate positions, changes in
salaries of magistrates and changes in arrangements. These re­
quests have also been considered by the judicial councils of the
circuits. In accordance with the recommendation of the committee,
the Conference approved the following changes in the numbers,
locations, arrangements, and salaries of magistrates and directed
that, unless otherwise noted, thef:3~changes be made effective at
such time as appropriated funds are available.

                  ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS 

  The Conference, upon recommendation of the committee, ap­
proved a change in Section 1.1 of the REGULATIONS OF THE
DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, relating
to the payment of the salary of part-time magistrates, by deleting
the reference to a yearly payment of the salary of magistrates earn­
ing $600 or less per year.

                   SERVICE AS SPECIAL MASTER
   The committee reported that it had received an inquiry concern­
ing the propriety of taxing civil litigants fees for work performed
by a full-time magistrate serving as a special master. Upon recom­
mendation of the committee, the Conference decided, as a matter
of policy, that no fees should be taxed to the litigants for the serv­
ices performed by a full-time United States magistrate serving
under appointment as a special master.
   The committee was authorized to consider further the propriety
of a part-time magistrate accepting a fee for service as a special
master.
                      CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
   The Chief Judge of the Eastern District of Virginia had requested
a change in Rule 4 of the conflict-of-interest rules adopted by the
Conference in March 1969 (Conf. Rept., p. 33) so as to permit the
partners and associates of a part-time United States magistrate to
participate in any criminal case in the federal court in which the
magistrate serves; provided that the magistrate had no prior con­
nection with the case. The Conference approved the recommenda­
tion of the committee that no change be made in this conflict-of­
interest rule.

   COMMITTEE 	ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
              PROBATION SYSTEM
  Judge Albert C. Wollenberg, Chairman of the Committee on the
Administration of the Probation System, presented the committee
report.
                                      24 

        BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS OF NEW ApPOINTEES

   The Conference at its September 1968 session (Conf. Rept., pp.
68-69) instructed the Director of the Administrative Office to
arrange for a full-field investigation by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation of the background of each person appointed as a
probation officer. The Conference noted that of the 168 additional
officers authorized by the Congress for fiscal year 1973, by February
1973 17 district courts had appointed a total of 33 probation officers
prior to the completion of the investigation by the F.RI. Subse­
quently, several of the investigative report-s revealed information
which, in the view of the committee, should have been available to
the court for consideration before the applicant was appointed.
Accordingly, the Conference adopted the committee recommenda­
tion and instructed the Director of the Administrative Office that
he is not to pla.ce on the payroll any person appointed to the posi­
tion of probation officer until the F.RI. investigation has been
completed and a summary of the results of the investigation has
been furnished to the appointing court, except when the Director
of the Administrative Office determines that an emergency situa­
tion requiring immediate appointment exists.

                        SENTENCING INSTITUTES

  The Conference resolved that henceforth the Federal Judicial
Center, in cooperation with the Committee on the Administration
of the Probation System and the Attorney General of the United
States, shall assist in the formulation and preparation of all future
sentencing institutes held in accordance with the provisions of
Section 334 of Title 28, United States Code.
                                LEGISLATION

     (1) The Conference approved in principle the draft bill by
Senator Burdick to establish a Parole Commission. This bill is
a revision of S. 3993, 92nd Congress. The Conference noted its
specific approval of four basic principles in the bill, namely:
   (1) Regionalization of. Parole Board hearings and original actions with pro­
vision for appeal to the National Parole Commission;
   (2) That applicants for parole be allowed to select a non-lawyer advocate;
   (3) That applicants for parole and their advocates shall have reasonable
access to their files with certain exceptions; and
                                     25 

  (4) That the Parole Commission shall furnish ea(!h appli(!ant for parole a
written statement of reasons for its actions when the appli(!ation Is denied.

If access to any part of the presentence investigation report is
denied, the Commission must summarize the basic content thereof
and furnish the summary to the inmate or his advocate. The Con­
ference agreed with the committee recommendation that Section
4203(b) (4) which provides that the appropriate court may retain
the discretion to approve any such summary of any presentence
report be followed by the words "by written direction or order."
   (2) The Conference disapproved H.R. 1598, a bill which would
also create a regionalized Federal Board of Parole as an independ­
ent establishment in the Executive Branch, insofar as it varies from
the Parole Commission Act commented upon above. The Confer­
 ence specifically disapproved the proposal to provide for the
 judicial review of Parole Board decisions.
   (3) The Conference approved in principle n.R. 385, a bill which
would amend certain provisions of Chapter 311 of Title 18, United
States Code, relating to parole. The-Conference did, however, ques­
tion the desirability of requiring as a condition of eligibility for
release on parole that the prisoner "has made positive efforts toward
his own rehabilitation." The Conference also recommends that the
provisions of 18 U.S.C. 4208 (a) (2) which are omitted from n.R.
385 be restored.
   (4) The Conference approved in principle S. 798 which provides
that a committing officer on recommendation of the attorney for the
government may release a person charged with an offense against
the United States by diverting him to a voluntary program of
community supervision and services. The Conference, however, ex­
pressed the view that the federal probation system should be desig­
nated as the agency to provide the programs of supervision and
services rather than an agency of the Department of Justice and
that the Congress should authorize sufficient funds for the federal
probation system to provide these services. The Conference further
recommended that Section 3(4) of the proposed bill be amended
so as to define Clcommitting officer" as any judge or magistrate "in
any case in which he has potential trial jurisdiction or in any case
which has been assigned to him by the court for such purpose."

    COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
   Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman of the Committee on Inter­
circuit Assignments, presented the report of the committee.
   The report covered intercircuit assignments for the period Sep­
tember 15, 1972 to March 1, 1973. During this period the Com­
mittee recommended 89 assignments to be undertaken by 56 judges,
four of whom are circuit judges in active status, 13 senior circuit
judges, 11 district judges in active status and 22 senior district
judges. One retired Supreme Court Justice, one active and two
senior judges of the Court of Claims, one active judge of the Court
of Customs and Patent Appeals and one senior judge of the Customs
Court participated in 12 assignments. There were 49 assignments
to the courts of appeals, one to the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals and three to the Court of Claims.
  Judge Harper reported that the bulk of the regular intercircuit
assignments were carried out by senior judges and that most of the
assignments of active judges were for special purposes, such as
handling assignments in multidistrict litigation cases.

     COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                 JUSTICE ACT 

  Judge Roszel C. Thomsen, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act.
   The Conference noted and authorized for distribution the Report
of the Director of the Administrative Office on Appointments and
Payments under the Criminal Justice Act, as amended, for the
period ending December 31, 1972. During the first half of fiscal
year '73 private attorneys were appointed to represent 20,272 per­
sons. The federal public defenders and the community defender
organizations reviewed 4,902 cases. Over all, during the first half
of fiscal year 1973 there was an increase of 8.6 percent in the number
of persons represented, due in large measure to appointments in
petty offense cases, consistent with the Supreme Court decision in
Argersinger v. Hamlin. A substantial increase in discretionary ap­
pointments for probation violators, habeas corpus petitioners and
material witnesses also was noted.
   Payments to private attorneys appointed during fiscal year 1972
averaged $648 for services rendered in the courts of appeals and
$271 for services in the district courts of the United States. Claims
                                      27 

for compensation for attorneys in extended or complex representa­
tion as approved by the chief judges of the circuits in this period
aggregated $433,737 and averaged $2,106. A substantial increase
was noted in the first six months of fiscal 1973 in payments for
transcripts, investigative, expert and other services which aggre­
gated $325,684 as compared with $197,826 in the first six months
of fiscal year 1972. The largest element in this increase was for the
payment of transcripts.
   During fiscal year 1973 the sum of $1,775,000 was allocated for
the operation of the eight federal public defender offices and the
sum of $1,194,288 for the five community defender organizations
which operate on sustaining grants.
   The Conference also noted the report of the Director of the
Administrative Office furnished pursuant to the directive of the
Judicial Conference at the October 1972 session (Conf. Rept., p. 54)
which requires him to report on a semiannual basis to the chief
judges of the circuit and district courts the names of any attorneys
who during the preceding six-month period received more than
$6,000 as payment for services rendered pursuant to appointment
by that court under the Criminal Justice Act. The Conference noted
that the appropriate pages of the report have been sent to the
courts involved.

               COMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS

   Pursuant to the authority vested in it by Section (h) (2) of the
Criminal Justice Act, as amended, the Conference approved the
following grants to community defender organizations for fiscal
year 1974:
Federal Defender Program, Inc., Chicago, Illinois___________________    $204,000
Legal Aid and Defender Association of Detroit, Michigan_____________     208,000
Community Defender Organization of Minneapolis, Minnesota_________        29,910
Federal Defender Services Unit of the Legal Aid Society of New York__    650,000
Defender Association of Philadelphia_______________________________      202,000

                                GUIDELINES

   The Conference approved the adoption of two additional guide­
lines for use in implementing the Criminal Justice Act, as follows:
  In accordance with the decision in United States v. John Sun King Kang (9
CA, 468 F. 2nd 1368, decided October 5, 1972), counsel may be appointed under
the Criminal Jusnce Act, as amended, for a person charged with civil contempt
who faces loss of liberty for failure to comply with an order of the court.
                                      28 

  Xeither the Criminal Justice Act, as amended, nor Public Law 91-545, Decem­
ber 11, 1970, which amended 28 U.S.C. 753, requires that, in a direct appeal in
a case in which counsel is assigned pursuant to the Criminal Justice Aet, a
pauper's oath be signed for obtaining necessary parts of the transcript or, if
required, the entire transcript.

       COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                   PROCEDURE 

 Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman, presented the Report of the
Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.

                             CRIMINAL RULES

   Judge Maris reported that the standing committee and a sub­
committee of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules had met
with counsel of the Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedure
of the United States Senate pursuant to authority granted by the
Judicial Conference. at the October 1972 session (Conf. Rept., p. 47).
He stated that the committees were able to consider all of the pro­
posals contained in Title 2 of S. 1, 93rd Congress, and to reach a
unanimous judgment, with which counsel for the Senate subcom­
mittee concurred, as to those provisions which should be retained
in the statute, those which should be transferred to the Rules and
those which should be dropped as obsolete. The form which the
provisions should take which are to be transferred to the Rules was
agreed upon in principle and is being worked out in detail by the
reporter for the advisory committee to present to the Senate Sub­
committee in specific form at a later hearing.
  Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Criminal
Rules had approved amendments to the rules which have been
distributed to the bench and bar in pamphlet form, with Febru­
ary 1, 1974 as the deadline fixed for the receipt of comments and
suggestions.

                           BANKRUPTCY RULES

  Judge Maris stated that preliminary drafts of Chapter XI Rules
(Arrangements) and Chapter X Rules (Corporate Reorganizations)
are now before the bench and bar for comment. The advisory com­
mittee has also approved for publication a preliminary draft of
rules for proceedings under Chapter XII (Real Property Arrange­
ments) of the Bankruptcy Act which will be distributed to the
                                 29 

bench and bar shortly. Work is progressing or has been planned
on rules to cover Chapter IX (Composition of Indebtedness of
Local Taxing Agencies) and Section 77 of Chapter VIn (Railroad
Reorganization) .

               COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
   Judge Carl Weinman, Chairman of the Budget Committee, ad­
vised the Conference that the hearings on the 1974 appropriations
had been completed before both the House and Senate Subcommit­
tees on Appropriations.
   Judge Weinman stated that the request for the judiciary appro­
priation was approximately $16,000,000 higher than that of the
current fiscal year, with almost $7,000,000 of that amount attribut­
able to increased personnel for the federal probation service. The
appropriation for fiscal year 1973 was $188,840,600. In addition, a
supplemental in the amount of $6,313,000 is being sought for the
current fiscal year. The total request for fiscal year 1974 is in the
amount of $205,441,000.
   Judge Weinman pointed out to the Conference the desirability
in future years of having all committee reports which pertain to
the budget in the hands of the Administrative Office by July 15
in order to meet the requirements of the budget cycle. The need
for written justifications for any requests for additional appropria­
tions was also stressed.
   The Conference rejected the motion of Chief Judge Bazelon that
it rescind the antion taken at the October 1972 session (Conf. Rept.,
p.32) relating to Criminal Justice Act appropriations for the local
