       The Conference also noted that Judge Albert B. Maris had re­
     quested the Chief Justice to relieve him of his duties as Chairman
     of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure on October 1,
     1973, and adopted the following resolution commending Judge
     Maris for his service to the Judicial Conference:
        The Judicial Conference O'f the United States takes note O'f the retirement
     of Senior Judge Albert B. Maris as Chairman of the standing CO'mmittee of the
     Conference on Rules of Practice and Procedure after fifteen years of dedicated
     service. Judge Maris has been Chairman O'f the Committee since its inceptiO'n
     in 1958. Under his wise leadership the CO'mmittee has mO'dernized all aspects O'f
     practice and procedure in civil, criminal, admiralty and bankruptcy cases and
     has standardized appellate practice and procedure and developed II cO'mprehensive
     set of Ru1es of Evidence gO'verning the trial O'f cases in the district cO'urts.
        Judge Maris has not O'nly presided over the deliberations O'f the standing
     Committee but has participated extensively in the discussiO'ns at advisory
     committee meetings which he has faithfully attended. His wise counsel O'n diffi­
     cult problems has exerted a wholesO'me infiuence on the develO'pment of rules
     and he has never ceased to support affirmative action to' prO'vide rules to make the
     judicial system O'perate more effectively. Further, he has been a dedicated and
     effective spokesman fO'r the cause of improved procedures for the administra­
     tiO'n O'f justice. NO' man has given more O'f his magnificent abilities to this im­
     portant work nor has anyone accnmplished as much.
        The Cnnference desires to' honor Judge Maris, not O'nly fO'r his O'utstanding
     cO'ntribution to' the field of practice and procedure, but alsO' for his dedicatinn to
     the wO'rk O'f the Conference fO'r more than three decades. He has assisted in the
     wnrk O'f numerous cnmmittees of the Conference and from 1944 until 1967 he
     served as Chairman O'f the Conference CO'mmittee on Revision O'f the Laws, in­
     cluding the revisinn O'f the Judicial CO'de. He assisted in the formulatiO'n of the
     Codes O'f the Virgin Islands and was an advisO'r to' the Goveruments of Guam,
     American Samoa and the Trust TerritO'ry of the Pacific Islands in the reorgani­
     zatinn of its judiciary. He was a member of the United States Advisory Com­
     mIttee on InteruatiO'ual Rules O'f Judicial Prncedure, 1959-1963, and a member
     of the Advisory Committee to' the Secretary O'f State O'n Private InteruatiO'nal
     Law, 1964-1967.
        The United states Supreme CO'urt apPO'inted Judge Maris Special Master to
     determine a dispute between IllinO'is and the other Lake states as to' the diver­
     siO'n O'f water by Chicago from Lake Michigan. Judge Maris filed a massive report
     which was approved by the Supreme CO'urt. Judge Maris is presently acting as
     Special Master by Supreme Court appointment to determine whether the federal
     government O'r the states have proprietary right to exploit the seabed and the
     subsoil of the continental shelf beyond the three-mile limit on the Atlantic Coast.
        Beyond his skilled leadership on behalf O'f the Conference and its committees,
     his never-faiUng kindness, friendliness, gentleness and tact are well known to' all
     O'f us. He epitomizes the wise judge. We wish him many more years O'f good
     health and service as he approaches bis eightieth birthday.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE 

    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS 

    The Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Kirks, advised
the Conference that while the filings in the courts of appeals main­
tained the upward trend which began in 1958, there was for the
first time since 1960 a drop in the total civil and criminal case
filings in the district courts. Elaborating on the courts of appeals
Mr. Kirks said that filings increased eight percent while termina­
tions rose over nine percent in 1973. The pending caseload at the
end of the year in all of the courts of appeals reached 10,456, the
highest ever reported.
    Civil case filings in the district courts actually increased 2.5 per­
cent but the substantial decrease was in criminal filings, especially
in immigration cases and Selective Service Act violations.
    Mr. Kirks also noted a decline in bankruptcy cases but a con­
tinued increase in the caseloads of the probation service. In the
second full year of the operation of the magistrates system more
than 250,000 separate items of judicial business were disposed of.
    Mr. Kirks also submitted to the Conference his first report on
progress made in the operation of district court plans under Rule
50(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Since the rule
was implemented fully only in January 1973, the report was sub­
stantially confined to a six-month period. He noted that 28 of the
94 district court plans had adopted time limits suggested in the
model plan disseminated at the direction of the Conference virtually
without change, whereas other district plans evidence considerable
variations in time lag limits. The time limits for trial for defend­
ants in custody range from 45 days to 120 days.
               COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
    Judge Carl A. Weinman, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on the Budget.
    Judge Weinman stated that for fiscal year 1973 the sum of
$186,010,000 was available for the operation of the courts, the
Administrative Office and the Federal Judicial Center. The actual
(';ost of operations was $183,152,000. Judge Weinman noted that the
appropriation for salaries and expenses of United States magistrates
was not fully utilized due in part to delays in the recruitment and
appointment of magistrates and their supporting personnel.
                                   41 

   The budget estimates submitted to the Congress for fiscal year
1974, exclusive of the Supreme Court, were in the amount of
$199,243,000. Judge Weinman advised the Conference that the 1974
appropriation bill was at the time still before the Senate Appropria­
tions Committee. He said that supplemental appropriations for
fiscal year 1974 were being requested to take care of salary in­
creases granted in January 1973 and projected for the fall of 1973.
The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to submit to the Congress requests for supplemental appro­
priations for fiscal year 1974 as may be necessary.
   The Committee requested and the Conference approved esti­
mates for fiscal year 1975 in the sum of $213,031,000. In addition,
the Conference directed the Committee to seek funds for the estab­
lishment of ten positions of deputy circuit executive in ten of the
eleven circuits at a salary of $30,000 per year and directed the
Committee to seek such funds as may be necessary to implement
the Conference action transferring to the Administrative Office the
inspection function of the federal courts now performed by the
Department of Justice (see report of the Committee on Court
Administration, p. 50).
   The following is a summary of the requests for additional per­
sonnel and major items of expense included in the budget for fiscal
year 1975:
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals ($793,000)
  Provision has been made for the employment of assistant tech­
nical advisors for the judges.
Court of Claims ('2,252,000)
   Includes a request for a secretary for senior (retired) commis­
sioners recalled to serve the court pursuant to Public Law 92-375.
  On Motion the Conference authorized an amendment to the
budget for the Court of Claims t-o include funds for expenses to be
incurred in the disposition of claims under Section 20, Public Law
92-203, the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act.
Salaries of Judges ($27,975,000)
  Provides for an anticipated increase in senior judges.
                                 42
Salaries of Supporting Personnel ($9,908,300)
   Provision has been made for 742 new positions, including 12
deputy clerks for the courts of appeals, 118 deputy clerks for the
district courts, 320 probation officers, and 199 clerk-stenographers
for the Probation Service. The estimate also includes funds for
salary adjustments for court reporters based on new classification       i
standards approved by the Judicial Conference in March 1971.             I
                                                                         !
                                                                        .:
Representation by Court-Appointed Counsel and Operation of
     Defender Organizations ($15,500,000)
  The Conference approved the budget estimates for the operation
                                                                        I
                                                                        .)
of the respective Federal public defender offices. Funds otherwise       i
                                                                         i
available for panel attorneys are to be diverted to the operation
of defender organizations and, therefore, no increase in budgetary
requirements is anticipated.
Fees of Jurors ($18,500,000)
   No increase requested. Any increase in petit jury trials and trial
days is expected to be offset by savings resulting from the use of
six-man juries in civil trials and improvements in the utilization
of jurors.
Travel and Miscellaneous Expenses ($15,091,000)
   The sum of $1,677,000 was included to cover expenses relating
to requests for new personnel. Provisions also have been made for
improvements in telephone services, increases in the rental of photo­
copy equipment, the procurement of lawbooks, and other miscel­
laneous expenses.
Salaries and Expenses, U.S. Magistrates ($8,565,000)
  Provisions have been made for the additional magistrates, con­
version of some part-time magistrates to full-time, and salary ad­
justments approved by the Judicial Conference in April 1973 and
September 1973.
Salaries of Referees ($6,975,000)
   The amount approved is $16,000 below the amount available in
fiscal year 1974 to take into account the discontinuance of a part­
time referee position at Johnstown, Pa.
Expenses of Referees ($13,353,000)
   The estimate does not provide for any additional clerical person­
nel for referees in view of the sharp decline in bankruptcy case
                                  43 

filings. Provisions, however, have been made for increases in the
cost of telephone services and for the procurement of furniture and
equipment.
Rental of Space
    The Conference also authorized the inclusion of a separate line
item in the budget of approximately $78,000,000 to reimburse the
General Services Administration for the rental of office space, alter­
ations, and other related services for the courts (including the Cus­
toms Court), the Federal Judicial Center, and the Administrative
Office as required by Public Law 92-313. It was noted that the
Congress has under consideration a bill which would exempt the
judiciary from paymen t of these charges.

                  COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration, Judge
Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., presented the Committee's report.
      UNIFORM ADMISSIONS AND DISCIPLINE OF ATTORNEYS

    Judge Ainsworth advised that there is at present no great dis­
 parity in the requirements for admission to practice in the several
 district courts, either for permanent admission or by way of pro hac
 vice admission, nor is there general dissatisfaction with the present
practice and procedure and, accordingly, the Committee recom­
mended against the promulgation of any uniform rule for admis­
sion to the bar of the courts of the United States.
   With respect to discipline, however, there is no uniformity of
practice. A survey among the district courts shows that only three
avail themselves of the services of the United States Attorneys in
their districts to investigate unethical conduct' or other conduct
unbecoming a member of the bar who is subj~ct to disciplinary
action. In a majority of instances state bar grievance committees
and procedures are utilized. In other instances, special committees
of the bar are appointed. These committees normally lack adequate
funding or personnel to make proper inquiry. The Conference,
therefore, on recommendation of the Committee approved for
transmittal to the Congress a draft bill which would result in regu­
larizing disciplinary procedures in all federal courts by permitting a
court to request the Department of Justice, through the Federal
                                        44 

Bureau of Investigation, to investigate charges that a member of
the bar of a court of the United States has been guilty of unethical
conduct or other conduct unbecoming a member of the bar and is
subject to disciplinary action. The bill would further authorize the
Attorney General to prosecute on request of the court formal disci­
plinary proceedings against a member of the bar of a court of the
United States. If the court is of the view that it would be improper
for the Attorney General to prosecute these proceedings, the court
may appoint a special prosecutor for this purpose.
                                     CASES

ARBITRATION IN EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CoMMISSION
                         CASES
   The American Arbitration Association requested endorsement
by the Conference of a proposal under the terms of which some 30
persons would be trained periodically by the National Center for
Dispute Settlements, hopefully thereafter to be appointed by dis­
trict judges, to serve as masters under Rule 53 FRCP in E.E.O.C.
discrimination cases. The Conference was advised that such en­
dorsement was being sought to permit the Association to solicit
funds for the proposed training program. The Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission which originally endorsed the Associa­
tion's proposal has now expressed serious misgivings, stating that
the appointment of masters would be calculated to cause delay in
the disposition of discrimination cases and that there was no ready
solution to the question of payment of masters' fees. In view of
this fact, the Conference disapproved the proposal of the American
Arbitration Association.
                   FILING FEES IN FEDERAL COURTS

   At the April 1973 session (Conf. Rept., p. 4) the Conference
approved the recommendation of the Congress which will place
authority to fix all fees in the federal courts in the Judicial Con­
ference. Because of the long period of years in which no changes
have been made in any fees in the federal courts, the Conference
decided to exercise the authority it now has and adopted the fol­
lowing fee changes to be effective November 1, 1973:
A. 	 Fees to be Paid to QZerks Of tM Qourts of Appeals (except tbat no fees are
       to be charged on behalf of the United States)
  L For docketing a case on appeal or review, or docketing any other proceeding,
$50.00. A separate fee shall be paid by each party filing a notice of appealln the
                                         45 

district court, but parties filing a joint notice of appeal in the district court are
required to pay only one fee. A docketing fee shall not be charged for the docket­
ing of an application for the allowance of an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.
1292 (b), unless the appeal is allowed.
  2. For every search of the records of tbe court and certifying the results of
the same, $2.00.
  3. For certifying any document or paper, whether the certification is made
directly on the document, or by separate instrument, $1.00.
  4. For making a typed copy of any record or paper, $1.00 per page of 250 words
or fraction thereof. For reproducing any record or paper (by any means other
than retyping), 50 cents per page. These fees do not include certification.
  5. For comparing with the original thereof any copy of any transcript of record,
entry, record or paper, when such copy is furnished by any person requesting
certification, $1.00 per page or fraction thereof. This fee is in addition to the fee
for certification.
  The Conference agreed that nothing in the foregoing shall be
construed to prevent the clerk of any court of appeals with the
approval of the court from charging and collecting a fee for each
copy of an opinion as shall be fixed by the court.
 B. 	Fees to be Oharged for Service Performed b11 Olerks of the District Oourts
         (except that no fees are to be charged for services rendered on behalf of
        the United States)
    1. For filing or indexing any paper not in a case or proceeding for which a
 case filing fee has been paid, $1.00. This fee is applicable to the registration of
a judgment, 28 U.S.C. 1963; the filing of a petition to perpetuate testimony, Rule
27(a), F.R. Civ. P.; the filing of papers by t.rustees under 28 U.S.C. 754; and the
filing of letters rogatory or letters of request.
   2. For filing a requisition for and certifying the results of a search of the
records of the court for judgments, decrees, other instruments, suits pending, and
bankruptcy proceedings, $2.00 for each name searched.
    3. For certifying any document or paper, whether the certification is made
directly on the document or by separate instrument, $1.00.
    4. For making a typed coPY of any record or paper. except a copy of a writ for
service on a party in a suit or action covered in 28 U.S.C. 1914(a), $1.00 per page
of 250 words or fraction thereof. For reproducing any record or paper (by any
means other than retyping), 50 cents per page. These fees do not include certi­
fication. With respect to copies of opinions of the district courts, the price is to
be fixed by the court by local rule or order at 25 cents a page but not lesS' than
$1.00 per opinion.
    5. For comparing with the original thereof any copy of any transcript of
record, entry, record or paper, when such copy is furnished by any person re­
questing certification, $1.00 per page or fraction thereof. This fee is in addition
to the fee for certification.
    6. For the preparation and mailing of each set of notices in asset cases and
in cases filed under the relief chapters of the Bankruptcy Act, in excess of 80
notices per set, 25 cents for each additional notice on the first 10;000 and 15
cents per notice on the balance, provided that in no event shall this charge
exceed 25 pereent of the net proceeds realized in asset cases.
   'to For admission of attorneys to practice, $10.00 each including a certificate
of admission. For a duplicate certificate of admission, $2.00.
                                46 

                       TERRITORIAL JUDGES

  The Conference approved H.R. 6963, 93rd Congress, providing
a formula under the terms of which the total per annum rate of
salary or proportion of salary payable to a judge of a territory or
possession of the United States under Section 373 of Title 28,
United States Code, shall be increased periodically by one percent,
plus the present percent rise in the Consumer Price Index. The
proposed bill includes judges who retired under the provisions of
Section 371 (a) of Title 28, United States Code, and provides that
in no case shall the salary increased by this bill exceed the salary
such justice or judge would receive were he still in active service.
These two latter provisions meet the objections made by the Con­
ference to similar legislation in the 92nd Congress (Conf. Rept.,
October 1972, p. 34).
                    STATE CoURT ASSISTANCE

  The Conference voted its disapproval of S. 1629 which provides
for the creation within the Federal Judicial Center of a Division of
State Court Assistance, the purpose of which is to assist state and
local governments in studying improvements in the administration
of state courts. The Conference noted that the Board of the Fed­
eral Judicial Center had likewise disapproved such legislation in
principle.
                   PLACES OF HOLDING CoURT

  The Conference voted its disapproval of S. 1504, a bill to provide
for the holding of court at Muskegon in the Western District of
Michigan, although it had the approval of the District Court and
of the Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit (when court facilities
are made available at no expense to the government). The Con­
ference was of the view, however, that no information as to the
reasons for the proposal or the need for designating Muskegon had
been received and further that Muskegon was a relatively short
distance from Grand Rapids, an authorized place of holding court.
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  The Conference noted that requests for comment had been re­
ceived on a number of bills to provide for additional district judge­
                                         47 

ships since the submission of the 1972 quadrennial survey. The
Conference reaffirmed its previous policy to recommend additional
district judgeships to the Congress on a quadrennial basis and in
the interim period to make recommendations for new judgeships
only when these can be justified on an emergency basis.
                           SUPPORTING PERsoNNEL

   The Conference approved the following recommendations re­
lating to supporting personnel:
   1. That 32 additional positions be approved for the clerks' offices of the courts
of appeals. This will permit sufficient deputy clerks for the courts of appeals to
adjust the ratio of deputy clerks to the filings projected for fiscal year 1915 to
1 to 75.
   2. That sufficient additional positions be approved for the clerks' office of the
district courts to adjust the ratio of deputy clerks to civil and criminal filings
projected for the various courts for fiscal year 1915 to 1 to 100 for the district
courts.
   8. That the fiscal year 1975 requirements for probation officers and clerk-stenog­
raphers ,be the total of the unfulfilled requests for fiscal year 1914 and the new
requirements established for fiscal year 1915.
   4. Tht there be approved one assistant librarian for the Third Circuit (in lieu
of the present part-time assistant librarian).
   5. That there be approved seven pool law clerks and six pool secretaries for the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
  6. That there be approved two supervisory positions, classifications not to
exceed grade JSP-13 and JSP-12, respectively, for middle managers in clerks'
offices of the courts of appeals based upon standards which shall be promulgated
by the Director of the Administrative Office.

                            EN BANe HEARINGS

   The Conference approved a proposal for legislation to amend
Section 46(c) of Title 28, United States Code, and authorized the
transmittal thereof to the Congress. The amendment would make
clear that a majority of the judges in regular active service who are
entitled to vote should .be sufficient to en bane a case. Under the
present statute, there must be a vote of a majority of the circuit
judges in regular active service which has been construed to mean
that if there is a vacancy a majority of the judges actually on the
court will suffice but if a judge disqualified himself there must still
be a majority of the entire membership voting for an en bane
sitting.


      1523-410-13-3
                                      48
   DIVISION OF JURISDICTION BETW1<JEN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS

   The Conference reaffirmed in principle its support of S. 1876,
93rd Congress, an updated version of the same numbered bill in the
previous Congress embodying the recommendations of the Ameri­
can Law Institute on the division of jurisdiction between state and
federal courts. The Conference believes that the changes which
have been made do not deviate from the principal recommenda­
tions of the original bill and the American Law Institute's proposals
and on the whole reaffirmed the position that these proposals are
well conceived, workable and based upon acceptable compromise of
variant views of the bench and bar.

                                LEGISLATION

  The Conference considered three bills relating in large measure
to consumer matters and agreed that they involved primarily legis­
lative policy upon which the Judicial Conference should not com­
ment, except to urge the Congress to consider the impact upon the
federal courts which such legislation would have:
  1. n.R. 839, to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to extend protection
against fraudulent or deceptive practices. condemned by the Act. to consumers
through civil actions, and to provide for class actions for acts in defraud of
consumers;
  2. n.R. 1848, and n.R. 1652, to require that certain processed or packaged
consumer products be labeled with certain information; and
  3. S. 770, to establish an independent agency to be known as the Intergovern­
mental Office of Consumers' Counsel to represent the consnmers of the nation
before federal and state regulatory agencies; provides grants and other federal
assistance to state and local governments to establish and operate consumers'
counsel; and to improve methods of obtaining and disseminating information
with respect to the operations of regulated companies of interest to the federal
government and to other consumers.
  The Conference also considered and disapproved in its entirety
R.R. 4900 which would amend Title 28 of the United States Code
to provide for aggregation of claims in determining jurisdictional
amount in controversy.

                   EXAMINATION OF COURT OFFICES

   The Conference examined a thorough study which had been con~
ducted by an ad hoc group with the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration of the operations of the Office of Judicial Examinations of
                                 49 

 the Department of Justice insofar as these examinations include
 offices of clerks of court, magistrates, probation officers, referees
 and trustees in bankruptcy, court reporters and judicial personnel.
 The report noted that examinations of court offices varied from 3.8
 to 6 years; that when a report is completed it is submitted to the
 Administrative Office which in turn forwards the report to the
 chief judge of the circuit or district involved and that there is no
 follow-up system to determine whether effective corrective action
 is taken.
     The Committee report further noted that there would be distinct
advantages to transferring these examinations to the Administrative
 Office which already devotes a substantial amount of time and per­
 sonnel in day-to-day dealings with the clerks' offices and other
 judicial offices. These contacts relate to the amount and training of
 personnel, salaries, volume and flow of work, ratio of personnel to
 filings, budget estimates, improvement and adoption of uniform
 forms, dockets, administrative procedures, purchase and use of busi­
 ness machines and similar equipment, as well as the periodic review
 of clerks' records for the purpose of reporting status concerning
 filings, determinations and types of cases, trials per judgeship,
 length of trials, interim between issue and trial, juror utilization
 and juror management and usage.
     The Administrative Office works closely with the clerks with
 reference to court-appointed counsel, with the federal public de­
 fenders, probation officers, bankruptcy courts and the magistrates,
'as well as the Federal Judicial Center in undertaking surveys and
 studies in all of these areas and in the training of personnel.
     The Conference agrees with the Committee's conclusion that if
 inspections and examinations were made by inspectors from the
 Administrative Office, they would be more accurately attuned to
 the day-to-day problems and requirements of the federal judiciary;
 also implementation of recommendations could be more closely
 coordinated and achieved. This would result in building up a reser­
 voir of experience, information and insigh t concerning the functions
 of the courts that could be drawn upon in many other ways and
could strengthen the capability and understanding of that office.
 The Conference sees no validity in the argument that it would be
 undesirable for the Administrative Office to inspect and audit indi­
 vidual courts inasmuch as the Administrative Office does not act as
                                 50 

the agent of a particular court but as the representative of the
Judicial Conference. The Conference further believes that the cost
of the transfer of such functions to the Administrative Office would
not be higher than the present costs. The Committee on the Budget
was, therefore, requested to secure appropriations to enable the
Administrative Office to commence and discharge this examination
and inspection function for fiscal year 1975.

                   DEPUTY CIRCUIT EXECUTIVE

   The Committee, by mail vote, approved a motion on the floor of
the Conference to provide for an assistant for each of the circuit
executives at rates of compensation to be determined by the respec­
tive circuit councils, not to exceed $30,000 per annum. The Subcom­
mittee on Supporting Personnel had likewise approved the motion.
  The Budget Committee was instructed to seek funds for this
purpose in the 1975 appropriation (see p. 41).

                 RETIREMENT OF CHIEF JUDGES

  At the October 1971 session of the Judicial Conference (Conf.
Rept., p. 77), the Conference noted that Section 3 of Public Law
85-593 provided in part that the amendment of Section 136, Title
28, United States Code, relating to the office of chief judge of the
district would not be effective with respect to any district having
two judges in regular active service so long as the district judge
holding the office of chief judge of any such district on August 6,
1958, continued to hold such a position.
  The Conference reiterated the view expressed in 1971 that this
legislative proviso had outlived its usefulness and directed the
Administrative Office to forward to the Congress a proposed bill
to carry out the views of the Conference.

                    REVIEW COMMITTEE
  Judge Tamm advised the Conference that as of its meeting on
August 13, 1973, the Committee had reviewed the reports of 592
judges, 168 referees in bankruptcy and 87 magistrates. He said
that at that time 30 judges, 14 referees in bankruptcy and one
magistrate had not filed. At the time of the Conference, Septem­
ber 13, 1973, there were still 17 judges, four referees in bank­
ruptcy and one magistrate who had not filed reports for the six­
                                       51 

month period ending June 30, 1973, and, therefore, pursuant to the
resolution of the Conference at its March 1971 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 24), and subsequently amended to include full-time referees in
bankruptcy and magistrates, they are as follows:

   Judge Tamm advised the Conference that the adoption at the
April 1973 session of the Code of Judicial Conduct with some modi­
fications created new problems of interpretation on which the
views of the Advisory Committee on Judicial Activities should be
solicited. After some discussion, it was agreed that the Review
Committee should present these problems directly to the Advisory
Committee.

   JOINT COMMITTEE 	ON STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL
                   CONDUCT
  Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Co-Chairman with Judge Edward A.
Tamm of the Joint Committee on Standards of Judicial Conduct,
presented the Committee's report.
   The Joint Committee was authorized by the Judicial Conference
at the April 1972 session (Conf. Rept., pp. 23-24). The Committee
reported to the April 1973 session of the Conference (Conf., Rept.
pp. 9-11). At that time the Committee was directed by the Con­
ference to give further study to Canon 7 of the American Bar
Association's Code of Judicial Conduct insofar as Canon 7 relates
uniquely to federal judges. In response to this mandate, the Joint
Committee recommended and the Conference approved Canon 7,
to read as follows:
                                      Canon 1

       A JUDGE SHOULD REFRAIN FROM POLITICAL AOTIVITY
A. Political conduct in general
   (1) A judge should not:
        (a) Act as a leader or hold any office in a political organization;
        (b) Make speeches for a political organization or candidate, or publicly
     endorse a candidate for public office;
         (c) Solicit funds for or pay an assessment or make a contribution to a po­
     litical organization or candidate, attend political gatherings or purchase tick­
     ets for political party dinners or other functions;
   (2) A judge should resign his office when he becomes a candidate either in a
primary or in a general election for any office;
   (8) A judge should not engage in any other political activity; provided, how­
ever, this should not prevent a judge from engaging in the activities described
in Canon 4.
  Judge Tuttle advised the Conference that its views had been
sought by appropriate committees of the Congress on four bills
dealing generally with judicial ethics, as follows:
   liR. 95, a bill "to provide a code of ethics for federal judges, including Supreme
{)()urt Justices, by amending chapter 11 of title 18, United States O>de";
                                        53 

  H.R. 4721, II bill "to amend title 28, United States Code, to prohibit federal
judges from receiving compensation other than for the performance of their
judicial duties, except in certain instances, and to provide for the disclosure of
certain financial information";
  H.R. 1868, a bill "requiring personal financial disclosure, and promoting pnblic
confidence in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the Government
of the United States";
  H.R. 606, a bill "to require judges of courts of the United States to :file confi­
dential financial statements with the Oomptroller General of the United States,
and for other purposes."
  The Conference agreed, aside from what may be a basic violation
of the doctrine of the separation of powers, that it had already
through the adoption and implementation of various resolutions
and the formal adoption of a Code of Judicial Conduct effectively
acted in substantially all areas that are the subject matter of the
proposed bills and, consequently, voted its disapproval of each bill.
  Judge Tuttle requested the Conference and received its authority
to have the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts prepare and issue to all judges, referees in bankruptcy
and magistrates in looseleaf binder form a volume to be entitled
"Code of Judicial Conduct for United States Judges" which will
contain the Code as adopted by the Conference at its April 1973
meeting and Canon 7 as approved at this meeting. This volume
will contain in a well-indexed and cross-indexed form all of the
materials included in the report of the Joint Committee as finally
adopted by the Conference, together with such formal numbered
opinions as have been promulgated by the Advisory Committee on
Judicial Activities as may still be applicable.
  ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES
   Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman of the Advisory Committee
on Judicial Activities, presented the report of the Committee.
   Judge Tuttle reported that no formal opinions had been issued
since the April session of the Conference. He advised, however, that
the Committee had authorized him to call to the attention of all
judges the modifications which Canon 3-D of the Code of Judicial
Conduct adopted by the Conference in April 1973 had made in
the procedure recommended by Opinion No. 20 of the Advisory
Committee.
 . Opinion No. 20 as originally written required that if a judge or a
member of his family residing in his household owned any stock in
                                  54: 

a corporation which is a party to a case before him, he should notify
all counsel promptly and refuse to participate in the case unless
counsel for all the parties willingly consent that he do so. The adop­
tion of Canon 3-D requires a change in this procedure, namely, that
a judge in a situation such as that set forth in Opinion No. 20 shall
obtain the written consent of the parties as well as of the lawyers.
The Committee construes this to require a written notice to the
clerk for each party and counsel.

   COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on Intercircuit Assignments covering the period from
March 1, 1973, to August 1, 1973.
  During this period the Committee recommended 30 assignments
to be undertaken by 25 judges. Of this number, seven are senior
circuit judges, two are active circuit judges, three are district judges
in active status and ten are senior district judges. One retired
Supreme Court Justice, and one active and one senior judge of the
Customs Court participated in five assignments.
  Seven senior circuit judges, two senior district judges and one
retired Supreme Court Justice carried out 12 of the 14 assignments
to the circuit courts of appeals which were recommended during
this period. Of the 16 assignments to the district courts, nine senior
district judges each carried out one assignment, three active district
judges carried out four assignments, one active judge of the Customs
Court carried out one assignment while a senior judge of the Cus­
toms Court carried out the remaining two assignments.

       COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE 

                 JURy SYSTEM 

  Judge Arthur J. Stanley, Jr., Chairman, presented the Commit­
tee's report.
                           SIZE OF JURIES

  The Judicial Conference on two prior occasions has recommended
legislation to provide for six-person juries in civil trials and to re­
duce the number of peremptory challenges from three to two (Conf.
Rept., April 1972, p. 5; Conf. Rept., April 1973, p. 13). H.R. 8285,
93rd Congress, carries out the recommendation of the Conference as
                                  55 

does S. 2057, 93rd Congress. The Conference after studying both
legislative proposals expressed its preference for S. 2057 because it
included two features not contained in H.R. 8285, namely-(a) a
provision preserving the principle of unanimity unless the parties
stipulate otherwise and (b) a provision authorizing the court to
direct that several parties with similar interests exercise only the
peremptory challenges of a single party.
   The Conference also considered S. 288, 93rd Congress, which pro­
vides for juries of six persons in criminal as well as civil trials and
again expressed the view that reduction in jury size be made only
in the civil area.

                      AUTOMATED   JURY   SELECTION

   Twenty-eight districts are now or soon will be using automated
systems for selecting jurors in accordance with prior recommenda­
tions of the Conference. The Conference noted that two areas of
concern have arisen in relation to the defining of the automated
system-(a) the pUblic drawing requirements of 28 U.S.C. 1864(a)
and 1866(a), and (b) the juror summons form. The Conference
adopted a recommendation of the Committee to propose legislation
to amend the definition section of the Jury Selection and Service
Act to insure the continued proper functioning of the automated
system. The proposed bill would add a new subsection (j) to the
Act so as to define the meaning of the term "publicly draw" to
mean a drawing in a nonsecretive manner. This is necessary because
computer operations of the General Services Administration are
established on a regional basis and the public drawing of names for
jury service must be made at those regional headquarters which in
many cases are outside of the affected district. The proposed defini­
tion would clarify that reasonable public notice of the drawing must
be given in the district whose names are being drawn but the actual
drawing does not have to occur in the district. The proposed defini­
tion would give flexibility so that the Conference can issue govern­
ing regulations.
   The proposed bill would also add a new subsection (k) defining
the juror summons to meet the requirements necessitated by auto­
mated processing. At present juror summonses are commonly sent
without the seal of the court or the clerk's or the jury commis­
sioner's signature on the form because there is no way to add
     523-410-18---4
                                      56 

these features manually without defeating the work-saving ad­
vantages of automation. The proposed new definition would permit
the summons to have a seal affixed by some mechanical method and
to have the clerk's name affixed automatically by some facsimile or
printed method. The Conference authorized the transmission of
these proposals to the Congress.
                PROTECTION OF JUROR'S EMPLOYMENT

   R.R. 10689, 92nd Congress, introduced at the recommendation
of the Judicial Conference, would have provided a criminal penalty
for discharging an employee by reason of his jury service or at­
tendance in connection with such service. At a committee hearing
on this bill several members of the Congress indicated that the
legislation should be drafted with a civil rather than a criminal
penalty. Since the one purpose of the Act is that all citizens have an
unfettered opportunity to be considered for and to perform jury
service when selected, the Conference approved a recommendation
of a draft bill which would provide for injunctive relief and a civil
penalty and directed the Administrative Office to transmit this
proposed legislation to the Congress.
                           JUROR UTILIZATION

   The Conference was advised that overall juror utilization effi­
ciency has been made. The Committee reported to the Conference
that three Florida districts have conducted workshops in recent
months which were highly successful in creating an awareness
of the means of improving juror utilization. The Western District
of Pennsylvania has also conducted a successful workshop and
others are contemplated.
                               REsOLUTION

   The Committee noted that Judge Irving R. Kaufman who had
served as its Chairman since 1966 had at his own request re­
linquished the chairmanship of the Committee by reason of added
duties since elevation to the position of Chief Judge of the Second
Circuit. The Committee reported to the Conference the following
resolution which it had adopted:
  On this, the occasion of the first meeting of the Committee on the Operation
of the Jury System since Judge Irving R. Kaufman relinquished the ehairman­
                                       57 

ship of the Committee, the Committee expresses its high esteem and thanks for
the effective manner in which Judge Kaufman conducted the affairs of the
Committee during his chairmanship.
   During Judge Kaufman's incumbency, and due primarily to his effective
leadership, the Committee exerted a major impact on the improvement of the
federal jury system. The principle of random selection of jurors in a manner
that would produce a fair cross section of the community in the district or
division in which court is held was endorsed by the Judicial Conference. The
"key man" system of federal juror selection with its wide-spread criticism was
brought to an end. Under Judge Kaufman's guidance, the Committee drafted
the landmark law on the federal jury system, which was thereafter enacted by
the Congress as the JurY Selection and Service Act of 1968.
   In the wake of Sheppard v. Maanoen, 384 U.S. 333 (1966), studies of the Com­
mittee led to the adoption of the Judicial Conference's Free Press-Fair Trial
Guidelines. Other studies under Judge Kaufman's leadership resulted in the
automation of jurY selection processes in the larger court centers, guidelines for
the more effective utilization of jurors, but more importantly, an awakening to
the need for more efficient utilization of jurors.
   We, the members of the Committee on the Operation of the JurY System, take
pride in having had a part with Judge Kaufman in the reformation of the federal
jurY system and its preservation as a fundamental institution of democracy.
  The Committee gratefully thanks Judge Kaufman for his dedicated leader­
ship and the inspiration he has imparted to each of us in our endeavors to con­
tinue to improve the federal jurY system.
  This Resolution shall be incorporated in the Minutes of this Committee and in
its report to the Judicial Conference and also shall be transmitted to Judge
Kaufman.

     COMMI'TTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                  JUSTICE ACT 

 The report of the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice
Act was presented by Judge Roszel C. Thomsen, Chairman.
                    ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   The Conference received and authorized the release of the re­
port of the Director of the Administrative Office and noted that for
fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, 56,000 defendants had been as­
signed counsel under the Criminal Justice Act. In the satne period
$3,893,000 was paid to counsel. The report showed that for the first
time the average cost per case handled by a federal publio defender
is less than that of a case assigned to private counse1. The report
of the Administrative Office sho~ that the average cos'f! of a case
assigned to a federal public defender in fiscal year 1973 was $274,
the average cost of an assigned~counsel case was projected at $300
and the average cost of a case handled by a coIiuilunity defender
                                 58 

organization $323. The report also pointed out that in addition to
the cost factor, federal public defenders are performing valuable
services for and on behalf of the courts in coordinating appoint­
ments, in advising and counselling private attorneys and in other
ways not reflected in the statistics. The sum of $17,472,000 was ap­
propriated by the Congress for fiscal year 1973 of which $1,500,000
was for the liquidation of obligations incurred in prior years.

                   FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS

  Judge Thomsen reported that in addition to the eight federal
pUblic defender offices which were operational during fiscal year
1973, three additional public defender offices were opened in Au­
gust 1973, at Cleveland in the Northern District of Ohio, Newark
in the District of New Jersey and Wichita in the District of Kansas.
             CoMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS

   The Conference received and approved a request from the Fed­
eral Defender Program, Inc., a nonprofit defense counselling service
in Atlanta, Ga., designated as a Community Defender Organiza­
tion by the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia. This organization which expects to commence opera- '
tions on January I, 1974, was awarded an initial grant of $25,000
and a sustaining grant for the six-month period commencing Janu­
ary 1, 1974, in the amount of $74,290, with the proviso that any
monies thus granted shall be used only for the purpose stated in
the Criminal Justice Act and for no other purposes and that any
unexpended funds or other assets which may remain in the event
of the dissolution of the corporation shall revert to the United
States government.
   LEGISLATION CoNCERNING DISTRICl' OF COLUMBIA CoURTS

   At the October 1972 session of the Conference, and again at the         1
April 1973 session, the Conference approved a recommendation           (   I
of the Budget Committee that future appropriations for the ap­
pointment of counsel in the local courts of the District of Columbia
should be requested through the District of Columbia appropria­
tions. The same view was expressed by the House of Representa­
tives in 1972 and again in 1973 and the report of the Senate Appro­
priations Committee released September 12, 1973, stated that the
                                      59 

committee strongly concurred with the House that the appropria.
tions for the assigned-counsel program should be provided for in
the District of Columbia budget. In order to complete the intent
 expressed by both the appropriations committees and by the Con­
ference, the Conference approved a legislative proposal for trans­
mittal to the Congress designed to divorce the local courts of the
District of Columbia from the operation of the Criminal Justice
Act and to establish a separate assigned-counsel system for those
courts patterned on the Criminal Justice Act.
   The legislative proposal further recommends that the Public
Defender Agency of the District of Columbia should be assigned
solely to the local courts and should operate under the direction
of the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration in the District
of Columbia established by the District of Columbia Court Re­
organization Act of 1970. This legislation would place the federal
courts in the District of Columbia Circuit in the same position
under the Criminal Justice Act a8 are all other federal courts
throughout the country and would thus permit the federal courts
to operate solely on the assigned-counsel system or adopt for them­
selves one of the public defender options provided by subsection
(h) of the Criminal Justice Act, as amended.
                                GUIDELINES

  In order to deal with the question of the proper statutory maxi·
mum applicable to appointment of counsel for witnesses summoned
to appear before a grand jury, the Conference adopted the follow­
ing guideline:
  When a judge appoints counsel for a witness before a grand jury under the
terms of the Criminal Justice Act in cases in which the witness faces loss of
Uberty, such appointment shall be deemed to be an appointment under the
general terms of the Act rather than under the terms of subsection (g) and that
ordinarily such appointment should be considered to he an appointment in a
misdemeanor case.
  The Conference further directed that in each circuit and district
counsel claiming in excess of $300 for out·of-court work be re­
quired to submit a memorandum detailing how that time was spent.
                        EXCESS PAYMENT CASES

 While chief judges of the circuits have normally required a
memorandum in support of a recommendation by a district judge
                                         60 


for the payment of sums in excess of the statutory maximum, the"
Conference agreed with a recommendation of the Committee that
in every excess payment case the district judge should furnish to
the chief judge of the circuit a memorandum containing his recom­
mendation and a statement of any facts which he believes would
justify approval of the claim in whole or in part.

    COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

              BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM 

 Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System.

             SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

   The Committee reported that it has considered the recommenda­
tions contained in the survey report of the Director of the Admin­
istrative Office, dated June 22, 1973, and the recommendations of
the circuit councils and district judges concerned for the creation
of one additional full-time referee position, for the continuation
of 24 referee positions to become vacant by expiration of term, and
for changes in arrangements in referee service in one district. The

                           JURISDIC1l'ION

  United States district courts, under existing law, may desig;nate
United States magistrates to try and sentence persons accused of
certain minor offenses where the punishment "does not exceed im­
prisonment for a period of one year, or a fine of not more than
$1,000, or both." It was the view of the Committee that there are
a number of misdemeanors in the United States Code not included
in the term "minor offense" which could properly be tried by United
States magistrates. These include the illegal possession of untaxed
alcohol, 26 U.S.C. 5686, and the illegal possession of certain con­
trolled substances, 21 U.S.C. 841 (b). These two offenses carry maxi­
mum penalties not to exceed one year imprisonment or a fine of
not more than $5,000, or both. Upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee the Conference approved a draft bill to amend 18 U.S.C.
3401 to enlarge the trial jurisdiction of United States magistrates
to include misdemeanors where the punishment does not exceed
one year imprisonment or a fine of $5,000, or both.
                             PROBATION

   The Committee reported that it considered and approved a draft
bill, referred to it by the Committee on the Administration of the
Probation System, which would authorize a United States magis­
trate, in any case within his jurisdiction, to place a defendant on
probation prior to trial or prior to the acceptance of a plea of
guilty or nolo contendere. The draft bill is similar to S. 798, 93rd
Congress, which was approved in principle by the Conference at
the April 1973 session (Conf. Rept., p. 25), except that (1) the
range of offenses is limited to those arising within the jurisdiction
of magistrates; (2) the tenn of probation is limited to 18 months;
and (3) in the event probation is revoked, the defendant must be
tried before a judge of the district court or a different magistrate.
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, ap­
proved the draft bill submitted by the Committee.
                   ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, ap­
proved changes in three Regulations of the Director of the Admin­
i8trative Office governing the administration of the magistrates
                                 72 

system. Section 1.21 of the Regulations was amended to eliminate
the necessity for surety bonds in accordance with Public Law
92-310 which makes the government a self-insurer of the faithful
performance of its employees. Section 2.4(a) of the Regulations
was amended to permit the preparation of transcripts of magis­
trate proceedings outside of the magistrate's office by a qualified
individual or transcribing firm and requiring the expense thereof
to be paid by the parties to the litigation. Section 2.7 was amended
to require parties to pay for the actual cost of duplicate copies of
magnetic tapes or recording discs of official proceedings in addition
to the previously prescribed fee of 40 cents for each 15 minutes
of recording.
   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
              PROBATION SYSTEM
  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Pro-­
bation System was presented by Judge Albert C. Wollenberg,
Chairman.
                  JOINT SENTENCING INSTITUTE

  The Conference considered and approved the tentative agenda, (
the time, place and participants of the Joint Sentencing Institute
to be held under the auspices of the Eighth and Tenth Circuits
at Springfield, Mo., on April 22-24, 1974.
       QUALIFICATION STANDARDS FOR PROBATION OFFICERS

  The Judicial Conference at its September 1942 meeting (Conf.
Rept., p. 9) recommended to the various district courts certain
qualification standards for probation officers, among which was a
requirement that the age at the time of appointment should be
between 24 and 45 years, inclusive. The Conference was advised
that such a qualification standard is contrary to public policy ex­
pressed in the Age Discrimination and Employment Act (29 U.S.C.
621-634, and 5 U.S.C. 3307). Accordingly, the Conference agreed
to delete this qualification for employment as a probation officer.
               TRAINING OF PROBATION OFFICERS

  Noting the need for the continuing education and training of
probation officers, the Conference adopted the following resolution:
                                        73 

   Whereas, the Conference notes that one of the statutory responsibilities of the
Federal Judicial Center is "to stimulate, create, develop, and conduct programs
of continuing education and training for personnel of the judicial branch of the
Government" ; and
   Whereas, the Conference is firmly of the opinion that the attendance of proba­
tion officers at training programs sponsored by the Center will improve and en­
hance the skills and techniques employed in the performance of their official
duties; now, therefore, be it
   Re8o~ved, That the judges of the district courts shall make every effort to
insure the attendance of the probation officers of their courts at training programs
when invited by the Center unless the court finds that an emergency situation
precludes such attendance.

                          CARRYING OF FIREARMS

   On recommendation of the Committee the Conference approved
revision of the section of the United States Probation Officers Man­
ual concerning the carrying of firearms so as to provide that fire­
arms may be carried by probation officers only when consistent with
state law and with the express approval of the court and after ap­
propriate training. The Conference instructed the Committee to
study the desirability of a fedeml statute to permit probation
officers to carry firearms.

                                  PERSONNEL

   Judge Wollenberg stated that the Appropriation Bill for the fed­
eral judiciary for fiscal year 1974 then pending in the Senate in­
cludes funds for 340 probation officer and 201 clerical positions.
He reported that the Committee had reviewed in detail a popula­
tion census of persons under supervision conducted by the Proba­
tion Division of the Administrative Office in January 1973 as well
as a time study of the work of probation officers conducted by the
Federal Judicial Center in January and February 1973. He said
further that after review of these studies and the method of projec­
tion of workload and staff requirements, the Committee recom­
mended to the Committee on the Budget that the 1975 budget
request include funds for 320 additional probation officer positions
and 199 clerk-stenographer positions in addition to any of the 340
officer and 201 clerical positions requested for 1974 which might be
disallowed by the Congress. He reported that the Committee ac­
cepted as a minimum standard sufficient staff to provide an average
of one hour per month face-to-face contact between the probation
officer and the person under supervision.

                             LEGISLATION

   S. 2160, a bill to establish a new Criminal Justice Services Admin­
istration in the Department of Justice, was referred to the Confer­
ence for study and report. The provisions of the bill fall within the
jurisdiction of the Probation Committee, the Committee on the
Administration of the Criminal Law and the Habeas Corpus Com­
mittee. Judge Wollenberg reported to the Conference on those
sections of the bill which would transfer the federal probation
system and the functions performed by the system to a new agency,
the Criminal Justice Services Administration within the Depart­
ment of Justice. The Conference agreed to reaffirm its disapproval
of any legislative proposal that would place probation officers or
any functions now performed by the probation system under the
prosecutive agency of the government (Conf. Rept., March 1966,
p.15; March 1967, p. 37; February 1968, p. 30; March 1969, p. 27;
March 1970, p. 28).

             COMMITTEE ON HABEAS CORPUS
   Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman, presented the report of the
Special Committee on Habeas Corpus.
   The Conference considered two bills, S. 567 which would amend
Sections 2253,2254 and 2255 of Title 28, United States Code, and
H.R. 3329 which seeks to amend only federal habeas corpus rights
as applied to state prisoners. While the Conference was agTeed
that there was a need for an overall revision of all habeas corpus
statutes, it voted its disapproval of these two bills in that they
would lead to a proliferation of substantial interpretive litigation
and would be counter-productive in that they would increasingly
overburden the Supreme Court as a petitioner's sole federal relief
would essentially rest in an application for a writ of certiorari to the
highest court of the state. In voting disapproval of these two bills,
the Conference requested the Committee to consider alternative
methods and recommend to the Conference a draft bill designed to
cure the abuses which the courts now find in the present habeas
corpus and related statutes.
  Judge Hoffman advised the Conference that his Committee had
considered its sections of S. 2160 (see above, p. 74) which pur­
ports to establish an Office of Ombudsman headed by a Director
                                75 

empowered to have referred to him a petition for collateral review
of a conviction filed by a federal offender and make recommenda­
tions to the Court. The Conference agreed with the Committee
that no useful purpose could be served in having still another
agency making recommendations in proceedings under 28 U.S.C.
2255 and, accordingly, voted its disapproval of this portion of
S. 2160.
   The Conference instructed the Committee to study further pro­
ceedings under 42 U.S.C.1983 and related statutes affecting prisoner
suits and to make appropriate recommendations to a future session
of the Conference.

  COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
              CRIMINAL LAW
  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law was presented by the Committee Chairman, Judge
Alfonso J. Zirpoli. The report of the Subcommittee on the Study of
the new Criminal Code was presented by Subcommittee Chairman,
Judge Ruggero J. Aldisert.

                  BRIBERY OF STATE OFFICIALS

   The Conference considered two bills, H.R. 676 and H.R. 6736
which, if enacted, would make the bribery of state and local offi­
cials federal crimes. The Conference agreed that the basic issue
presented relates to the wisdom of making a federal offense of
conduct heretofore traditionally treated as a state responsibility
and, accordingly, since this is a policy consideration for the Con­
gress, the Conference made no recommendation.
             PRIORITY IN TRIAL OF      N ARCOTrc   CASES

  The Conference considered S. 1126 which would amend Title
28, United States Code, by adding Section 335 to grant a priority
in the trial or other disposition of any case involving a violation
of the laws of the United States relating to narcotic drugs, mari­
huana or depressant or stimulant substances. The Conferen~
voted its disapproval of S. 1126, noting that the courts are already
overburdened with priority provisions and that the plans adopted
by the district courts pursuant to Rule 50 (b) of the Federal Rules
                                 76 


of Criminal Procedure make adequate provision for priority in the
trial of any case, including the narcotic case which because of spe­
cial circumstances merits an early trial.

                        PAYMENT OF COSTS

   H.R. 5148 provides that when an a.ccused is found not guilty or
if the prosecution is dismissed with prejudice, the court shall order
that the United States pay the costs as taxed under Section 1920 of
Title 18, United States Code. The Conference agreed that whether
to permit a defendant to recover taxable costs is a policy determina­
tion for the Congress but the Conference did agree that the taxing
of such costs should be discretionary rather than mandatory since
in some cases a defendant is found not guilty or his case is dismissed
solely on technical grounds unrelated to his guilt or innocence.

         PROSECUTION FOR CRIMES CoMMITTED ABROAD

  The Conference voted its support of H.R.107, a bill which would
subject certain nationals or citizens of the United States to the
jurisdiction of the United States district courts for their crimes
committed outside the United States and would provide for the
apprehension, restraint, removal and delivery of such persons. The
Conference had previously endorsed a similar bill, H.R. 18857,
91st Congress (Conf. Rept., March 1971, p. 4).

                           SPEEDY TRIAL

  The Conference voted its disapproval of S. 754, a bill relating to
speedy trials and providing for the establishment of pretrial service
agencies. The Conference again noted the plans for the prompt
disposition of criminal cases promulgated under Rule 50(b) of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and expressed the view that
the district courts are now operating under time limits which at
least for the next three years are more restrictive than those pro­
vided in S. 754. The Conference saw no reason for the establish­
ment of a separate system of pretrial service agencies since the
services are essentially those now furnished by probation officers
who by training and experience are eminently qualified to render
such service.
                                  77
           CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEMS

   The Department of Justice submitted for Conference considera­
tion a draft bill cited as the "Criminal Justice Information Systems
Security and Privacy Act of 1973." The Conference in considering
the terms of the bill agreed that there clearly is a need for a speedy
and effective system or systems for the coliection, processing and
dissemination for criminal justice information but expressed the
view that the draft bill should be limited to criminal offender rec­
ord information as provided in the model state act proposed by
Project Search and should not include "criminal intelligence infor­
mation." The Conference agreed further that such information
should be used only for law enforcement purposes or for research
related to law enforcement.

                         THE GRAND JURY

  The Conference considered and voted its disapproval of H.R.
8461, a bill which would effect radical changes in existing grand
jury practices and procedures and would provide for independent
inquiries by grand juries. In presenting the report on this bill to the
Conference, Judge Zirpoli pointed out that the Advisory Committee
on Criminal Rules, under the Chairmanship of Judge J. Edward
Lumbard, is at present conducting a study of certain grand jury
procedures. He said that the two committees have a close working
relationship and that the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules
at its meeting on August 2-3, 1973, had likewise voted disapproval
ofH.R. 8461.
            CRIMINAL JUSTICE REORGANIZATION          ACT
   Judge Zirpoli stated that the Committee on the Administration
of the Criminal Law had considered those sections of S. 2160, a bill
cited as the "Federal Criminal Justice Systems Reorganization
Act," which had not been considered directly by the Habeas Corpus
and Probation Committees. The Committee pointed out that the
legislation would put into one agency some of the basic responsi­
bilities of the prosecutor and the judge and add to them custodial
and release responsibilities. This, in the view of the Committee and
of the Conference, would create more problems than it would re­
solve. The bill would permit the new agency to control the lives of
                                 78 

people who have not been arrested, let alone indicted or convicted.
The Conference agreed that the procedures provided in the bill
would be cumbersome and impracticable and would result in inter­
minable delays in the disposition of criminal cases and a substantial
increase in appellate interpretive litigation.
  The Conference, noting the objections raised by three of its com­
mittees to the provisions of S. 2160, voted its disapproval thereof.
            PROPOSED NEW FEDERAL CRIMINAL CODE

   At the April 1973 session the Conference considered the provi­
sions of the first part of the proposed new Federal Criminal Code
which outlined the basis of federal jurisdiction and prescribed cer­
tain principles of general application (Conf. Rept., p. 15). At its
present session the Conference was concerned with the third part
of the Code dealing with sentences. As to this part of the proposed
Code the Conference took the following actjon :
        1. Voted against the adoption of a mandatory requirement
     that the imposition of a sentence be accompanied by appro­
     priate findings of fact and statement of reasons. It agreed that
     such a requirement would complicate the sentencing process
     and would serve to increase interpretive legislation. The re- t
     quirement appears only in S. 1 and not in the other proposals 'i
     for a new Federal Criminal Code;
        2. The Conference approved the classification of offenses
     proposed in the report of the Brown Commission;
        3. The Conference voted against the adoption of provisions
     for Upper Range Imprisonment for Dangerous Felons;
        4. The Conference recognizing that the determination of
     the amount of fines is clearly a matter for Congressional policy'
     agreed that Sections 2201 and 2202 of S. 1400 represent the
     most practical solutions. Since the present jurisdictional limit
     for magistrates is $1,000 and Section 3281 (k) of S. 1400 adjusts
     the jurisdiction for magistrates, it is most important that this
     section changing the jurisdiction for magistrates be adopted.
     The Conference also voted in favor of Sections 2203 and 2204
     of 8. 1400 on modification and response to nonpayment of
     fines;
        5. On the subject of concurrent sentences, the Conference
     voted in favor of Section 2203 of S. 1400 and Section 3204 of
                                79 


    the Brown Commission report and against adoption of the
    joint sentence provision of Section 1-4A5 of S. 1;
       6. The Conference approved the recommendation also made
    by the Probation Committee that court review of parole deter­
    mination be limited to due process questions only;
       7. The Conference voted against codification of the law
    relating to resentencing, expressing the view that this is a
    Constitutional question which should be left to the courts;
       8. As to disqualification to practice a profession or occupa­
    tion, the Conference agreed with the observation of its Com·
    mittee that there is a possible Constitutional problem inherent
    in any federal statute which disqualifies a person from per­
    forming a profession or occupation which has been authorized
    or licensed by a state;
       9. On review of sentences the Conference agreed that it
    would take no action until it receives the report from the
    Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules which is at present
    circulating to the bench and bar for comment a proposal for
    review of sentences by a panel of district court judges in each
    circuit or district. The Conference agreed to make available
    to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules the observa­
    tion of the Criminal Law Committee on the subject of sentenc­
    ing and at the same time voted its disapproval of S. 716 in its
    present form and agreed to take no further action on the sub­
    ject matter of review of sentences until it had received the
    report of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules.

      COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                  PROCEDURE 

  Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on the Rules
of Practice and Procedure, presented the Committee report.

                      RULES   OF EVIDENCE

  Judge Maris advised the Conference that the proposed Federal
Rules of Evidence prescribed by the Supreme Court on Novem­
ber 20, 1972, were transmitted to the Congress on February 5, 1973.
On March 30, 1973, Public Law 93-12 was enacted directing that
these rules shall have no effect except to the extent and with such
amendments as they may be expressly approved by act of Congress
                                80 

Subsequently, H.R. 5463 has been introduced which consists of a;
Committee Print amended to incorporate the changes proposed by
a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. The Subcom­
mittee requested the views of the Advisory Committee on the
Rules of Evidence no later than July 31,1973. Accordingly, a special
session of the Advisory Committee was called and views were
prepared for submission to the Subcommittee prior to the requested
date. On authorization of the Chief Justice and believing that the
Judicial Conference would wish to cooperate, the Committee's
views were transmitted to the House Subcommittee with the ex­
plicit understanding that they constitute only a working paper
which had not received Conference approval.
  The Conference considered the views submitted by the Advisory
Committee on the Rules of Evidence and approved by the standing
Committee and voted its approval thereof.

                       BANKRUPTCY RULEs

   Judge Maris reported that the Bankruptcy Rules and official
forms covering Chapters I-VII and Chapter XIII were approved
and prescribed by the Supreme Court by order of April 24, 1973.
Since the Congress has taken no adverse action, these rules and(
forms will become effective October 1, 1973.
   Judge Marif; then presented for Conference consideration pro­
posed rules and official forms for Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy
Act relating to Arrangements. The Conference approved these pro­
posed rules and forms for Chapter XI and approved the transmittal
of them to the Supreme Court, with a recommendation that they
be approved and prescribed for use in Chapter XI proceedings if
possible by July 1, 1974.
   Judge Maris advised the Conference that the Advisory Commit­
tee hopes by December to complete its consideration of the rules
and forms under Chapter X (Corporate Reorganization) and early
in 1974 the drafts on Chapter IX (Composition of Indebtedness of
Local Taxing Agencies) and Chapter XII (Real Property Arrange­
ments). The latter has already received preliminary consideration
and approved for distribution to the bench and bar for comments.
Work has also started on the last set of rules required under the
Bankruptcy Act, namely, those covering railroad reorganization
proceedings under Chapter VIII, section 77 of the Act.
                                 81
                         CRIMIN AL RULES

  Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Criminal
Rules has circulated, with standing Committee approval, drafts of
amendments to Criminal Rules 6, 11, 23, 24, 35, 41 and 43, new
Criminal Rule 40.1, rules governing habeas corpus proceedings,
rules governing Section 2255 proceedings and an amendmen t to
Appellate Rule 4. Comments are due by February 1, 1974.
  The Advisory Committee is also studying suggestions with re­
spect to the operation and use of the grand jury and to the legal
problems connected therewith.

                    CORRECTIVE AMENDMENTS

   On behalf of the Committee, Judge Maris proposed three correc­
tive amendments, as follows:
      1. O/ficialBankruptcy Form No. 7
         In Official Form No.7 which was forwarded by the Confer­
     ence to the Supreme Court with the Bankruptcy Rules and
      other official forms on January 10, 1973, and which was pre­
     scribed by the Court on April 24, 1973, a portion of subdivisions
     14 and 15 was inadvertently omitted. The Conference ap­
     proved the submission to the Supreme Court of an amendment
     to correct this omission.
     2. Criminal Rule 41 (a)
        In the amendment of Subdivision (a) of Rule 41, Federal
     Rules of Criminal Procedure, prescribed by the Court on
     April 24, 1972, the words "court of record" were inadvertently
     omitted and the Conference approved an amendment to re­
     store these words.
     3. Criminal Rule 60
        An amendment of Rule 50 to add Subdivision (b) was pre­
     scribed by the Supreme Court on April 24, 1972. Inadvertently
     the previously existing single paragraph of the rule was not
     amended to add the designating letter H(a)" and the title
     "Calendars" to distinguish it from the new Subdivision (b).
    The Conference approved for transmission to the Supreme
    Court an amendment to accomplish this result.
                                 82 

PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS
   The Conference approved the pretermission of terms of courts of      «
appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, for those sessions of the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to be held outside of New Orleans
during the court year 1973-1974 and for those sessions of the Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to be held outside of St. Louis,
Missouri, during the court year 1973-1974.

           RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
   The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
on matters considered at this session where necessary for legislative
or administrative action.
