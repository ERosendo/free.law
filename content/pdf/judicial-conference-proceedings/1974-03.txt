THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, 28 U.S.C. 331

§ 331. JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES
    The Chief Justice of the United States shall summon annually the chief judge
 of each judicial circuit, the chief judge of the Court of Claims, the chief judge of
 the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and a district judge from each judicial

 designate. He shall preside at such conference which shall be known as the
 Judicial Conference of the United States. Special sessions of the conference may
 be called by the Chief Justice at such times and places as he may designate.
   The district judge to be summoned from each judicial circuit shall be chosen
 by the circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual judicial conference
 of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 Of this title and shall serve as a mem­
 ber of the conference for three successive years, except that in the year follow­
 ing the enactment of this amended section the judges in the first, fourth, seventh,
 and tenth circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for one year, the judges
 in the second, fifth, and eighth circuIts Shall choose a district judge to serve for
 two years and the judges in the third, sixth, ninth, and District of Columbia
circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for three years.
   If the chief judge of any circuit or the district judge chosen by the judges
of the circuit is unable to attend, the Chief Justice may summon any other cir­
cuit or district judge from such circuit If the chief judge of the Court of
Claims or the chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is unable
to attend, the Chief Justice may summon an associate judge of such court.
Every judge summoned shall attend and, unless excused by the Chief Justice,

needs of his circuit or court and as to any matters in respect of which the admin­
istration of justice in the courts of the United States may be improved.

in the courts of the United States and prepare plans for assignment of judges
to or from circuits or districts where necessary, and shall submit suggestions
to the various courts, in the interest of uniformity and expedition of business.
   The conference shall also carryon a continuous study of the operation and
effect of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as
prescribed by the Supreme Court for the other courts of the United States pur­
suant to law. Such changes in and additions to those rules as the conference may
deem desirable to promote simpUcity in procedure, fairness in administration,
the just determination o:(litigation, and the elhnfnation of unjustifiable expense
and delay shall be recommended by the conference from time to time to the
Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modification or rejection, in
accordance with law.

conference on matters relating to the business of the several courts of the United

of the Judicial Conference and its recommendations for legislation.

ference approved the nomination of Mr. John W. Macy for a
second term as a member of the Board of Certification for Circuit
Executives, commencing July 1, 1974.
REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   The Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Kirks, advised
the Conference concerning the trends in case filings during the first
half of fiscal year 1974. In this period filings in the courts of appeals
have increased 11 percent. In the district courts the civil filings
have increased 2.9 percent and criminal filings have decreased by
7.8 percent.
   Mr. Kirks also advised the Conference on the steps which the
Administrative Office has been taking in collaboration with other
governmental agencies concerning the fuel crisis, especially as it
affects probation officers who are dependent on automobile trans­
portation to fulfill their missions and upon jurors.
               COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
  Judge Carl A. Weinman, Chairman of the Budget Committee,
briefed the Conference concerning the recently concluded hearings
before the Subcommittee on Appropriations of the House of Repre­
sentatives. He noted that the two large increases requested of the
Congress in this budget are for additional probation officers and for
deputy clerks, especially in the district courts. He said that the
budget for the first time contains a request for rental of space for
the judiciary, in accordance with the requirements of Public Law
92-313.
                  COURT ADMINISTRATION
  Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on Court Administration.
                      ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  The Conference agreed with the recommendation of the Com­
mittee to approve on an emergency basis legislation (1) to create
an additional district judgeship for the District of Puerto Rico and
(2) to create two additional judgeships for the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit. The Administrative Office was instructed
     536-895-74-2
                                    4


to submit appropriate legislation and recommendation to the Con­
gress on behalf of the Conference.
Puerto Rico
   The district is at present served by three judges. In the past
six years the district's filings have increased 65.7 percent. The
workload per judgeship of 484 cases remains considerably above
the national average of 352, and the weighted filings of 451 are
greatly in excess of the national average of 343. In fiscal year 1973
the district terminated 423 cases per judgeship, a figure consider­
ably higher than the national average of 354. Nevertheless, pend­
ing cases per judgeship increased from 627 in fiscal year 1972 to
688 in fiscal year 1973. The median time from issue to trial of civil
cases is 21 months. Three years ago it was only 12 months. The
number of three-year old civil cases has risen from 36 in 1967 to
272 at the end of fiscal year 1973. Triable defendants in cases over
one year old number 70. In contrast, there is a total of only 50
such defendants in the four other districts of the First Circuit.
   The district received 109 days assistance from visiting judges in
fiscal year 1973. This was offset, however, by a five-month vacancy
that was filled in December 1972. Whether the relatively large
contribution from visiting judges can, or should be, maintained is
problematical, but it is obvious that without this help in the past
year the backlog would have been measurably larger.
    Chief Judge Toledo has explained that among the problems
 peculiar to Puerto Rico is a local anti-injunction statute, which has
 the effect of attracting petitions for this relief to the federal court.
 He recently advised that as of early December 1973, 98 applica­
 tions for injunctions had been filed during the calendar year.
 Cases of this type, he explained, are usually complicated, requir­
 ing from three to four days of a judge's time for each case.
    The Conference agreed with the Committee that consideration
 of Puerto Rico's needs cannot be based on bare statistics alone.
 Puerto Rico occupies a sensitive position in the federal judicial
 system. The importance of this fact is emphasized by the comments
 of Chief Judge Frank M. Coffin:
    The unique importance of not shortchanging this district lies in the
    special relationship of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the con­
    tinuing tensions revolving about that relationShip, and the need for
    providing to that important, complex, and growing jurisdiction prompt
    access to an e1l'ective and responsive federal court.
                                  5

Ninth Circuit
   As a result of the last quadrennial survey of the courts of appeals,
the Judicial Conference in 1971 recommended to the Congress the
creation of two additional judgeships in the Ninth Circuit, bringing
the total of judgeship positions in the court of appeals to 15. (Conf.
Rept., p. 81). Since 1971 new filings in this circuit have increased
from 1,585 in fiscal year 1970 to 2,316 in fiscal year 1973, or 46.1
percent. Filings in the calendar year 1973 totaled 2,712. The ap­
peals filed per judgeship were 178 and the appeals terminated 165,
as compared with 122 and 117, respectively, in fiscal year 1970. The
judges of the court of appeals have urged that separate legislation
be sponsored on an emergency basis to meet what they regard as a
crisis situation.
                       QUADRENNIAL SURVEY

   Under Conference policy of conducting a survey each four years
of the courts of appeals, such a survey would normally be con­
ducted in 1974. Although the Congress has taken no action on the
recommendations made after the last such survey in 1970, partially
because Congress is awaiting the results of the report of the Com­
mission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, the
Conference agreed with the Committee that a survey should be
undertaken in 1974 and that the results of such a survey might be
helpful in connection with Congressional consideration of the
Commission report, as well as the earlier Conference recommenda­
tions (Conf. Rept.1971, p. 81).

                 BILINGUAL COURT PROCEEDINGS

   The Conference next considered the provisions of S. 1724, intro­
duced September 28, 1973, and referred to the Conference for
comment by the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
This legislative proposal, which is a rather drastic amendment to
a bill previously introduced on the same subject which would have
required the designation of several district courts as "bilingual" and
which would have provided for use of extensive audio electronic
equipment to provide simultaneous translations, provides that in
criminal cases the judge shall order an oral simultaneous transla­
tion of the proceedings or the testimony and that in civil actions the
courts shall order an oral translation of the proceedings, either
simultaneous, consecutive or summary in nature. The bill further
provides that the judge in any proceeding may order all or part of
                                   6

the non-English testimony and translations thereof to be recorded
electronically for use in verification of the official transcript of the
proceedings.
   The Director of the Administrative Office is required to maintain
lists of certified interpreters who shall be called upon by the court
when available. The Director is likewise required to determine and
certify the qualifications of persons who may serve as certified in­
terpreters and make lists of such persons available to the district
courts.
   The Conference noted that the Committee's survey of present
requirements of the courts found little, if any, objection to the
present system or need for change. The Conference was advised,
however, that the legislative history, being made through hearings
conducted since the Committee meeting, demonstrated that the
requirement of "oral simultaneous translation of the proceedings
 in criminal cases does not necessarily require the use of any equip­
ment if the defendant is afforded a continuous uninterrupted trans­
lation." Subsequent Senate hearings have likewise demonstrated
that a court under the proposed bill may make its own selection of
an interpreter if an interpreter certified by the Administrative Of·
fice is not readily available.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee as to a proposed
amendment to S. 1724 that permission to use the Spanish language
in the District Court of Puerto Rico is a decision involving Con­
gressional policy but the Conference was agreed that under such
circumstances the use of Spanish must remain discretionary with
the district judge.
   The Conference agreed that the Congress should be advised of
the foregoing and also advised that no demonstrated need for legis­
lation such as S. 1724 has been found in the federal system although
no one questions the need for accurate translation of court pro­
ceedings for those not fluent in the English language.

             EFFICIENCY AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES

   The Conference was advised that the Director of the Administra­
ive Office had invited the attention of the Committee to a prac­
tice which has developed in recent years whereby various courts
have secured outside consultant services with respect to office man­
agement, filing, data processing"and other office routines. As a re­
sult of recommendations made by such consulting services, in some
instances courts have modified the forms then in use which were
                                   7

forms specifically approved by the Judicial Conference or the Ad­
ministrative Office and substituted other forms which have not
been approved. Likewise, in one or more instances courts have modi­
fied reporting procedures to the Administrative Office as a result
of recommendations by such consulting services. Because of the
duplication of effort in some instances and because of the need of
uniformity in reporting forms, the Conference agreed as a matter
of policy (1) that prior coordination should be had with the Admin­
istrative Office before any commitment for a management study is
made, (2) that no government funds should be obligated without
prior authority of the Administrative Office, and (3) that no
changes should be made in any forms approved by the Judicial Con­
ference without prior Conference approval.

               JUDICIAL CoUNCILS OF THE CIRCUITS

   Through the Subcommittee on Federal Jurisdiction the Com­
mittee on Court Administration reviewed the operation of the pro­
visions of Section 332 of Title 28, United States Code, relating to the
powers and responsibilities of the judicial councils of the circuits.
Through a questionnaire the Subcommittee obtained the views of
circuit judges and chief judges of district courts concerning methods
of improving the operation of the judicial councils. The results of
the questionnaire indicated that judges generally saw no need for
additional legislation further expanding or identifying the func­
tions and duties of the circuit councils. The great majority of the
responses indicated that the present statute gives the circuit coun­
cils all the authority they need to "make all necessary orders for
the effective and expeditious administration of the business of
the courts within [their] circuit[s]" and that further clarification
of the statute concerning council functions is a judicial rather than
a legislative responsibility. The Subcommittee of the Committee
therefore recommended to the Committee a proposed statement
of the powers, functions and duties of councils. This proposed state­
ment was again circulated for comment and revisions were made
in the light of those comments. This statement as submitted by
the Committee was approved by the Judicial Conference and the
Director of the Administrative Office was ordered to distribute
copies thereof to all circuit judges and all judges of the district
courts and the Administrative Office was also requested to incor­
porate the statement in any administrative handbook which may
                                         8

be issued as well as any reissue of the judges' Bench Book. The
statement of the powers, duties and functions of circuit councils is
as follows:
     POWERS, FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF CIRCUIT COUNCILS

  1. Section 332(d) of Title 28, United States Code, reads:
  "Each jndicial council shall make all necessary orders for the effective and
expeditious administration of the business of the courts within its circuit. The
district judges shall promptly carry into effect all orders of the judicial council."
  2. The purpose of 28 USC § 332 is to create a "system of decentralization" by
recognizing in each circuit the judicial council as "the operating unit in bringing
about the proper administration of justice." Hearings before a Subcommttee
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 76th Congress, 1st Sess., on S. 188, April 4-5,
1939, at p. 20.
  3. The judicial council "shall make aU necessary orders for the effective and
expeditious administration of the business of the courts within its circuit." 28
USC § 332. It i8 vital tMt the independence of individual members Of the Judi­
ciary to decide case8 'before them and to articulate their views freeZy be not
infringed 'by action 01 a Judicial oounciZ.
   4. "The responsibility of the councils 'for the effective and expeditious admin­
istration of the business of the courts within its circuit' extends not merely to
the business of the conrts in Its technical sense (judicial administration), such
as the handling and dispatching of cases, but also to the business of the judiciary
in its institutional sense (administration of justice), such as the avoiding of any
stigma, disrepute, or other element of loss of public esteem and confidence in
respect to the court system, from the actions of a judge or other person attached
to the courts." Report of the Judicial Conference of the United States on the
Powers and Responsibilities of the Judicial Councils (June 1961).
   5. The chief judge Qf a district court should be informed when matters con­
cerning his district are under consideration and shall pass the information
promptly to the judges of the district.
   6. Refore any action is taken with respect to a particular judge or other person
attached to the courts in the cirCUit, that judge or Qther person should be invited
to present his views to the council after being advised of the nature of the action
which may be taken together with the reasons. Monitoring the substance of
judicial decisions is not a function of the judicial council.
   7. The chief judge of the circuit, as a representative of the council, should
periOdically call a meeting of all the chief judges of the district courts to discuss
with them matters of mutual concern. It is suggested that copies of the minutes
of these meetings be furnished aU active court of appeals and district court judges
in the circuit. The judges of the district coutts should be encouraged to recom­
mend matters for consideration by the circuit council and, where appropriate,
they should be advised what action, if any, is taken on the recommendations.
   8. With respect to the district courts, the circuit council should keep itself
informed on a regular basis as to the following:
       (a) The condition of its docket in terms of the number of cases filed,
     cases terminated, and cases remaining on its docket; cases under decision
     unduly delayed.
       (b) List of prisoners in jail awaiting trial, shQwing date of imprisonment.
                                          9

       (c) The operation of the Rule 50(b), Federal Rules of Criminal Proce­
    dure, plans for expediting the trial and disposition of criminal cases in the
    district courts of the circuits.
       (d) The operation of Criminal Justice Act plans. See 18 USC § 3006A(i).
       (e) The operation of the jury selection plan in the district courts. See 28
    USC § 1863(a).
       (f) The degree to which the district courts are undertaking to make the
    best utilization of jurors. See Guidelines for Improving Juror Utilization in
    the United States District Courts issued by the Federal Judicial Center.
Although the circuit council should rely when possible on statistics available
from the Admiuistrative Office, it may require the district courts to supply this
information by filing reports with the council.
   9. Where it appears that the court of appeals or any district court in the
circuit has a large backlog of cases, the circuit council should take such steps as
may be necessary to relieve the situation, inclUding working with the court in
question in procuring the assignment of judges from other districts and circuits to
that court.
   10. Where it appears that a circuit or district judge has a large backlog of
cases or decisions to be made, the circuit council should take such steps as may
be necessary to relieve the situation after first giving an opportunity to the circuit
judge or the district court to take appropriate action in the case of a district
judge.
   11. When the dIstrIct judges are encountering difficulty in agreeing upon the
adoption of rules and orders dividing the business of the court, the circuit coun­
cil should lend its assistance in resolving the problem. When the district judges
are unable to agree upon the adoption of rules or orders dividing the business of
the court, the circuit council shall make the necessary orders. 28 USC § 187.
   12. Circuit council meetings should be held at least four times a year. Stand­
ing and ad hoc committees may be utilized to reduce the burden on the council as
a whole and persons not members of the council, including district judges,
members of the bar, law professors and laymen, may be appointed to such
committees.
   18. Before the circuit council adopts any general order affecting the operation
of the C01,lrts within its circuit, the judges of the district courts should be afforded
an opportunity to comment. In appropriate cases it will also be desirable to afford
an opportunity for comment to the bar and public groups known to be concerned.
   14. A circuit council may delegate limited power to the chief judge of the court
of appeals to act on its behalf, but such power shall not extend to the adoption of
general rules or to the taking of final action with respect to a particular judge or
other person.
   15. All duties delegated to the circuit executive by the circuit council shall be
 subject to the general supervision of the chief judge of the circuit. When author­
 ized by the circuit council, the chief judge may also delegate specified portions
 of his powers to the circuit executive.
   16. Where any formal order of the circuit council is not complied with, the
 matter may be referred to the Judicial Conference of the United States, or the
 circuit council may take other appropriate action.
                                         10

                   CoURT OF ApPEALS OPINIONS

    At the October 1972 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p.
33) the Conference requested each circuit to develop an opinion
 publication plan by January 1, 1973. At the April 1973 session
 (Conf. Rept., p. 5) the Conference required each circuit to file a
 report on the operation of its plan during calendar year 1973. This
 report shows that during the 11 months ending November 30, 1973
 a total of 4,563 cases was disposed of in the 11 circuits by published
 opinions, 1,478 by unpublished opinions and 2,408 without opinion.
The Conference was advised that these figures indicate that each
 circuit in its own way has definitely embraced the concept of elim­
inating publication and circulation of circuit court opinions. While
 the plans of each circuit generally follow the basic recommenda­
 tions of the report of the Federal Judicial Center to the April 1972
 meeting of the Judicial Conference, each circuit, to a limited extent,
 is experimenting with respect to some phases of its plan. There are
 in effect 11 legal laboratories accumulating experience and amend­
ing their publication plans on the basis of that experience. Because
 the possible rewards of such experimentation are so rich, the Con­
ference agreed that it should not be discontinued until there is
considerably more experience under the diverse circuit plans. The
Conference noted the view of its Committee and its Subcommittee
that further experimentation may well lead to the amendment of
the diverse circuit plans and that eventually a somewhat more or
less common plan might evolve.
    The Conference agreed with the recommendation that so long
as the experimentation period continues, each circuit should file
with the Administrative Office on January 1 of each year a copy of
its current publication plan, together with a narrative report on
the operation of the plan, particularly in those areas where the
plan differs from the plans of some of the other circuits. Included
also should be a statistical summary indicating the operation of
the plan. This information should be made available to the bench,
the bar and the law schools to encourage them to make their contri­
bution to the resolution of this difficult and persistent problem. The
Conference further agreed that the detailed report on the operation
of the circuit opinion publication plans during the first 11 months
of 1973, together with copies of the plans themselves, should be
made available by the Administrative Office to all circuit judges,
law book and periodical publishers, law reviews and to the Com­
                                  13 

mission on the Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System.
Meanwhile, the Committee was instructed that, through its Sub­
committee on Federal Jurisdiction, it should continue its study of
the problem.
  SUPERGRADE CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

   In October 1973 the Subcommittee on Supporting Personnel ap­
proved the suggestion of the Director of the Administrative Office
for the creation within his office of 15 supergrade classifications (9
in addition to the 6 already authorized) and other executive level
changes. The effect would be to upgrade executive levels in order to
retain and to attract the highest ty:pe of personnel which the func­
tions and responsibilities of the office require. There have been no
upgradings in the executive levels of the Administrative Office per­
sonnel since 1958. On the other hand, since that time a massive
number of additional tasks have been imposed upon the office. A
legislative proposal designed to achieve the desired objective was
prepared and submitted to the Rouse Post Office and Civil Service
Committee. On December 13, 1973, the Director of the Administra­
tive Office appeared before that committee in support of the pro­
posed legislation.
   The Conference agreed with Committee ratification and support
of this legislation and the action of the Director and authorized the
Administrative Office to continue its efforts in support of the req­
uisite legislation.
                            LEGISLATION

Clerk's Office-Canal Zone
   The Conference approved S. 2348 which would amend the Canal
Zone Code to transfer the functions of the clerk of the United
States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone with
respect to the issuance and recording of marriage licenses and
related activities to the Civil Affairs Director of the Canal Zone
government. In so doing the Conference recommended that the
bill be amended to provide for the transfer to the Civil Affairs
Director of all the records of marriages previously accumulated and
now in the custody of the clerk of the United States District Court.
Territorial Judge8
              "
  The Conference disapproved R.R. 10872 which would appear
to increase the retirement benefits accruing to certain territorial
judges for their services as territorial judges in prior years when
                                 14 

the salary of that position was less than $20..000 per year. The
Conference agreed that there was an absence of supporting data
on the bill and that it would appear to be primarily a private bill.
Tort Claims
    The Conference agreed that S. 2427, 93rd Congress, which would
provide for civil suits against the United States on tort claims
arising out of the loss, miscarriage or negligent transmission of
letters or postal matter was primarily a matter involving Con­
gressional policy but it urged that the Congress give consideration
to its impact on the federal courts.
Franchise Act
    The Conference agreed that S. 2467, 93rd Congress, to provide
for the regulation of business franchises, to require full disclosure
of the nature of interests in business franchises, to provide for
increased protection in the public interest in the sale and opera­
 tion of business franchises and to provide for fair competition
in negotiations in franchise agreements, was primarily legislation
involving Congressional policy. The Conference agreed, however,
with the expression of view that the Congress should give consid­
eration to the impact of this legislative proposal on the judiciary.
Environmental Court System
    The Conference agreed with the view of the Department of
Justice in its report prepared pursuant to the Congressional man­
date in Section 9 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of October 18, 1972 in strongly recommending that
a separate environmental court system not be established at
this time.
Chief Judgeships
   At the October 1971 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept.,
p. 77) the Conference noted that Section 3 of Public Law 85-593
provided in part that the amendment of Section 136, Title 28,
United States Code, relating to the office of chief judge of the
district would not be effective with respect to any district having
two judges in regular active service so long as the district judge
holding the office of chief judge of any such district on August 5"
1958 continued to hold such a position and agreed that this legis~
lative proviso had outlived its usefulness. At the September 1973
session the Conference reaffirmed this view (Conf. Rept., p. 50).
                                 15 

The Conference once again reexamined this recommendation and
reaffirmed the position taken at the two prior sessions of the
Conference.
                   REVIEW COMMITTEE
  The report of the Review Committee was presented by Judge
Edward A. Tamm, Chairman.
  The report covered the period July 1 through December 31,
1973. Judge Tamm advised that his Committee had reviewed the
Reports of Extra-Judicial Income of 498 judges from a total of
615, the reports of 160 bankruptcy judges from a total of 176
and the reports of 97 United States magistrates from a total of
102 required to file. Several reports were received subsequent to
the time of the Committee meeting and will be examined at the
next meeting of the Committee.
  Judge Tamm pointed out that because of the present schedule
of sessions of the Judicial Conference which have been set to
accommodate the budget cycle, his Committee feels it important
to require that the report forms be filed by the fifteenth day of
the month next following the reporting period. The Conference
agreed to amend the present filing requirements to provide that
the report forms for the first six months of each calendar year
shall be filed with the Review Committee no later than July 15
and the reports for the second six months no later than January 15
immediately following the close of the reporting period.
  In accordance with Conference authorization the Review Com­
mittee referred directly to the Advisory Committee on Judicial
Activities a number of questions which have arisen since the prior
reporting period because of the Conference adoption, with amend­
ments, of the canons of judicial ethics prepared by the American
Bar Association.
   The most frequent problem encountered concerns the definition
of "fiduciary activities" and the adoption by the Conference at
the April 1973 session (Conf. Rept., p. 10) of a modification of
the provisions of the Canons relating to the effective date of com­
pliance in regard to fiduciary relationships. On recommendation
of the Committee the Conference agreed to instruct all judicial
councils to obtain from each judicial officer in its circuit the com­
plete details of each and every estate and trust in which that
officer is serving in a fiduciary capacity and to rule affirmatively
upon the propriety of the continuance of this service. Hereafter,
                                         16 

a judge reporting services of a fiduciary in non-family-related mat­
 ters shall in his report form affirmatively set forth that the judicial
council of his circuit has approved the continuation of this rela­
tionship. Similar recommendations relating to bankruptcy judges
and magistrates were also approved.
   The Conference was advised that one of the opinions requested
of the Advisory Committee, identified as Inquiry No.3, relates
to the ethical propriety of the conduct of federal judges who de­
cline for reasons of conscience or otherwise to file public reports of
extra-judicial income. The Conference agreed to instruct the Re­
view Committee to furnish a copy of the answer to Inquiry No.3
to each non-reporting judge in each required period, together with
an appropriate accompanying letter.
   The judicial officers who have not, as of the convening of the
Judicial Conference on March 7, 1974, filed reports of extra-judicial
income for the period June 1 to December 31,1973, are as follows:

  The foregoing is set forth pursuant to the resolution of the
Judicial Conference at its March 1971 session (Conf. Rept., p. 24),
as subsequently amended to include full-time referees in bank­
ruptcy and magistrates.

   JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE CODE OF JUDICIAL
                  CONDUCT
   The report of the Joint Committee on the Code of Judicial Con­
duct was presented by Judge Elbert P. Tuttle who with Judge
Edward A. Tamm is co-Chairman of the Committee.
   The Joint Committee presented to the Conference for approval
a Manual on the Code of Judicial Conduct as approved by the
Conference at its April and September 1973 sessions. The Con­
ference agreed to the release of the manual as a Conference docu­
ment and authorized the Director of the Administrative Office to
circulate the manual in mimeograph form to all judges, including
bankruptcy judges and magistrates, as soon as possible. The Direc­
tor was also authorized to arrange for the printing of the manual in
permanent looseleaf form and to keep the manual current through
periodic changes.
   In approving the manual, the Conference also approved the fol­
lowing editorial changes in the Code as previously approved:
   L That the commentary following Canon 5C(4) (C) relating to campaign con­
tributions for election to judicial office be deleted:
  2. That the designation of subdivision A, in Canon 7, as approved by the Con­
ference, be deleted. The catchline, however, should be retained:
   3. That any reference in the Code to a referee in bankrnptcy be amended to
read "bankruptcy judge";
   4. That Canon 3(7) be amended to read "a judge Should prohibit broadcasting,
televising, recording or taking photographs in the courtroom and areas immediate
adjacent thereto during sessions of court or recesses between sessions. A.. judge
                                      18 

may authorize the use of electronic or photographic means for the presenta­
tion of evidence or for the perpetuation of a record." The matter stricken from
Canon 3(7), including the Commentary. was referred back to the Committee
for further study.

  ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES
   Judge Tuttle, Chairman, reported that the Advisory Committee
on Judicial Activities had considered nineteen inquiries submitted
by the Review Committee on questions relating to the propriety
of activities which reporting judges have disclosed. Four formal
opinions have been published as a result and are numbered 28,
29, 30 and 31. In addition to formal opinions the Committee
answered informally some twenty inquiries by judges merely by
referring the inquiring judge to the appropriate canon, statute,
Conference resolution or formal opinion.
       COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE 

                  JURY SYSTEM 

  Judge Arthur J. Stanley, Jr., Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on the operation of the Jury System.
                             ENERGY CRISIS

   The Conference was advised that the Committee had given
considerable attention to the problems of the energy shortage in
relation to the selection and summoning of jurors for jury trials.
It was agreed that should the Chief Justice deem it necessary
and desirable, he is authorized to appoint an appropriate com­
mittee or committees of the Conference to consider any problems
arising from the energy crisis which affect the administration of
justice.
                         FEES OF JuRORS

   Judge Stanley reported to the Conference on a study which
his Committee had made of the present fee section of the Jury
Selection and Service Act of 1968, as amended. Based on an analy­
sis of this study, the Conference agreed to recommend to the
Congress legislation which basically will accomplish the following
changes in the fee section:
       (1) The revision of Section 1871(a) to eliminate the refer­
     ence to United States commissioners since this office has been
     abolished;
                                 19 

         (2) Increase in the attendance fee for grand and petit jurors
     from $20 to $30 per day based upon the cost of living increase
     since December 1968 i
         (3) A provision for certification of enhanced attendance
     fees for extended service of both grand and petit jurors. The
     proposal would permit the certifying judge to grant increases
     back to the time when he could first have certified an increase;
         (4) Change the present ten cents per mile provision of
     the statute to permit the Director of the Administrative Office
     to increase travel rates for jurors to parallel any increase in
     the government rate;
        (5) To incorporate a parking allowance subject to the dis­
     cretionary control of the local court;
        (6) A provision to permit the Director of the Administra­
     tive Office to promulgate new regulations governing interim
     travel of jurors so as to make their travel between service
    days less disadvantageous than under present regulations i
        (7) Permission for enhanced travel allowances in Alaska
     and Hawaii where higher costs are frequently incurred by
     jurors;
        (8) Permission to establish a fixed subsistence allowance
    without the necessity of itemization. The Director of the Ad­
    ministrative Office would be given permission to authorize an
    allowance similar to that permitted for supporting court per­
    sonnel. Subsistence for overnight stay would be increased
    initially from $16 to $20;
        (9) Permission for higher subsistence rates in Alaska and
    Hawaii;
       (10) Permission for higher expenditures for the conven­
    ience and comfort of sequestered jurors;
       (11) The Director is authorized to promulgate regulations
    to administer the proposed statute.

                    PETIT JUROR UTILIZATION

   The Conference was advised of various workshop programs in
the Fifth Circuit which were conducted in seminar foI1lUtt with
participation and presentations by the circuit court executive, dis­
trict judges, clerks of court, representatives of the Administrative
Office and the Federal Judicial Center, and a consultant from the
Institute of Judicial Administration. Successful workshops were
also held in the Third Circuit. The Conference was advised that
                                  20 


the 1973 report of the Administrative Office on juror utilization
showed steady improvement in the category of "percentage not
used" and a steady increase in the Cipercentage served" category.
The Conference reaffirmed the need for holding workshop programs
with participation, as possible, by the circuit executives and repre­
sentatives of the Administrative Office, the Federal Judicial Center
and other consultants. The Conference also agreed that the use
of the telephonic answering device in calling off dispensable jurors
be studied closely by each district court in order that the courts
needing the units may be able to implement their use and may in­
clude them in their budget equipment costs.
                     SEQUESTRATION OF JURORS

   The Conference noted the views of the Committee on the need
of advance planning to deal with the problems of the sequestered
jury, especially those which arise during extended trials. The Con­
ference noted a letter and orders from Chief Judge Winston E.
Arnow of the Northern District of Florida detailing his experience
in a recent extended trial, as well as an article published by the fore­
lady of the jury involved, on the subject of sequestration from the
juror's point of view. The Conference authorized the distribution
by the Administrative Office to all district judges of these materials
as well as a subcommittee report by Chief Judge Ray McNichols on
the subject of sequestration.
      JURORS INJURED IN PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES

  The Committee recommended to the Conference a draft bill
which would bring federal grand and petit jurors within the cover­
age of the Federal Employees Compensation Act, by adding a new
section to Title 5 of the United States Code. The Conference agreed
with this recommendation and authorized the Director to transmit
the draft bill to the Congress. In so doing, the Conference noted
that on several occasions the United States Department of Labor
has in the past rejected claims by federal jurors for injury on the
basis that jurors are not defined as employees. Inasmuch as jurors
are performing valuable public service and cannot recover for in­
jury under the Federal Tort Claims Act, except by proving negli­
gence in a government agent, the Conference agreed that further
protection for a juror was necessary.
                                  21

                  ANALYSIS OF PERIODIC REPORTS

  The Conference approved a report of a subcommittee of the
Jury Committee for distribution to all district judges, together
with a complete analysis of jury selection decisions. Included in
this study of master wheels of all district courts is ·an analysis of
the constituency by race and sex.
               AUTOMATION OF SELECTION PROCESS

   The Conference resolved that those districts not now automated
confer with the Administrative Office to determine from appro­
priate state authorities the availability of machine-readable voter
lists and that those districts finding a substantial or feasible amount
of names in machine-readable form consider the benefits of imple­
menting an automated system, either partial or full. It was agreed
that the Administrative Office would aid these courts in every ap­
propriate way to implement their programs.
   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

               CRIMINAL LAW 

  Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.
                    THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE

   The Conference noted that H.R. 10275, 93rd Congress, would
eliminate the exclusionary rule as to evidence obtained in violation
of the Fourth Article of the Amendments to'the Constitution of
the United States and substitute a civil remedy for any person
aggrieved by reason of such violation in the form of damages suf­
fered and punitive damage. The Conference agreed that this legis­
lative proposal on which its views were sought by the Congress re­
lates primarily to policy consideration which should be determined
by the Congress and, accordingly, agreed to make no recommenda­
tion.
  SELECTION OF COUNSEL UNDER THE CruMINAL JUSTICE ACT
  /'


  Judge Zirpoli told the Conference that his Committee had been
requested to examine the question of adequacy of representation
in criminal cases and had suggested that each district court reeval­
                                  22 

uate its plan for the representation of persons financially unable
to obtain counsel under the Criminal Justice Act. The Committee
considered various plans for the selection and rotation of lists of
approved counsel and suggested to the Conference that the Admin­
istrative Office be authorized to distribute to all district courts the
plan adopted in the Northern District of California. It was agreed
that this plan should be distributed for purposes of illustration and
that the entire subject matter be the subject of continuing study
by the appropriate committee of the Conference.

                  NEW FEDERAL CRIMINAL CODE

   The Committee presented to the Conference a detailed analy­
sis and comparison of the texts of the substantive law provisions
of the present Title 18 and H.R. 10047 (the Brown Commission
report), S. 1 (Senator McClellan's bill) and S. 1400 (the Depart­
ment of Justice bill). Because the provisions define substantive
offenses, no recommendations of definitions were made by the
Committee. The Conference authorized the transmittal of the
comparison of the texts of these substantive law provisions to the
Congress and in so doing expressed its appreciation to the Com­
mittee for the detailed work it had accomplished over the past three
sessions of the Conference in relation to the proposals relating to
the revision of the Criminal Code.
            COMMITTEE ON HABEAS CORPUS
   The report of the Committee on Habeas Corpus was submitted
to the Conference by its Chairman, Judge Walter E. Hoffman.
   At the September 1973 session of the Conference the Committee
had presented four alternative drafts of proposed legislation for
the consideration of the Conference. These proposals were designed
to eliminate some of the abuses which are prevalent under existing
statutes and judicial decisions. The Conference at that time in­
structed the Committee (Conf. Rept. p. 75) to consider the matter
further and make a specific recommendation in the form of a
single draft bill. Such a recommendation was presented to the Con­
ference by Judge Hoffman and approved for transmittal to the
Congress. The draft bill is designed to eliminate repetitive petitions,
to avoid piecemeal applications by requiring that all grounds for
relief, subject to certain exceptions, be included in one petition, to
                                         23 


achieve a reasonable degree of finality to criminal sentences, to
stimulate early filings and resolutions of matters, and bring about a
reduction in the number of filings which are wholly frivolous.
   Judge Hoffman advised that his Committee was cooperating
with a committee from the Federal Judicial Center in the study of
problems arising under 42 United States Code 1983 and related
statutes. This is a continuing study which will be made the subject
of a report to a later session of the Conference.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
             BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM
  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Bank­
ruptcy System was given by its Chairman, Judge Edward Weinfeld.

             SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

  The Conference received the Committee report, together with
the recommendations contained in the survey report of the Director
of the Administrative Office, dated January 14,1974, as well as the
recommendations of the circuit councils and the district courts
concerned, for continuation of nine referee positions to become
vacant by expiration of term; for filling of one full-time referee
position at Mobile in the Southern District of Alabama which has
been vacant since June 30, 1973; for continuation of the referee

                           CASE FILINGS AND COSTS

   The Conference was advised that a total of 173,197 cases was filed
in fiscal year 1973, the second consecutive year in which bankruptcy
case filings have declined. It was also noted that consistent with the
two-year cycle in fluctuation of bankruptcy case filings there has
been a six percent increase in filings in the first seven months of
fiscal year 1974. Despite this decrease in filings in fiscal year 1973,
there was an increase of over a million dollars in the amount paid
into the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund over payments for
the prior year. Receipts to the Fund, however, covered only 73 per­
cent of the total costs of the bankruptcy system. The estimated
total for fiscal year 1974 is $20,506,000.
   The Conference was advised of efforts to reduce costs by elimi­
nating unneeded personnel from the staffs of referees' offices and
offices of the clerks of court with consOlidated staffs. The Confer­
ence noted the Committee resolution that it was the responsibility
                                        27 

of the Director to enforce the statute and control the number of
bankruptcy clerical personnel in these offices so that they will be
commensurate with the bankruptcy workload of each district.
   The Conference was also informed of the growing tendency of
the courts to appoint referees in bankruptcy as special masters in
non-bankruptcy related cases and was advised of the legislative his­
tory of the Bankruptcy Act which shows the statutory intent that
referees should not serve in any other capacity other than concili­
ation commissioner or special master under the Act. The Confer­
ence was informed that the Committee is of the view that the
courts might well consider using United States magistrates as spe­
cial masters in these non-bankruptcy matters instead of referees.
   The Conference also noted that the Committee supports the posi­
tion of the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office that
procedural changes which materially affect the staffing require­
ments of bankruptcy offices or require substantial expenditures
from appropriated funds should not be implemented without prior
consultation with the Bankruptcy Division on the financial impli­
cations of such changes.
       REPORTS BY DESIGNATED BANKRUPTCY DEPOSITORIES

    Rule 512(h) of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure requires the
  Director of the Administrative Office, with the approval of the 

. Judicial Conference, to prescribe by regulations the reports to be 

  made by designated depositories for estate funds. Pursuant to this 

  authority, the Conference approved the following regulations:
  1. Banking institutions designated as depositories pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule
512 (a) shall file with the bankruptcy court on a quarterly basis a report showing
the balance on deposit in each bankruptcy estate account as of the date of the
report. The report shall identify each accout as follows:
     John Doe as trustee (or receiver, or disbursing officer, etc.) for the bank­
     ruptcy estate of A.B.C. Company, Case No. 74-222.
  2. Whenever the total of the bankruptcy deposits not covered by FDIC insur­
ance reaches 95 percent of the amount of the bond required by Bankruptcy Rule
512 (b), it shall be the duty of the depository to file a written statement with the
court setting forth the total amount of such deposits not covered and the amount
of the bond.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
            MAGISTRATES SYSTEM
  Judge Charles M. Metzner, Chairman of the Committee on the
Administration of the Federal Magistrates System, presented the
report of the Committee.
                                      28

                             SALARY INCREASES

   The Executive Committee in October 1973 authorized payment
to all part-time magistrates of the 4.77 percent comparability
salary increase recently granted to federal employees generally
(other than those magistrates whose salary is already fixed at the
statutory limit). The increase was put into effect on January 1, 1974.
Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ratified
the action taken by the Executive Committee.

                           MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

   The Committee reported that it had considered the recommenda­
tions of the Director of the Administrative Office and of the district
courts and judicial councils concerned regarding requests for the

proved a change in Section 1.12 of the Regulations of the Director
of the Administrative Office to permit part-time magistrates to
submit their claims for reimbursement of actual and necessary
office expenses to the United States marshals for payment.

                                  LEGISLATION

   The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to prepare and transmit to the Congress appropriate legis­
lation that would consolidate the following four pending bills which
had previously been approved by the Conference:
   (1) H.R. 7661, to make the Juvenile Delinquency Act inapplicable in petty
otrense cases;
   (2) H.R. 10476, to permit the payment of transcript costs for indigent liti·
gants in civil cases where a magistrate serves as special master;

  The Conference also authorized the Director to include the fol­
lowing two measures as part of the consolidated bill:
   (1) a provision, previously approved by the Conference, to permit a full-time
referee in bankruptcy to perform magistrate duties; and
    (a) 	a provision to eliminate the requirement in 28 U.S.C. 633(c) that the

    COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

              PROBATION SYSTEM 

  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Pro­
bation System was presented by the Chairman, Judge Albert C.
Wollenberg.
                      SENTENCING INSTITUTES

   The Conference approved the time, place, participants, and ten­
tative agenda for a Joint Sentencing Institute to be held for the
Fourth and Fifth Circuits at Atlanta, Georgia, on October 28-30,
1974. Tentative plans for this institute had been discussed at the
April and September 1972 sessions (Conf. Rept., pp. 13 and 69).
   The Conference approved the time, place, participants, and ten­
tative agenda for a Sentencing Institute for the Third Circuit on
September 27 and 28, 1974, to be held at Hershey, Pennsylvania,
or in view of the energy crisis at such other place as the Circuit
Council shall designate.

                       CARRYING OF FIREARMS

   At the September 1973 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 73) the Con­
ference approved a revision of the Probation Officers' Manual to
provide that firearms may be carried by probation officers only
when consistent with state law and with the express approval of
the court and after appropriate training. At that session the Con­
ference instructed the Committee to study the desirability of a
federal statute to permit probation officers to carry firearms.
   In its report to the Conference the Committee pointed out the
anomalous situation in which a federal function may depend on
the laws of a particular state rather than on consideration of need.
The Committee reported to the Conference that it is not in favor of
probation officers carrying firearms and would prefer alternate
precautionary measures when probation officers by nature of their
work are exposed to hazardous situations. The Committee is aware,
however, of a limited number of instances where cogent reasons
may require a probation officer to carry firearms. In such instances
the Committee was of the view that the officer should have the pro­
tection of a federal statute against criminal or civil liability. Accord­
ingly, the Committee recommended to the Conference a proposed
statute which would permit the carrying of firearms under regula­
tions prescribed by the Judicial Conference.
                                  31 

   After considerable discussion of this· proposal, during which
members of the Conference expressed grave reservations as to arm­
ing probation officers, the subject was referreq back to the Com­
mittee for further consideration including a draft for Conference
consideration of such regulations as it believes the Conference
should prescribe if such a bill were enacted. The Conference
deferred further consideration of the bill itself until it has the bene­
fit of the proposed regulations.

    MONOGRAPH ON SELECTIVE PRESENTENCE INVESTIGATION 

                               REPORTS 


  The Conference noted that the Committee had approved for
distribution to the judges of the district courts and to all probation
officers a monograph on selective presentence investigation reports
which includes an outline and format for a shorter form presentence
investigation report which will serve jointly the needs of the courts,
the probation officers, the Bureau of Prisons and the Board of
Parole. The monograph which also contains guidelines for deter­
mining types of cases in which such reports are appropriate was
prepared under the direction of a study group chaired by Chief
Judge Edward S. Northrop.

               VOLUNTARY SURRENDER PROCEDURES

   The Conference was also advised that the Committee had en­
dorsed a statement of procedures drawn by the Probation Division,
the Bureau of Prisons, and the United States Marshals Service that
would provide for the voluntary surrender of selected sentenced
offenders to the Bureau of Prisions institutions. Since criminal con­
tempt appeared the only sanction available where a prisoner failed
to surrender as directed, the Committee requested the Administra­
tive Office to draft a legislative proposal which would provide a
penalty in the event of failure to report.

    COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  The report of the Intercircuit Assignment Committee which
covered the period from August 1, 1973 to February 1, 1974, was
submitted by the Chairman, Judge Roy W. Harper.
  During the reporting period the Committee recommended
eighty assignments to be undertaken by fifty-two judges. Of this
number, nine are senior circuit judges, six are active circuit judges,
four are district judges in active status and twenty-seven are senior
district judges. One retired Supreme Court Justice, two active and
two senior judges of the Court of Claims and one senior Customs
Court judge participated in nine assignments.
   Nine senior circuit judges, nine senior district judges, two senior
Court of Claims judges, one senior Customs Court judge and one
retired Supreme Court Justice carried out 36 of the 52 assignments
to the circuit courts of appeals which were recommended during
this period. Of the 36 assignments to the district courts, twenty
senior district judges participated in 31 assignments, the remaining
five being carried out by four active district judges and one Supreme
Court Justice. Also during this period there was one assignment to
the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals performed by an
active circuit judge and one to the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals assigned to an active judge from the Court or- Claims.

    COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                JUSTICE ACT 

 The report of the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice
Act was given by the Chairman, Judge Roszel C. Thomsen.

                 ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   The Conference received the report of the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Office for the first half of fiscal year 1974 and author­
ized its release to all judges. The Conference noted that this report
showed that during the six-month period counsel were appointed
for 23,089 persons, a decline of 8.3 percent over the same period of
the prior year. Private attorneys were appointed to represent 17,­
698 as compared with 20,272 in the first half of fiscal year 1973.
Federal public defenders were assigned to 5,391 as compared with
4,902 in the previous year. The sum of $16,500,000 was appropriated
for the implementation of the act in fiscal year 1974, with a limita­
tion of $1,000,000 for compensation and reimbursement of expenses
of attorneys appointed by the judges of the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals and the Superior Court for the District of
Columbia.
   The Conference was advised that a serious problem has arisen
with regard to deficiency financing for fiscal years 1973 and 1974
in respect to the appointments made by the local courts of the
District of Columbia. The Senate and House conferees had included
                                  33 

within the appropriation for the federal judiciary for fiscal year
1974 the sum of $1,000,000 for these courts with the proviso "that
any subsequent funding for this purpose shall be by the District
of Columbia.." The Chief Justice advised the Conference that he
had received requests from the Chief Judges of the local District
of Columbia courts and a letter from the Mayor requesting the
assistance of the Conference. It was the sense of the Conference
that the Mayor should be advised of the concern of the Conference
over these problems and that failure to provide these funds
promptly for the local courts would reflect adversely upon the entire
criminal justice system within the jurisdiction of Congress. On
motion the Conference resolved that it could take no action to in­
clude cost of compliance with the Criminal Justice Act for the local
courts in the budget for federal courts in view of the explicit congres­
sional mandate in the Senate-House conference report. The Chief
Justice was authorized to advise the Mayor and the Congress that
it was unanimously the sense of the Conference that a deficiency
appropriation should be enacted to meet the obligation, appropri­
ating such funds in whatever manner the Congress sees fit.

                   QUALITY OF REPRESENTATION

   The Conference was advised that the Committee, cognizant of
the criticism made in the recent past of the quality of legal serv­
ices and adequacy in the courts of the nation, had sent a question­
naire to all chief judges of the federal courts designed to elicit
their opinion with respect to the representation being afforded
by approved counsel and defenders operating under the Criminal
Justice Act. Of the 56 chief judges of the district courts who re­
sponded, only one was of the view that counsel operating under
the Criminal Justice Act were not at least as competent and able
as privately retained counsel. Many expressed the view that
assigned counsel under the Act were giving better service than
privately retained counsel. Particularly, satisfaction was expressed
with the services of the federal public defenders and their staffs.
The Committee is continuing its study of the quality of repre­
sentation and is awaiting the results of a current survey being
made by the General Accounting Office and will collaborate further
with the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law,
The Conference noted that the Committee has appointed an
advisory committee consisting of experienced public defenders
                                    34 


who will cooperate with the Committee in the revision of guide­
lines, preparation of manuals and the developing of other methods
of improving the administration of the Act in all districts.

                          EXCESS PAYMENTS

   The Conference was informed that while some chief judges of
circuits have recommended guidelines for approving requests for
compensation above the statutory maximum which a district judge
can allow, the Committee does not believe it is either practical or
wise to establish a rigid formula applicable to all cases. A report
of current practices in the Second and Fifth Circuits has been made
available to circuit chief judges for their information.

                    FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS

   Since the last report of the Conference at the September 1973
session (Conf. Rept., p. 58) two additional public defender agen­
cies have become operational in the Western District of Tennessee
and the Districts of Nevada and the Virgin Islands. Judge Thomsen
advised the Conference that the respective judicial councils have
approved federal public defender offices in the District of Maryland
and the Eastern District of Louisiana.

              COMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS

  The Conference approved sustaining grants for fiscal year 1975
for the following community defender organizations:
   Federal Defender Program, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia __________    $150, 000
   Federal Defender Program, Inc., Chicago, Illinois___________    205, 000
   Legal Aid and Defender Association, Detroit, Michigan_____      288,000
   Community Defender Ol'ganization, Minneapolis, MinnesotR__       31, 850
   Federal Defender Services Unit of the Legal Aid Society of
     New York______________________________________________        700,000
   Defender Association, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania__________      230,000

   Since the conclusion of the Conference a request for an initial
and a sustaining grant was received from the Metropolitan Public
Defender Services, Inc., of Portland, Oregon. An initial grant of
$8,000 and a sustaining grant for fiscal year 1975 of $96,000 was
approved subsequent to the session of the Conference by its Execu­
tive Committee upon prior authorization of the Conference.
                                 35 

                            GUIDELINES

   The Conference approved the guideline permitting all defender
organizations to be given a general authorization to procure expert
and other services as contemplated under subsection (e) of the
Criminal Justice Act, as amended, without specific approval of
the court, with the exception that any payments by any defender
organization in excess of $300 shall be certified and approved by
the court and by the chief judge of the circuit, as required by
18 U.S.C. 3OO6A(e) (3); providing further that total expenditures
for investigative, expert and other services shall not exceed the
budget authorizations.
  The Conference approved a further guideline to permit ap­
pointed counsel to be compensated for the time spent in travel be­
tween his office and the place of imprisonment of the defendant
where such travel takes one hour or more during office hours.

COMMIITEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE

  The report of the Committee on the Rules of Practice and Pro­
cedure was submitted by the Chairman, Judge Roszel C. Thomsen.

                       BANKRUPTCY RULES

   The proposed rules and official forms for Chapter XI of the
Bankruptcy Act relating to Arrangements, approved by the Con­
ference at the September 1973 session, have been transmitted to
the Supreme Court. The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules
has approved for prompt distribution to the standing Committee
the proposed rules and official forms under Chapter X (Corporate
Reorganization). The proposed rules and forms under Chapter XII
(Real Property Arrangements) have been distributed to the bench
and bar for comment with May 1, 1974, set a8 the deadline. The
Advisory Committee, at its February 1974 meeting, completed for
distribution to the bench and bar for comment Chapter IX (Com­
position of Indebtedness of Local Taxing Agencies) and continued
its consideration of the draft of Chapter VIII, Section 77 (Railroad
Reorganization) .
                                 36
                         CRIMINAL RULES

  Judge Thomsen advised that the Advisory Committee on Crim­
inal Rules was scheduled to meet on March 15 to consider the
comments of the bench and bar on proposed amendments to
Criminal Rules 6, 11, 23, 24,35, 41 and 43, new Criminal Rule 40.1,
rules governing habeas corpus procedings, rules governing Section
2255 proceedings and an amendment to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules
of Appellate Procedure.

                           CIVIL RULES

   The Advisory Committee on Civil Rules met on March 3 and 4
and has scheduled to meet again on May 20 to discuss matters re­
lating to Rule 23 (class actions) and other proposed amendments
to the Civil Rules.
                        ApPELLATE RULES

  Since the last session of the Conference, Senior Judge William
H. Hastie was made Chairman of the newly constituted Advisory
Committee on Appellate Rules and twelve members have been
appointed to serve with him. Professor Jo Desha Lucas of the Uni­
versity of Chicago School of Law has been named reporter for this
committee. Prior to its first meeting the advisory committee is
studying the locaJ rules of the several circuits as well as other ma­
terials that have been held awaiting the establishment of this ad­
visory committee.
                      SPECIAL REPORTS
   Judge Oren Harris reported to the Conference on the study he
has made of the proposed amendments to the Judicial Survivors
Annuity Act. These amendments were last approved by the Confer­
ence at the April 1973 session (Conf. Rept., p. 5). He stated that
the next actuarial report on the status of the fund was due in April.
He stated also that with. the passage of time since the Conference
first approved amendments to the Act certain changes in the over­
all approach to amending the Act might be desirable. The Confer­
ence was in agreement and authorized Judge Harris to adopt a
flexible approach in presenting these proposed amendments so as
best to achieve the overall objectives of the amendments.
                                 37 


   The matter of judicial compensation was the subject of extended
discussion and it was resolved that this matter be referred to the
Executive Committee for such action as may be deemed appropri­
ate and to cooperate with the Congress and the committees thereof
in supplying information relevant to the issue; it was further re­
solved that the Chief Justice is authorized to appoint an ad hoc
committee to assist the Executive Committee in this undertaking if
the formation of such a committee is deemed appropriate.

PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS
  The Conference approved the pretermission of terms of courts
of appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, for those sessions of the Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit at Asheville, North Carolina, in
calendar year 1974; for those sessions of the Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit to be held outside of New Orleans during the year
1974 and for those sessions of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit to be held outside of St. Louis, Missouri, and St. Paul, Min­
nesota, during the calendar year 1974.
