                                    ELECTIONS
       The election of the Honorable Walter E. Hoffman, Senior Judge
    of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Vir­
    ginia, by the Board of the Federal Judicial Center to succeed the
    Honorable Alfred P. Murrah as Director of the Federal Judicial
    Center, commencing October 27, was announced. Upon his elec­
    tion to be the next Director of the Center Judge Hoffman sub­
    mitted his resignation as a member of the Board of the Federal
    Judicial Center. Upon nomination of the Executive Committee, the
    Judicial Conference approved the Honorable Alfred A. Arraj, Chief
    Judge of the United States District Court for the District of
    Colorado, to fill the unexpired term of Judge Hoffman.
       The Conference, noting that by operation of statute, Judge
    Alfred P. Murrah completes his term as Director of the Federal
    Judicial Center on October 27, adopted the following resolution:
       The Judicial Conference of the United States affectionately salutes Judge
     Alfred P. Murrah as he completes his term as Director of the Federal Judicial
    Center. Named as successor to Justice Tom C. Clark by the Boord of the Center
     in 1970, Judge Murrah has built upon the foundation established by Justice Clark
     and has brought the Judicial Center to a position of maturity and preeminence
    among the institutions of the nation devoted to the administration of justice.
       Judge Murrah was no stranger to the work and activities of the Center. In his
(   capacity as Chairman of the Judicial Conference Committee on Pretrial Pro­
    cedure, a position which he held for more tllan twenty years, Judge Murrah con­
    ducted seminars for United States judges, undertook studies and developed pro­
    cedures designed to improve the administration of justice throughout the federal
    court system. He was not only instrumental in the passage of the Federal
    Judicial Center Act, but the example of his work was the principal justification
    for its creation.
       Throughout his judicial career of more than 36 years, Judge Murrah has been
    closely associated with the work of this Conference, and has regularly attended
    its sessions for more than a quarter century. He was first a member of the
    Judicial Conference Committee on Pretrial Procedure and became its Chairman
    in 1948. This work led him into the field of protracted litigation. In 1955 he
    became Chairman of the Judicial Conference Study Group on Protracted Litiga­
    tion, in 1961 the Chairman of the Coordinating Committee for MultLple Litiga­
    tion, and in 1968 the Chairman of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.
    Judge lfurrah was a member of the Conference from 1960 to 1970, by virtue of
    his position as the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the
    Tenth Circuit. His judicial career started at age 32 through appointment to the
    bench by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
       To the members of the Conference, and to judges througbout the nation, Judge
    Murrah is known as "lfr. Judicial Administration." He has always been willing
    to sbare the problems of any court or judge and bis helpful advice and counsel

                                      44
nave been a souree of inspiration to all. No judge in the history of the nation
has more firmly secured the friendship and confidence of so many judges.
Although Judge Murrah's activities in forums alOund the country in furthering          f
the administration of justice have been tireless, still he is now and always has
been, essentially a working judge whose legal opinions have become landmarks
in the law.
   In bidding him a fond farewell from his official position as Director of the
Federal Judicial Center to resume his duties in his own circuit and elsewhere,
the Conference looks forward to his continuing enthusiastic support, helpful
advice, and strong encouragement of the work of the Conference and the Judicial
Center. We wish him godspeed and many more long years of work in the vineyards
of justice.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   The Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Rowland F. Kirks,
 presented his annual report to the Conference and was authorized
 to release the report for general circulation pursuant to statute.
   Mr. Kirks stated that filings of all types, except criminal cases,
 had risen during fiscal year endIng June 30, 1974. Cases in the
 courts of appeals rose by 5.2 percent. New filings in civil cases in
 the district courts were up by 5.0 percent and bankruptcy cases
 increased by 9.4 percent. Criminal filings, on the other hand, were
down by 6.3 percent.                                                               (
   In the courts of appeals, Mr. Kirks reported that since June 30,
 1968, the pending caseload has risen more than 73 percent whereas
the number of authorized judges has remained at 97 throughout
this period. Considered on a per judgeship basis, the increases reflect
an average additional workload of 79.8 percent in terms of filings,
87.1 percent in terms of terminations and 73.5 percent in terms of
pending caaes. Of the total appeals rising from district courts in the
courts of appeals, approximately 70 percent were civil cases, due
in large measure to an increase in cases involving real property
actions, civil rights and prisoner petitions.
   The report shows that the overall civil and criminal dockets in
the district courts moved upward in 1974 by .3.3 percent, due
entirely to the increase in civil filings. Terminations in civil cases
dropped by 0.6 percent and the median time interval for civil cases
closed (excepting land condemnation cases) was down by one
month, reflecting an overall median of nine months. The decline
in criminal cases, Mr. Kirks stated, can be attributed in large meas­

                                                                                   !
                                                                                   "
                                      45 

    ure to the continuing reduction in selective service cases. Also,
    there was a drop in filings in immigration and liquor law cases, as
    well as drug law violations, many of which are now handled by the
    states or by United States magistrates. The magistrates in fiscal
    year 1974 disposed of 82,705 minor offense cases and handled initial
    proceedings in criminal felony cases in 100,152 proceedings.
      The report states that every judicial district registered increases
    in total filings in bankruptcy. In the past fiscal year 20,746 business
    bankruptcies were filed, setting an all-time record since com­
    parable statistical data were maintained beginning in 1940. The
    highest percentage of these was in the Northeastern section of the
    country and was filed in the second half of the fiscal year.
       Mr. Kirks also pointed to the continued improvement in the
    utilization of jurors in the entire federal system. For the past three
    years there has been a decrease of 18 percent in the juror usage
    index and the percentage of prospective jurors selected for, or who
    have served on, jury trials has continued to increase. Mr. Kirks
    estimated that a total of 270,574 juror days have been saved since
    1971, resulting in an estimated savings in juror attendance fees
    of more than five million dollars.
(                  COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
       The report of the Committee on the Budget was presented by
    its Chairman, Judge Carl Weinman.
       Judge Weinman stated that the cost of operations of the federal
    judiciary during fiscal year 1974 was $200,640,786, leaving an
    unobligated balance of $5,677,214 to be returned to the Treasury.
    Substantial savings were realized by reason of delay in the enact­
    ment of the appropriation bill as well as a very large saving in the
    appropriation for "fees of jurors" due in large measure to the use
    of six-member juries in civil cases and improvements in the man­
    agementand utilization of jurors.
       Judge Weinman stated that the appropriation bill for fiscal year
    1975 was at the time of the Conference before the Senate-House
    conference committee to reconcile the differences between the bills
    passed in each House of Congress. He said that the House bill
    approved six additional deputy clerks for the courts of appeals and
    59 deputy clerks for the district courts, as well as 39 new positions
                                  46 

 in the Administrative Office, including ten fDr the establishment Df
 an Office of Judicial Examinations. The Senate bill approved an
 additienal $22,000 fDr two pool secret3Jries for the Eighth Circuit
 and alsD included a prDvisD in the text Df the bill tD permit the
 appointment of a seniDr law clerk in each circuit at a salary not tD
 exceed $30,000 per annum. Although no funds were prDvided for
 these senior law clerks, the Conference adDpted a reselution approv­
 ing the cencept ef a seniDr staff law clerk in every court of appeals
 and directed its SubcDmmittee en Supporting Personnel to develep
 standards and positien classificatiens for these positions based upon
 age and experience and te repert thereDn tD the Conference at its
 next session.
   Judge Weinman then presented tD the Conference the Com­
 mittee's recDmmendatiens fer budget estimates fer fiscal year 1976
 and the Cenference agreed thereto, !mbject te the proviso that if
 any actien was taken at the September sessiDn which wDuld increase
 the budgetary requirements the estimates were to be adjusted
 accerdingly. The tota,l estimate fer fiscal year 1976 was $313.­
 218,000. The largest item Df increase is in the estimate fDr salaries
Df supperting personnel, including requests fDr nine deputy circuit
 executives, nine senior law clerks fer the courts Df appeals, 24
deputy clerks fDr the district CDurts and 155 additiDnal probation
officers. The Cenference appreved the sum Df $16,531,000 fer the
representation ef court-appeinted counsel and the DperatiDn of the
defender Drganizatiens established under the Criminal Justice Act,
an increase Df $705,000 Dver the adjusted apprDpriatiDn fDr 1975.
   Judge Weinman pointed Dut to the CDnference that in July 1974
the CDngress passed, and the President approved, Public Law
93-344, the so-called CDngressiDnal Budget and Impoundment
CDntrDl Act Df 1974. AmDng Dther things the Act establishes a new
fiscal year tD CDmmence October 1, 1976 and annually thereafter
Dn October 1. It prDvides a new timetable for the presentatiDn and
review of the federa.l budget. Because Df the potential impact Df
this legislatiDn Dn the judiciary and the pDssible effect Dn the
scheduling Df committee meetings and the sessions Df the CDnfer­
ence, the Chief Justice was authorized. if he so desired, to appoint
an ad hoc committee to consider changes in the present timetable
of meetings.

                      COURT ADMINISTRATION
      The report of the Committee on Court Administration was pre­
    sented by its Chairman, Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr.

                 REPRESENTATION OF JUDICIAL OFFICERS

        The Conference was advised that in recent years there has been
     an acute proliferation of suits filed against judicial officers by
    reason of the performance of their official duties. Such suits have
    been filed not only against judges but against clerks of court, mag­
     istrates; referees in bankruptcy and officers of the Administrative
    Office of the United States Courts. Those cases in the nature of
    mandamus brought against a judge seeking to direct him to take
    or to refrain from taking certain action are not considered to pre­
    sent a great problem but those cases filed by disgruntled litigants
     or others which frequently may be '\"ithout merit nevertheless
    require that the judicial officer appear, make answer and defend.
    While the Department of Justice normally represents a judicial
    officer in such litigation, there have been several occasions in the
    recent past where it has not appeared to be appropriate to have
    representation by the Department of Justice. Accordingly, the
    Conference considered and directed the Administrative Office to
    forward to the Congress a proposed bill which would add a new
    section 451 to Chapter 21 of Title 28 United States Code to pro­
    vide that when a judicial officer is sued in his official capacity or
    is otherwise required to defend his alleged official acts or omissions
    and when the services of an a,ttorney for the government are not
    reasonably and appropriately available for his representation pur­
    suant to Section 516 and Section 547 of Title 28, the Director of
    the Administrative Office is authorized to pay the costs of his
    defense in such amounts and under such regulations as may be
    approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States.

                   JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT

       The Conference received a written report from Judge Oren
    Harris, who had previously been requested by the Conference to
    work with the Administrative Office and the Congress in connec­
    tion with the proposed amendments to the Judicial Survivors
    Annuity Act. The Conference requested .Judge Harris to continue
(
                                        48 

 in this capacity and also to work with the Subcommittee on Judi­
 cial Improvements of the Committee on Court Administration in
 its consideration of amendments to the Act. The Conference
 also referred to the Subcommittee for further study a recommenda­
 tion of the Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit which would permit
 a widow of a judge who is receiving benefits under the Act to con­
 tinue to receive such benefits in the event of remarriage.

                         ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  The Conference received the report of the quadrennial survey
of the courts of appeals made in 1974 by the Subcommittee on
Judicial Statistics. As a result of the survey, the Conference
approved the recommendation to the Congress to create the fol­
lowing circuit judgeships.

   In connection with the recommendations relating to the Fifth
 and Ninth Circuits, the Conference did not indicate any position
on proposals relating to realignment of these circuits but did indi­
cate the urgent need for the allocation of additional judgeships to
the geographical area now represented by the Ninth Circuit. No
reCommendation was made as to the Fifth Circuit since its Circuit
Council does not desire to go beyond the present level of 15 for
that circuit so long as it is not divided.
   The recommendations, approved as a result of the 1974 quad­
rennial survey, differ from those made in the last quadrennial sur­
veyand contained in proposed legislation pending in the Congress
in that the last survey made no recommendation as to the District
of Columbia Circuit whereas the circuit council now requests three
new judgeships. The Conference was agreed that until the workload
                                        49
of the circuit stabilizes following the recent court reorganization,
                                                                                     II
no accurate evaluation of workload is feasible.
   The Conference noted that while statistically the Second Circuit
would be entitled to additional judges, the circuit council believes
it can operate most efficiently with nine judges. The Conference
agreed on the need for an additional judgeship for the Eighth
Circuit and for five additional judgeships for the area now served
by the Ninth Circuit.

              STATISTICS ON FUGITIVE CRIMINAL CASES

   The Conference agreed with a recommendation of the Committee
that standardized procedures are now needed to provide a better
means of managing the active docket and of compiling statistics
that accurately reflect a court's work while meeting the requirement
of Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Accord­
ingly, the Conference agreed on a local rule for establishing a
statistically inactive criminal suspense docket as follows:
   A. 	There shall be established a special docket entitled: 

     "Inactive Criminal Suspense Docket" (or other similar name) 

   B. The cases to be placed on this docket are those that in respect to one or
more defendants:
        (1) for reasons beyond the control of the United States attorney cannot
     be further prosecuted or tried for an indefinite period and
        (2) for good reasons should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution
     under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 48.
   C. Each case meeting these requirements shall be transferred to the Inactive
Criminal Suspense Docket until the court orders otherwise in writing upon motion
of any party or on its own motion.
   D. The removal of any case to the Inactive Criminal Suspense Docket with
respect to one or more defendants in no way affects the prosecution of the case
as to other defendants unless the United States Attorney certifies that a trial
is not feasible under the circumstances. In that event, upon order of the court,
the entire case shall be transferred to the Inactive Criminal Suspense Docket,
to the extent the transfer is compatible with the requirements of Rule 5O(h),
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
  E. Removal of a case transferred to the Inactive Criminal Suspense Docket
in no way affects the final prosecution of the case since on its motion the United
States Attorney may reop€n the case.
  F. The clerk shall furnish the chief judge at least once every three months
(beginning June 30, 1974 and thereafter on September 30, December 31, March 31,
and June 30) a list of all cases transferred to the Inactive Criminal Suspense
Docket with one copy submitted to the Division of Information Systems, Adminis­
trative Office of the United States Courts, and one copy to the United States
Attorney. The list Is to contain the docket and defendant number and name of
the defendant, the reason for being placed on the Inactive CrimInal Suspense
Docket. and the date of placement on the Inactive Criminal Suspense Docket.
For those removed, the date of removal and reason is to be provided.
                                       50 

  G, The chief judge, or his designate, shall consult with the United States
Attorney, or the Attorney General annually or more often to ascertain whether
defendants in ca,ses transferred to the Inactive Criminal Suspense Docket should
be returned to the active docket or dismissed from the Inactive Criminal Suspense
Docket.
                           CnrrL DocKm' PACKAGE

  The Conference was advised that an experimental civil docket
package developed by the Administrative Office has been in use in
11 district courts, along with a companion form JS 44, This docket
package is designed to reduce the clerical effort required to initiate
the docket sheet and the JS 5 and JS 6 statistical reports for each
case and, in addition, removes the burden of searching the com­
plaint for the issue involved from the filing clerk to the attorney.
This information is necessary, of course, for the placement of the
case into the appropriate statistical nature of suit category. In view
of the excellent test results and the comments from the users of the
experimental form, the Committee recommended and the Confer­
ence approved the extension of the new civil docket sheet to all
district courts by January 1, 1975 in accordance with Rule 79(a) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
                         SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

Special Legal Staff for Ninth Circuit
   The Conference took note of the rapid increase in case filings
in the last ten years in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
and the report of that court which indicates that it is constantly
falling behind in trying to cope with the increase in filings. The
Conference deliberated at length as to the best way of coping with
this problem in the geographical area now served by the Ninth
Circuit and agreed that the primary need was for more judge­
power. The Conference agreed further that, so long as the number
of judgeships remains as it now is, it would approve the request of
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for 13 additional staff
attorneys and five secretaries to assist the present staff which has
been operating as a screening panel for the court. The Conference
agreed to place the request for these positions in the 1976 budget
estimates with the proviso that the positions are to be filled pursu­
ant to the actual state of demonstrated need at the relevant time.

      Staff Law Clerks-Fourth Circuit
         The Conference approved the request of the Chief Judge for the
      Fourth Circuit to include in the 1976 budget request two staff law
                                                                                            I

        The Conference approved an increase in maximum transcript
      rates of court reporters as follows:
        1. DIMl1l copy from the present rate of $2.00 per page for the original to $2.50,
      the fiat rate of $.50 per page for each copy after the original to remain
      unchanged.
        2. Ordinar1l copy from the present rate of $1.00 per page for the original to
      $1.'25, with a fiat rate of $.50 per • age for each copy after the original.
                                                                                            I
      Court Reporters' Salaries
        The Conference agreed to grant salary increases to those official
      court reporters eligible to receive the increases under the new plan
      of qualifications and compensation for official court reporters in
      the district courts (see Coni. Rept. March 1971, p. 27). Based on
      the current status of the 1975 appropriation bill, the increases
{ .   will be limited to five percent of base salary although funds for a
      ten percent increase were requested and the Administrative Office
      will continue to pursue this request.
      Clerks' Offices-Court of Appeals
         In accordance with guidelines previously established, the Con­

      ference directed the Director of the Administrative Office to in­

      clude in the fiscal year 1976 budget a sufficient number of deputy 

      clerks for the courts of appeals which would adjust the ratio of 

      deputy clerks to the filings projected for fiscal year 1976 to 1 to 75, 

      and to meet any other justifiable needs according to the equities 

      thereof. Any additional positions authorized for fiscal year 1975 

      are to be deducted from this number on a court-by-court basis. 


      Clerks' Offices-District Courts
         In accordance with previously established guidelines, the Con­

      ference approved a recommendation that the Director of the Ad­

      ministrative Office include in the fiscal year 1976 budget a sufficient 

      number of deputy clerks to adjust the ratio of deputy clerks to 



         561-849 0 - 75   3
                                  52 

civil and criminal filings projected for the various district courts
for fiscal year 1976 to 1 to 100, and to meet any other justifiable
needs according to the equities thereof. Any additional positions
authorized for fiscal year 1975 are to be deducted from this number
on a court-by-court basis.
   The Conference further authorized the inclusion in the budget
of a request for funds for additional personnel for the clerks' offices
from time to time and in such number as the workload warrants
for the performance of the additiona.l duties brought about by the
impact of the United States magistrates system upon the work
of the clerks' offices, particularly that of the Central Violations
Bureau.

Probation Officers
  The Conference agI:eed that the fiscal year 1976 request for pro­
bation officers and clerk-stenographers in the probation offices be
the total of the unfulfilled requests for fiscal year 1975 and the new
requirements established for fiscal year 1976-155 probation officers
and 116 clerk-stenographers.

Miscellaneous Positions-Courts of Appeals
   The Conference agreed with the recommendation to seek one
library clerk for the Second Circuit at New York City and one
library clerk for the Third Circuit at Philadelphia as well as an
assistant librarian for the Fourth Circuit at Richmond. The Con­
ference further approved two motions clerks for the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and one each
for the Second Circuit and the Third Circuit. The Conference also
requested the Subcommittee on Supporting Personnel to review the
needs of satellite libraries with a view to making a recommenda­
tion to the next session of the Conference.

Interpreter
  The Conference approved the request for an interpreter for the
Southern District of Texas at Laredo.
  REI'IRIDMENT OF DIRECTORS OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE AND
                     FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER

  The Conference considered a report on the present statutory
provisions relating to the retirement of the Director and Deputy          (
                                        53 

     Director of the Administrative Office and the Director of the Fed-
r	   eral Judicial Center and agreed to recommend to the Congress a
     proposed bill which would amend Section 611 and Section 627 of
     Title 28, United States Code. The Conference noted that the posi­
     tion of Deputy Director of the Federal Judicial Center is not a
     statutory position. The proposed legislation would apply as well
     to the Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice. In approving
     these recommendations the Conference noted that the present
     statute makes no provision for cost-of-living increases and that
     while the proposed legislation would not affect present incumbents
     of the positions, the ret.irement provisions are not geared to attract
     and hold qualified individuals who do not have long civil service
     retirement credit or other types of retirement benefits, and that
     the statute should be amended to bring the retirement benefits in
     line with similar benefits in comparable positions.

                                  LEGISLATION

        The Conference disapproved S. 3590 which would permit a judge
     who retires at less than full salary under 28 U.S.G 372 to receive
     9, prorata salary of his office while serving on an intercircuit assign­

{    ment under 28 U.S.c. 294 and upon completion of ten years of
     service to receive the full salary of the office.
        The Conference disapproved S. 3501 relating to consumer claims
     which would reduce to $1,000 the amount in controversy in federal
     question and diversity cases and permit such cases to be tried before
     a magistrate with right of trial de novo in the district court.
        The Conference disapproved H.R. 12745 providing for speedy
     consideration of cases arising in connection with the Central Utah
     Reclamation Project.
        The Conference agreed that H.R. 9062 and H.R. 16423 concern­
     ing the resolution of claims and disputes relating to government
     contracts involve matters of legislative policy but the Conference
     urged that the Congress give consideration to the impact on the
     federal courts of the passage of such legislation.

                          REVIEW COMMITTEE
       The report of the Review Committee was presented by Judge
     Edward A. Tamm, Chairman.

tion at the prior meeting of the Committee.

   The foregoing is set forth pursuant to the resolution of the Judi­
cial Conference at its March 1971 session (Conf. Rept., p. 24) and
subsequently amended to include full-time bankruptcy judges and
magistrates.
   The Conference discussed other aspects of the reporting of extra­
judicial income and agreed that the reporting form should be re­
vised so as to include all pertinent instructions so that judicial
officers will have all necessary instructions before them in preparing
the form.

   JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE CODE OF JUDICIAL
                  CONDUcr

  The report of the Joint Committee was presented by Judge
Edward A. Tamm, who with Judge Elbert P. Tuttle is a co-chair­
man of the Joint Committee.
                                      55
        The Conference considered the provisions of S. 1064, a bill to
     provide for the disqualification of judges, and disapproved the
     legislation on the basis that enactment is unnecessary at this time
     in view of the adoption by the Conference of the "Code of Judicial
     Conduct for United States Judges." The Conference was agreed
     that in the training of new judges the Federal Judicial Center
     should devote a substantial period of time to the Code, including
     references to the official Notes prepared by the reporter to the
     ABA Committee, and, further, that these matters should also be
     included in refresher courses for judges now being offered by the
     Center.

       ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES
        Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman of the Advisory Committee
     un Judicial Activities, presented the Committee's report.
       Judge Tuttle advised the Conference that since its last report
     to the March session the Committee has resolved through corres­
     pondence and Committee discussion ten formal inquiries from
     judges, bankruptcy judges and magistrates, and completed work
     on six inquiries received from the Review Committee. In addition,
(	   the Chairman of the Committee has resolved numerous informal
     inquiries by letter or telephone. In the last six months the Commit­
     tee has published seven formal opinions, bringing to 38 the total
     number of formal opinions issued by the Committee.

           COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE
                     JURY SYSTEM
       The report of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System
     was presented by Judge Arthur J. Stanley, Jr., Chairman.
                           LAND 	CoNDEMNATION

       The Conference, on recommendation of the Committee, disap··
     proved two bills, S. 3446 and S. 510, which would effect changes
     in Rule 71A (h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by man­
     dating jury trials in certain situations where land commissioners
     are also used.
                  PR(YI'ECTION OF JURORS' EMPLOYMENT

       The Conference voted to reendorse H.R. 10897, a bill introduced
(    as a result of a Conference recommendation at the 'September 1973
                                    56 

 session (Conf. Rept.. p. 56). The bill would provide for injunctive
 relief and a civil penalty against employers who discharge em­
 ployees by reason of their service as federal jurors.

                     AUTOMATED JURY SELEUI'ION

   The Conference agreed to reendorse H.R. 10896, a bill originally 

 recommended at the September 1973 session (Conf. Rept., p. 55). 

 This bill would amend the Jury Selection and Service Act to define 

 "public drawing" and to permit facsimile signatures on the jury 

 summons to meet the requirements of automated processing. 


                            SIZE OF JURIES

   The Conference again expressed its approval of two pending 

bills, S. W57 and H.R. 8285, to reduce the jury to six members in 

civil cases and to reduce peremptory challenges from three to two. 


                         PERIODIC REPORTING

  At the March 1974 session of the Judicial Conference (Conf.
Rept., p. 21) the Conference agreed that working jury committees
should be appointed by the chief judge in each circuit to keep ("
abreast of developments in the field of jury selection and to deal
with problems which exist or may arise in the several districts or
divisions of the circuit. The Conference agreed again to request all
courts which have not already done so to comply with this action.
At the same time, in view of the fact that the data collection pro­
cedures on form JS 12 are in the process of being revised, the
Conference agreed that no periodic reporting data need be sub­
mitted until further notice from the Judicial Conference when the
J8 12 form revision has been completed.

                        AUTOMATION PROJECT

  The Conference was advised that an increasing number of states
are switching from county voter registration systems to state-wide
systems, using automated data processing which allows constant
purging and updating of the lists. Automated jury processing as a
result is now feasible in a district even if less than half of all voter
names in that district are on automated processing tapes. Time
savings in districts which have adopted automated data processing
                                                                           (
                                        57 

are projected at 50 to 74 percent of clerical time used in the manual
process. The Conference agreed that all clerks of court whose jury
selection procedures are not now fully or partially automated
should seek out the information as to state or county voter list
status from the appropriate state officials so that feasibility of
conversion can be determined.

         QUALIFICATION AS A RESTORATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS

   The Conference was advised of a study prepared under the aus­
pices of the Committee relating to subsection 5 of Section 1865(b)
of Title 28, United States Code, which provides that a person is
qualified for jury service unless he ha:s a charge pending against
him for the commission of or has been convicted of a crime punish­
able by imprisonment for more than one year {land his civil rights
have not been restored by pardon or amnesty." The Committee's
report pointed out that in light of the rapidly changing concepts
of rehabilitation as seen in legislative enfranchisement of ex-felons
in many state systems, the words "pardon or amnesty" should be
deleted from the qualification section. The word "pardon" is con­
sidered to be inconclusive when applied to persons who have paid
their debts to society as a result of convictions for crimes and who
are frequently restored to full civic status by state and federal
statutes and other procedures not coming within the definition of
"pardon." The word "amnesty" appears inapplicable since it does
not act to restore civil rights but precludes prosecution in the first
instance. The Conference approved a draft bill to effect these pur­
poses and agreed that the Subcommittee report should be sent to
the Congress along with the legislative proposal.

                        EXCUSES AND EXEMPTIONS

   The Conference received a report reflecting an examination of
district jury plans and particularly exemption and excuse provi­
sions and agreed that the report should be transmitted to the chief
judge of each circuit for the purpose of forwarding the report to
the reviewing panels for consideration. It specifically recommended
that the jury plans be reexamined for the purpose of determining:
  (1) Whether the exemption eategories beyond the statutory 1863('b) (6) ex­
empti()ns in the plans are too broadly stated and whether SUbstantial reaS(}llS ()t
poliey underlie each class exemption;
  (2) Whether the excuse categories are similarly overbroad;
                                        58 

   (3) Whether both excuse and exemption categories eliminate professionals
from jury lists in an overly broad manner;
   (4) Whether students should be given temporary excuses (§ 1866 (c) (1) ),
rather than permanent excuses (§ 1863(b) (5» which removes them from con­
sideration for jury service entirely;
   (5) Whether, in districts which have excuses for a sole proprietor, It more
adequate definition should be adopted as a class eligible for excuses such as the
following:
     'Any person whose services are so essential to the operation of a business,
     commercial or an agricultural enterprise that said enterprise must close if
      such person were required to perform jury duty;
   (6) Whether excuse structures which contain catch-all provisions not clearly
authorized by § 1863(b) (5) (since they do not relate to any specific class or group
of persons or occupational classes) should be deleted from those plans which
contain them.

    COMMITEEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

                CRIMINAL LAW 

  Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.

                       SPEEDY TRIAL LEGISLATION

  Judge Zirpoli advised that on the previous day he had testified
before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee on the
Senate-passed bill, S. 754, which among other things would provide
specific time limits for the criminal p'rocess. Judge Zirpoli submitted
to the Conference his report on the operation of provisions of Rule
5O(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and on his recom­
mendation the Conference agreed to urge the House Judiciary Com­
mittee to defer action on S. 754 until the close of the fiscal year
1975 to enable the judiciary to prove the effectiveness of the Rule
50(b) plans in the prompt disposition of criminal cases.

                          REVIEW OF SENTENCES

  The Conference was advised that the Committee favors the al­
ternative to appellate review of sentences provided by the proposed
amendment to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
with certain modifications as follows: (1) that the panel of review
judges consist of one circuit and two district judges; (2) that mem­
bership on the panel be rotated as far as is practicable in the dis­
cretion of the assigning judge and (3) that the motion to review
such sentences shall apply to any sentence which may result in
imprisonment regardless of the period thereof.
                                     59

                               GRAND JURY

       Judge Zirpoli advised the Conference that his Committee had
    conununicated to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules its
     view that Rule 6(a) of the criminal rules should be revised to re­
    duce the number of grand jurors (preferably not less than nine nor
    more than 15, with the concurrence of two-thirds required for re­
    turn of an indictment). The Advisory Committee was also told that
    the Criminal Law Committee approved a recommendation to
    amend Rule 6( e) to require the recording of all testimony and oral
    statements before the grand jury although many members of the
    Committee expressed serious reservations as to the wisdom of pro­
    viding the alternative of electronic recording.
       The Advisory Committee was also told that the Criminal Law
    Committee favors amendment of Rule 7(g) to provide that a mo­
    tion to dismiss the indictment may not be based upon the ground
    that the indictment is not supported by sufficient evidence. The
    Committee also favored legislation under study by the Advisory
    Committee insofar as it would require witnesses not to disclose
    matters occurring before a grand jury when specifically directed to
    refrain from such disclosure by the court.

                           VOLUNTARY SURRENDER

       Judge Zirpoli advised that his Committee, at the request of the
    Probation Committee, had reviewed the proposed statement of pro­
    cedures to provide for the voluntary surrender of selected sentenced
    offenders to the Bureau of Prison's institutions and the proposed
    implementing legislation and it joined the Probation Committee
    in recommending C-onference approval.

                      COMMITTEE ON HABEAS CORPUS
      The report of the Committee on Habeas Corpus was presented
    to the Conference by its Chairman, Judge Walter E. Hoffman.
      Judge Hoffman advised that the Committee had under consid­
    eration, in cooperation with a committee from the Federal Judicial
    Center, draft legislation dealing with "prisoner cases" filed under
    Section 1983 of Title 42, United States Code, and related statutes.
    This matter remains under study and will be the subject of a later
    report.

    COMMITEEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
   The report of the Committee on Intercircuit Assignments was
presented by Judge Roy W. Harper and covered the period Febru­
ary 1 to August 15, 1974.
   Judge Harper stated that during the reporting period the Com­
mittee recommended 94 assignments to be undertaken by 69 judges.
Of this number, five are senior circuit judges, 11 are active circuit
judges, 18 are district judges in active status and 19 are senior
district judges. One retired Supreme Court justice, one senior judge
of the Court of Claims and one senior judge of the Customs Court
participated in seven assignments.

                        RECOMMENDATION

  On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference endorsed
the policy that district judges may be designated to serve on an
intercircuit assignment for as short a period as two weeks and
that such as;ignment shall not extend more than 750 miles beyond
the boundary of their circuits. Upon such assignment the receiving
court is to prepare a list of cases which are ready for trial and
which are to be transferred to the visiting judge for trial upon his
arrival, such list to contain at least 15 civil and at least eight
criminal cases, or a combination of the two. The cases shall be set
for trial at the times directed by the visiting judge.

      COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                  PROCEDURE 

  The report of the standing Committee on Rules of Practice
and Procedure was presented by the Chairman, Judge Roszel C.
Thomsen.
                       BANKRUPTCY RULES

   The Conference reviewed and approved for transmittal to the
Supreme Court, with an endorsement for favorable action, the pro­
posed rules under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act (Corf,orate
Reorganization) and Chapter XII (Real Property Arrangements).
These rules have previously been widely circulated for comment
to the bench and bar.
  Judge Thomsen advised that the rules and forms, previously
approved and transmitted to the Supreme Court, under Chapter
                                61 

XI of the Bankruptcy Act (Arrangements) pursuant to the order
                                            1


of the Court and without any adverse comment from the Congress
became effective July 1, 1974.
   A preliminary draft of proposed rules under Chapter IX (Com­
position of Indebtedness of Certain Taxing Agencies) has been dis­
tributed to the bench and bar for comment and a draft of rules
governing railroad reorganization procedures under Chapter VIII
are now under active .consideration by the Advisory Committee.

                        CRIMINAL RULES

   The proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure approved by the Judicial Conference at the October 1972
session and subsequently prescribed by the Supreme Court were
transmitted to the Congress on April 22, 1974, setting August 1,
1974 as the effective date. As a result of the enactment of Public
Law 93-361 which became effective July 31, 1974, the effective date
of these rules has been changed until August 1, 19·75, with a view
to permitting Congress to examine the amendments and to hold
hearings thereon. Initial hearings at which representatives of the
Committee and the Advisory Committee appeared were held on
September 17.
                       RULES OF EVIDENCE

   On February 6, 1974 the House of Representatives passed H.R.
5463 which incorporated some of the rules of evidence as prescribed
by the Supreme Court, together with many changes made by the
House of Representatives. On June 4, 5 and 6 the Senate Com­
mittee on the Judiciary held hearings on H.R. 5463 at which
representatives of the standing Committee and the Advisory Com­
mittee on Rules of Evidence testified. As of the time of the Con­
ference session no report of the Senate committee had been issued.

                        ApPELLATE RULES

   Judge Thomsen advised the Conference that the first meeting
of the newly reorganized Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules
was scheduled for September 20, 1974. Professor Jo Desha Lucas
of the University of Chicago School of Law has been named as
reporter of the Committee under the chairmanship of Judge Wil­
liam Henry Hastie, senior judge of the Third Circuit.

     COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                 JUSTICE ACT 

 The report of the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice
Act was presented by the Chairman, Judge Dudley B. Bonsal.

                  ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   The Conference authorized for distribution the report of the
Administrative Office on appointments and payments through
June 30, 1974. It was noted tha,t approximately 65,000 persons
were represented by counsel appointed pursuant to the Criminal
Justice Act in fiscal year 1974-43,000 in the federal courts and
12,000 in the local courts of the District of Columbia. During fiscal
year 1974 Congress appropriated $18,675,000 for the operation of
the Criminal Justice Act, of which $3,000,000 was earmarked spe­
cifically for assignments in the local courts of the District of Co­
lumbia. Commencing with fiscal year 1975 appropriations for the
operation of the appointed counsel system in the District of Co­
lumbia are being supported through the District of Columbia
appropriations rather than through the appropriations for the
federal judiciary. A separate Criminal Justice Act for the local
courts of the District of Columbia has been enacted as Public Law       (    /


93-412 which became law on September 3, 1974.

                         D:IDFENDER OFFICES

   Judge BonsaI advised that in the past year new federal public
defender offices have been established in Kansa<J, Maryland, Ne­
vada, New Jersey, the Northern District of Ohio, the Western
District of Tennessee and the Virgin Islands. Additional federal
public defender offices are scheduled to commence operations early
in fiscal year 1975 in the Eastern District of Louisiana, the Western
District of Pennsylvania and the Southern District of Texas. Two
new community defender organizations operating on federal grants
were started in the District of Oregon and the Northern District
of Georgia.
  The Conference considered the individual budget requests for
each of the federal public defender offices for fiscal year 1976 as
well as the additional appropriation requests for fiscal year 1975
and the Committee recommendations thereon and the results will
be incorporated in the budget requests to be submitted pursuant to
Conference action.                                                          -'

                              GRAND JURY WITNESSES
         At the September 1973 session the Judicial Conference deter­
     mined (Conf. Rept., p. 59) that when a judge appoints counsel for
     a witness before a grand jury in which he is satisfied that the wit­
     Hess faces possible loss of liberty, such appointment shall be deemed
     to be an appointment under the Criminal Justice Act. Judge BonsaI
     :;l,dvised the Conference that the Committee had determined that
     if at a later time the same witness appears at trial and the judge
     makes a finding that the witness faces loss of liberty the judge may
     again appoint counsel under the Criminal Justice Act and such
     appointment shall be deemed a new appointment.
                        PAROLE REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS

        The Conference was advised that the United States Board of
     Parole had issued regulations (Federal Register, Vol. 39, No. 109,
     June 5, 1974) which afforded a parolee three stages of hearings­
     the intial hearing, an appeal to a regional board and a final hearing
     by the Board. Judge BonsaI advised the Conference that his Com­
     mittee had agreed that when counsel is appointed for the parolee
     under the Criminal Justice Act, such appointment, if made at the
     initial or intermediate stage, shall be regarded as a continuing
     appointment. An attorney so appointed has an obligation to advise
     the parolee of his rights of appeal and of representation at each
     stage.
                          REPRESENTATION ON ApPEAL
       The Conference was advised that the Committee has instructed
     the Administrative Office to place a rubber stamp on all voucher
     forms (and incorporate in the text when the vouchers are next
     revised) which will read:
     Has the defendant paid any money to you since his arrest or to your knowledge
     to anyone else in connection with the offense for which you were appointed to
     defend him? If so, give details.
                    COUNSEL IN DISCRETIONARY ApPEALS
        Judge BonsaI advised the Conference that the Committee has
     considered existing plans of the courts of appeals in light of the
     decision of the Supreme Court in Ross v. Moffitt (No. 73-786, de­
     cided June 17, 1974) in which the Court held that the fact that a
     discretionary appeal has been provided does not require the state
     to provide counsel to indigent defendants for such discretionary
     a,ppeal.
        After reviewing the pertinent plans, all of which place the burden
(    as assigned counsel and the courts of advising the defendant of
'-
     his right to appeal ,and preparing the petition for writ of certiorari
                                  64 

 if requested, the Committee decided that Ross v. Moffitt requires
 no change in existing plans since the language of the Criminal
 Justice Act specifically provides for representation for a defendant
 at every stage of the proceedings, from his initial appearance before
 the United States magistrate or court through appeal. including
 ancillary matters appropriate to the proceedings.
    COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

               PROBATION SYSTEM 

  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Pro­
bation System was presented by Judge Albert C. Wollenberg,
Chairman.
                      SENTENCING INSTITUTE
  The Conference approved a recommendation of the Committee
that the judges of the District of Columbia Circuit be invited to
participate in the Joint Sentencing Institute for the Fourth and
Fifth Circuits scheduled for Atlanta, Georgia, on October 28-30,
1974. The Institute was previously approved by the Conference
at its March 1974 session (Conf. Rept., p. 30).
               PROTECTION OF PROBATION OFFICERS
   The Conference approved for transmittal to the Congress a draft
of a bill to provide for the protection of probation officers by
amending Section 1114 of Title 18, United States Code. The Con­
ference has on numerous occasions recommended legislation to
afford protection to probation officers (see Conf. Repts., March
1970, p. 28, and March 1971, p. 48). The Conference took note not
only of the various types of persons' with whom probation officers
must deal but also the circumstances in which these persons are
met, the neighborhoods involved and the level of hostility toward
persons associated with law enforcement. These ha,zards have been
highlighted recently by the shooting of two probation officers while
in the performance of their official duties-one in Memphis in May
1973 and the other in the District of Columbia in June 1974.
               VOLUNTARY SURRENDER PROCEDURES
  At the March 1974 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 31)
the Committee reported to the Conference that it had endorsed a
statement of procedures drawn by the Probation Division, the
Bureau of Prisons and the Marshals Service that would provide
for the voluntary surrender of selected sentenced offenders to the
Bureau of Prisons' institutions. Since criminal contempt appeared
the only sanction available where a prisoner failed to surrender as
directed, the Conference approved a proposed bill which would
                                             65 

     provide a penalty in the event of failure to report. The Director
    of the Administrative Office was instructed to transmit the pro­
    posed legislation to the Congress.
                  FORM To FACILITATE COMMUNICATION
       The Conference was advised that at the request of the Commit­
    tee, representatives of the Federal Judicial Center, the Probation
    Division, the Bureau of Prisons and the Board of Parole have
    worked together to develop a form to assist judges in communicat­
    ing to correctional agencies anything about the reasons for selection
    of sentence that might be of help to those agencies in discharging
    their responsibilities. The Conference was advised that based upon
    experimental use of this form (AO 235), it will be distributed to
    the district court judges for use.
        COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                         BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM
       Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman of the Committee on the
    Administration of the Bankruptcy System, presented the report of
    the Committee.

                                     CASE FILINGS

  There were 189,513 new bankruptcy case filing in fiscal year 1974
or a 9.4 percent increase over the number filed in fiscal year 1973.
A breakdown of the types of cases filed in fiscal year 1974 shows                          ,
                                                                                           .
                                                                                           I
                                              69 

      that the greater proportion of these filings are business cases. A
      total of 20,746 business bankruptcies was filed in fiscal Yf>ar 1974,
      which is the largest number of business filings on record. Business
      cases represented 10.9 percent of the total cases filed. Chapter XI
      arrangements increased to a record 2,171 cases, or by 48.9 percent;
      Chapter XIII wage earner plans increased to 29,019, or by 13.2
      percent, in fiscal year 1974.

                      REFEREES' SALARY AND EXPENSE FUND

         While figures showing total payments into the Referees' Salary
      and Expense Fund for fiscal year 1974 were not available at the
      time of the session of the Conferency, it was estimated that re­
      ceipts would cover approximately 71 percent of the cost of the
      system, estimated at $20,506,000 in fiscal year 1974. The Confer­
      ence reaffirmed its previous position that a self-supporting bank­
      ruptcy system is outdated and it is no longer feasible to maintain
      a self-supporting bankruptcy system without placing an inordinate
      burden on debtors and bankrupt estates.

                             CoST 	OF LIVING INCREASES

       The Conference agreed that part-time referees in bankruptcy
     should receive cost of living increases within the statutory maxi­
     mum provided that they are in compliance with provisions of the
     Bankruptcy Act pertaining to salary increases.

          COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                   MAGISTRATES SYSTEM
        The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Mag­
     istrates System was given by its Chairman, Judge Charles M.
     Metzner.
                                   SALARY MATl'ElRS

       The Conference took the following action with regard to Com­
     mittee recommendations relating to salary matters:
        (1) Approved $350 per annum as a minimum salary for all part-time
     magistrates;
        (2) Adopted a policy that the aggregate compensation of an individual who
     holds a combination position of part-time magistrate and clerk of a district court
     shall not exceed the salary payable to either a full-time magistrate or a clerk
     of court of a large district court, whichever is lesser;
,	      (3) Adopted a policy that an individual who holds a combination position of
l    part-time magistrate and part-time referee in bankruptcy be considered a full-time
                                       70 

 judicial officer when the aggregate compensation of his position reaches $25,000
 per annum;
    (4) Adopted a policy that the aggregate compensation of an individual who
 holds a combination position of part-time magistrate and part-time referee in
 bankruptcy shall not exceed the salary payable to either a full-time magistrate
 Or a full-time referee in bankruptcy, whichever is lesser.

                        CoST-OF~LIVING INCREASES
    The Conference authorized the annual cost-of-living salary in­
 crease for all full-time magistrates whose salaries are below the
 statutory limit and all part-time magistrates whose salaries have
 been fixed at proposed standard levels. The Conference agreed to
 withhold such increases from those part-time magistrates whose
 salaries are above the appropriate standard levels and granted to
 the Administrative Office discretion, following notice to the Mag­
 istrates Committee, to make minor adjustments in cost-of-living
 increases in order to place additional part-time positions within
 the proposed standard levels.

                  CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

     The Conference ratified the action of the Executive Committee
  which, at the request of the Magistrates Committee, authorized
  the conversion of the clerk/magistrate position at Portland, Maine,
  to a part-time magistrate position at a salary of $10,000 per annum.
  The Conference approved the recommendations of the Committee
  for five new full-time positions, the conversion of 12 part-time
  positions and one combination clerk/magistrate position to a full­
  time position, one new part-time position, the discontinuance of
 65 part-time positions, the continuation of 240 part-time positions
 and seven combination positions for additional four-year terms,
 increases in the salaries of 171 part-time positions and three combi­
 nation positions, decreases in the salaries of 15 part-time positions,
 changes in the official locations of six positions, authorization of
 dual district jurisdiction to one part-time position and authoriza­
 tion for the appointment of a non-attorney to one part-time posi­
tion. This action of the Conference increased the number of
full-time positions from 112 to 130, decreased the number of com­
bination positions from 18 to 16 and the number of part-time posi­
tions from 411 to 336. These changes were all approved, subject to
the availability of funds, based upon the recommendations of the
Administrative Office, the district courts, the judicial councils of
the circuits and the Committee itself.

 additional data are presented and report back to the Conference at
 its next session.
                        SPECIAL REPORT
    Judge J. Skelly Wright and Ambassador Richard D. Kearney
  presented to the Conference on behalf of the Advisory Committee
  to the Secretary of State on Private International Law a report
 on a convention abolishing the requirement of legalization for
 foreign public documents. The Judicial Conference is represented
 on the Advisory Committee by Judge George H. Boldt and Judge
 Wright.
    The Department of State requested the Judicial Conference for
 its views on this third Hague Convention abolishing the require­
ment of legalization for foreign public documents which was
 adopted at the 1960 session when the United States was not yet a
member of the Conference. The United States joinder was accom­
plished by the technique of accession authorized in Article 12 of
the Hague Convention. The Judicial Conference approved this ac­
cession as requested by the Department of State. The effect of the
Conventon is to abolish the requirement of diplomatic or consular
legalization for foreign public documents and to substitute a simple
form specified in the Convention, by officials designated by title
rather than by name.

                      COMMEMORATION
   Noting with regret the death of former Chief Justice Earl War­
 ren who for sixteen years presided over the sessions of the Judicial
 Conference, the Conference adopted the following commemoration
 of Chief Justice Warren:
   The sorrow with which this Conference commemorates the death
of former Chief Justice Earl Warren cannot but be tempered by
 our gratitude for the years he spent among us. He made us all
aware that ((recognition of inherent dignity and of the equal and
inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foun­
dation of freedom, justice and peace in the world." For more than
a half century, he unselfishly committed his life to that service of
the human family-as a District Attorney, Attorney General, and
later Governor of California, and for sixteen years as the Chief
Justice of the United States.
   His period of service as Chief Justice coincided with an era of
far-reaching constitutional interpretations. We witnessed new and
                                   98
  different emphasis on fundamental rights of racial and religious
  minorities and of individual liberties under the Constitution. The
  continued extension of the Bill of Rights to the states enlarged
  the rights of the accused and the convicted.
                                                                             r
     During a period of unprecedented social change, he never lost
  sight of the high ideal that the law should not be severed from its
  ethical roots. The opinion of the Court which he announced in
 Brown vs. Board of Education marked a watershed in American
 jurisprudence, directing the attention of this country toward ills
                                                                                 I
 which required (;Ure. In an effort to seek a fairer society, he clung
 to the basic tenet of democracy that the right of suffrage is a pre­
 condition to acceptable and lasting reform.
    We recall also the many years during which he presided over the
 Judicial Conference of the United States, giving it his leadership
 and guidance. And, as father of the Federal Judicial Center concept
 he laid the groundwork for increa~ed efficiency in court administra­
 tion and continuing education for members of the judiciary and
 supporting personnel.
    Finally, for showing us the virtues of exercising wise and compas­
 sionate judgment toward our fellowmen, we shall be forever in his
 debt.

 PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS
