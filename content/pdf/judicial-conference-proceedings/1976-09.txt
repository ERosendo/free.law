       REPORTS OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE 

  ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES 

                   COURTS 



  The Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Rowland F.
Kirks, presented to the Conference the report on the business of
the United States courts for the twelve-month period, ending June
30, 1976. The Conference agreed to the release of this report.
  The Annual Report of the Director showed that the workload
                                 33 


of the courts continued to increase in 1976. Filings in the courts of
appeals rose almost II percent over a year ago to a newall-time
high of 18,408. Terminations also increased but were almost 2,000
less than the number filled. As a result the pending case load
increased more than 16 percent to a newall-time high of 14,110
appeals. The backlog of pending cases is now more than double
what it was in 1968 when the last increase in the number of
j udgeshi ps occurred.
   In the district courts civil case filings increased more than II
percent; terminations rose by approximately 5,400 cases over a
year ago, but the pending caseload continued to increase to a
record 140,189 as of June 30th. This was a record increase of 17
percent over the 119,767 civil cases pending a year ago. From 1960
to 1976 the pending caseload increased 129 percent.
   Criminal case filings in the district courts declined more than
five percent to 41,020. The comparison of this year's filings with
last year's, however, is not entirely appropriate because of a
change in the method of statistical case accounting required as a
result of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974. Superseding indictments
are no longer being counted as separate cases, which tends to
reduce the number of filings. On the other hand, certain
misdemeanor cases, falling within the minor offense trial
jurisdiction of United States magistrates and carried on their
dockets, are now being carried on the criminal dockets of the
district courts so that they may be accounted for under the
requirements of speedy trial.
   Bankruptcy case filings were 246,549, a decrease of almost 8,000
from the record number of filings last year - constituting a
decrease of three percent.
   The Director also submitted and the Conference approved the
release to the Congress of the first annual report required to be
submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Speedy Trial Act of
 1974.
   The report, in two parts, summarized in general terms the
speedy trial plans submitted by the district courts pursuant to
Title I of the Act and the accomplishments of the pretrial service
agencies established during the year in ten district courts on a
demonstration basis pursuant to Title II of the Act. The report
contained very little statistical information inasmuch as the time
limitations imposed by speedy trial were for the most past not in
effect during the year and the pretrial service agencies were in
operation only during the last six months of the statistical year.
                                                               34 

                          COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
   Judge Carl A. Weinman, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on the Budget.
   The Conference approved the proposed budget estimates for the
fiscal year 1978 which, exclusive of the Supreme Court, the
.Customs Court and the Federal Judicial Center, were in the
aggregate amount of $411,670,000. This represents a proposed
increase in budget authority over fiscal year 1977 of $41,020,000.
The estimates were based on the assumption of a general pay
increase average of 4.83 percent, commencing October 1, 1976,
and also took into account the recommendations of the respective
committees of the Judicial Conference. The Director of. the
Administrative Office was authorized to submit supplemental
requests for 1977 and to amend the budget for 1978 if required as a
result of new legislation, actions of the Judicial Conference or for
any other purpose he considers necessary and appropriate.
   Included in the proposed budget for 1978 under the heading

  The request for 12 new positions for circuit executives is in lieu
of the prior request thrice denied by the Congress for deputy
circuit executives and carries out a resolution of the chief judges
of the courts of appeals for staff assistants for the circuit
executives.
  Provision has been made for the first time for the payment of
the compensation of land commissioners appointed pursuant to
Rule 7lA(h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Previously
land commissioners have been paid by the Department of Justice.
  The Director also was authorized to submit a draft bill to the
Congress to amend the Court Reports Act so as to authorize the
                               35 

expenditure of appropriated funds for the procurement of
equipment and other expenses incident to the implementation of
a program for computerized transcripts.

                 COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The report of the Committee on Court Administration was
presented by the Chairman, Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr.

       UNIFORM RULES OF DISCIPLINARY ENFORCEMENT

   Immediately following the April 1976 session of the Confer­
ence, the Committee, through its Subcommittee on Judicial
Improvements, undertook consideration of the American Bar
Association committee's proposed guidelines for Uniform Rules
of Disciplinary Enforcement as to lawyers in the federal courts.
The guidelines in the form in which they were proposed to the
states were circulated to every federal judge for an expression of
views. As a result of the Subcommittee's deliberations, Judge
Ainsworth reported to the Conference that it was his Committee's
view that the guidelines for the discipline of attorneys are not
properly rules of practice and procedure and, accordingly, would
recommend that it would be proper for the Judicial Conference to
approve proposed guidelines and urge each of the Federal courts
in the nation to adopt them. Inasmuch as this subject affects
intimately the authority of the courts, the Committee advised the
Conference that the guidelines would not be submitted for
approval until the Spring 1977 session and that meanwhile the
guidelines as approved by the Subcommittee and the Committee
would be circulated to all members of the federal judiciary for
comment prior to the next meeting of the Conference.

                     LAND CoMMISSIONERS

   The Conference approved the recommendation of the Commit­
tee, as well as the proposed budgetary estimates of the Committee
on the Budget, for the transfer of the appropriation for fees of
land commissioners from the Department of Justice to the federal
judiciary. In budget submissions for fiscal year 1977 the De­
partment of Justice did not request an appropriation for the fees
of land commissioners. When the matter was brought to the
Appropriations Subcommittee of the House of Representatives an
appropriation for fees for land commissioners was made to the
Department of Justice through the fiscal year 1977. In its report
                                            36 


the Appropriation Subcommittee stated, however, that prior to
requesting the appropriation for the fiscal year ending September
30, 1978 it would expect the Judicial Conference of the United
States and the Department of Justice to come to an agreement
concerning this appropriation. Judge Ainsworth reported that his
Committee had explored the possibility of imposing upon the
condemning agency the payment of the fees of land commission­
ers but the legality of this procedure appeared questionable.

                         PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

  The Conference disapproved H. R. 11003, a bill which would
authorize the holding of court in Houma in the Eastern District of
Louisiana. The Conference noted that the judges of the district
court involved and of the judicial council of the circuit all
recommended against approval of the proposed legislation.

                                 REGISTRY FUNDS

   The Conference noted that there are four options open to the
courts wirh regard to the deposit of registry funds: (1) to deposit
in Treasury accounts pursuant to 31 USC 725V; (2) to deposit in
private banks in checking accounts at no interest by specific order
of the courts; (3) to deposit in private banks or savings and loan
associations in interest-bearing accounts by specific order of the
courts and (4) to order the parties themselves to make arrange­
ments for the purchase of securities or bonds which are then
placed in the custody of the courts.
   Depositing these funds in Treasury accounts has presented
difficulties because of the problem of obtaining prompt and easy
withdrawals of portions of the deposited funds as needed by the
courts and because of the difficulty in obtaining a government
record which adequately reflects the current status of the account.
   The Conference was in agreement that since the situations
involving the deposit of funds in the registry of the court are
diverse, no hard and fast rule can be established. The Conference
did, however, approve a general policy statement and broad
guidelines to aid particular district courts, as follows:
        I. Where it is reasonably predictable that the particular registry funds or
   substantially all of them will remain with the United States, or that the United
   States has the substantial beneficial interest therein, or that the interest of justice
   so requires, such funds should be deposited in Treasury accounts pursuant to
   Title 31, United States Code, §725v.
        2. Whenever practical and feasible all substantial sums of registry funds not
                                                           37
   deposited in Treasury accounts pursuant to Title 31, United States Code, §725V
   should be placed in some form of (substantial) interest-bearing accounts (which
   will earn interest at approximately the existing market rate).
        3. Courts should avoid the unnecessary placing of substantial sums, interest­
   free, in private banks.
                                       QUADRENNIAL SURVEY

   The quadrennial survey of judgeship needs in the district
courts was conducted during 1976 by the Subcommittee on
Judicial Statistics with assistance and support from the staff of the
Administrative Office. In conducting this survey the Subcommit­
tee considered the recommendations of the district courts and the
judicial councils of the circuits, as well as the statistical
information available in the Administrative Office.
   Upon completion ot this survey, the recommendations
resulting therefrom were again submitted to the courts concerned
for further comment. Upon the basis of the work of the
Subcommittee, the Committee recommended and the Judicial
Conference approved a recommendation to the Congress for the
creation of 106 additional United States district judgeships, as
follows:
            Court                                                                     Number of Judgeships

  The Conference further approved as an emergency measure the
recommendation to the Congress for the creation of three
additional circuit judgeships in the District of Columbia Circuit.
In so doing, the Conference noted the sharp rise in the number of
appeals filed per judgeship in the first six months of fiscal year
1976, with the largest increase occurring in the number of appeals
from administrative agencies which rose by more than 100
percent.

                             SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

Court Reporters for Senior Judges
    The Conference approved the following policy statement
with regard to court reporters for senior judges:
     Any time an active district judge takes senior status and expects to continue to
   render substantial service to his court and a request is made on his behalf by the
   court that he will continue to need the service of a reporter, such a request will be
   granted for whatever type of service is appropriate under title 28, United States
   Code, §75l1, on a temporary rather than a pennanent basis.
     When a request is made by the court for the pretrial reportorial service for a
   senior judge who requires a reporter only on an intertnittent basis, such a request
   will be granted.
     Regular review of the continued need for reportorial service is expected to be
   made.

Quality Step Increases for Court Personnel
  In order to adopt a plan such as all government departments
and agencies have to award superior performance, the Conference
approved the following resolution:
     The Conference nores that the federal judiciary is the only branch of the federal
   government which does not provide for rewarding superior performance by its
   graded employees through a quality within-grade step increase plan or similar
   administrative mechanism. Therefore, it is the feeling of the Conference that such
   a plan should be budgeted for and implemented and that the plan should,
   initially. take the form of the plan submitted for its consideration by the
                                           40 

  Committee on CAJun Administration. This plan supersedes the provisions in
  effect heretofore for career law clerks.
     It is the sense of the Conference that the provisions in future amendments to the
  plan may be implemented by t.he authority of the Director of the Administrative
  Office under Title 28, United States Code, §604, and that, therefore, any further
  changes in the plan need not be passed upon by the Conference unless the
  Committee on Court Administration feels that such Conference action would be
  necessary.


Judiciary Salary Plan
   In 1960 the Judicial Conference approved the Judiciary Salary
Plan covering positions in clerks' offices, probation offices and
bankruptcy offices. Technically, the qualification and classifica­
tion standards for other positions such as the judge's personal
staff, other court staff and magistrate's staff are not part of the
plan. In order that all supporting personnel positions in the
judiciary may be known as and be part of the judiciary salary plan
the Conference approved the following resolution:
     That the entire compensation system for positions in the judicial branch of the
   federal government, established by the Director of the Administrative Office,
   under the supervision and guidance of the Judicial Conference of the United
   Slates under title 28, United States Code §604(a)(5 land any future similar statutes
   shall be known as and part of the Judiciary Salary Plan.

Court Reporters
   The Conference approved a recommendation made in the
course of the presentation of the Budget Committee report that
the Court Administration Committee study the broad question of
court reporter needs in the district courts, including the current
limitation of one reporter for each judge regardless of certain
situations created by exceptionally long trials.
                                    LEGISLATION

S. 	3153 - Jurisdictional Amount in Federal Question and
      Diversity Cases
     The Conference noted that the Senate Judiciary Committee
had requested its views on S. 3153, a bill "to amend Sections 1331
and 1332 of title 28, United States Code, to increase the
jurisdictional amount in federal question and diversity cases from
$10,000 to $25,000." The Conference approved the proposal to
increase the jurisdictional amount in diversity cases to $25,000
and, if the jurisdictional amount in federal question cases is to be
retained, that the amount should also be increased to $25,000 as a
matter of consistency.
                                 41 

S. 2255 - Patent Law Revision
  The Conference noted that a Senate-passed bill, S. 2255,
relating to the revision of the patent laws, would affect the
jurisdiction of the United States Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals and the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia. The Conference is of the view that passage of such
legislation would not only increase the volume of litigation
regarding the decisions of the Patent Office but would transfer
cases from the docket of the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals, a court which is current and fully qualified to process
this type of litigation, to the District Court and the Court of
Appeals in the District of Columbia which are already burdened
with other litigation. The Conference, therefore, agreed to
recommend to the Congress that the legislation be amended to
assure that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals will
continue to handle most patent appeal cases. Should the bill not
be so amended, the Conference agreed to recommend to the
Congress that the appropriate judicial and supporting resources
to process this litigation be provided forthwith to the United
States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals in
the District of Columbia.
H.R. 11315 - Foreign Soverign Immunities Act
   The Conference noted that H.R. 11315, a bill to define the
jurisdiction of the United States courts in suits against foreign
states, in Section 2 would amend Chapter 85 of title 28, United
States Code, by adding at the beginning thereof a new section
1330 pertaining to the jurisdiction of the district courts in actions
against foreign states. The Conference agreed that this section
might more appropriately be placed at the end of the chapter so
that it would not precede the general grant of jurisdiction in
federal question and diversity cases. The Conference was further
of the view that the proposed new subsection (f) of Section 1391
should be similar to the language contained in Section 1391(a).
Foreign Service Act of 1946
  The Office of Management and Budget requested the views of
the Conference on a draft bill to amend the Foreign Service Act to
provide protection to medical personnel of the State Department
against certain malpractice suits. After reviewing the proposed
legislation, the Conference agreed with the view of its Committee
that the bill would have no impact on the federal judiciary.
                                 42 

S. 3392 and H.R. 14016 - Judicial Review of Veterans' Claims
  The Conference voted its disapproval of S. 3392 and H.R.
14016, identical bills to provide for the judicial review of
administrative detenninations of the Veterans Administration.
The Conference noted that in the period from 1962 to 1967 it had
considered various proposals to provide judicial review of
decisions involving the claims of veterans and had consistently
disapproved such legislation. The Conference was advised that
approximately 45,000 notices of disagreement with awards of
veterans' benefits are now filed annually with the Veterans
Administration and that the Board of Veterans Appeals processes
26,000 cases each year. The Conference agreed that this legislation
would have a substantial impact on the workload of the federal
courts.
S. 2387 - Petroleum Industry Competition Act
   The Conference expressed no view on the substantive provi­
sions of this legislation but was in agreement in opposing the cre­
ation of a new court to be known as the Temporary Petroleum In­
dustry Divestiture Court composed of three or more judges to be
designated by the Chief Justice from the courts of appeals and the
district courts. The Conference was of the view that it would be
preferable to provide adequate resources for the district courts and
courts of appeals so that litigation arising under legislation of
this type may be processed in the nonnal way. Experience in the
assignment of judges to serve on special courts has shown how
disruptive and time-consuming this procedure can be. The
Conference suggested that the Congress undertake to ascertain the
impact of this legislation on the courts from persons familiar
with the scope of the bill and to provide the necessary resources to
the judiciary to cope with the anticipated caseload in advance of
its effective date.
S. 12 - Judicial Survivors Annuity Act
  Subsequent to the last session of the Conference which had
endorsed amendments to the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act as
reported by the Senate Subcommittee, several provisions of the
bill were amended, one of which would require an increase in the
contribution of judges from three percent to 4.5 percent of their
salaries. As so amended, the bill passed the Senate on June 22,
1976. The Conference agreed that the bill as passed would
materially strengthen the Judicial Survivors Annuity System by
                                          43 


placing the fund on a sound actuarial basis and would
substantially increase the benefits accruing to widows and
surviving dependent children of judges. Through its Executive
Committee the Conference approved several amendments pro­
posed by the House Judiciary Committee. The Conference
endorsed this action and requested the Chief Justice to urge upon
the Judiciary Committee prompt action in the House of
Representatives to assure passage of this legislation in th~ 94th
Congress.
S. 2408 - Judicial Review of Agency Proceedings
   The Conference noted a request by Senator Kennedy for an
early expression of its views on S. 2408, a bill "to improve the
administrative process by making federal agencies more respon­
sive to the will of the people as expressed by their elected
representatives in Congress." The Conference noted that the bill
would provide de novo review by the court of all relevant
questions of law and would provide that the court in review shall

      JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE CODE OF JUDICIAL
                     CONDUCT
  The Report of the Joint Committee was presented by Judge
Edward A. Tamm, who with Judge Elbert P. Tuttle is co­
Chairman of the Committee.
  The Conference considered the request of the Radio Television
News Directors Association that the photographing and broad­
casting of ceremonial matters and naturalization proceedings be
permitted in federal courtrooms and voted against a change in
Canons of Judicial Ethics to permit such photographing and
broadcasting.
      ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES
  Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman, reported that in the last six
months the Committee had received eighteen formal inquiries
compared with seventeen in the prior six-month period. At its
summer meeting the Committee considered eleven inquiries
which could not be resolved through correspondence or which
were received just prior to the meeting. Judge Tuttle also reported
that, pursuant to an earlier resolution of the Conference, the
Federal Judicial Center has included the subject of judicial ethics
in its seminars for newly-appointed judges.
      COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY 

                     SYSTEM 

  The report of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury
System was presented by the Chairman, Judge Arthur J. Stanley,
Jr.
                            ExCUSE BECAUSE OF DISTANCE

  The Conference approved draft legislation for transmittal to
the 95th Congress which would repeal 28 U.S.c. 1863 (b) (7),
removing the authority to excuse prospective jurors from service
automatically on the basis of a given distance from their residence
                                            45 


to the court and thus requiring the determination of requests for
excuse based upon distance to be made on an individual case-by­
case basis. The Conference agreed with the view of the Committee
that the district courts should not single out residents of certain
portions of the district for prospective avoidance of jury service by
establishing in their jury selection plans specific mileage or travel
distances as a basis for automatic excuse from service. While the
Conference agreed that the adoption of this proposal might cause
some increase in cost, it was not believed that this increase would
have more than a minor impact upon the over-all annual
financial outlay for fees and expenses of jurors.

       JUROR FEE INCREASE AND EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION

   The Conference reaffirmed its support of legislation which
would raise the daily jury attendance fee from $20 to $30 and
which would equate the allowable travel and necess;ary subsist­
ence expenses of jurors to the rates established by the Director of
the Administrative Office for supporting court personnel in travel
status. The Conference further reaffirmed its ~upport of
legislation to provide statutory protection for the employment
rights of federal jurors against termination because of their jury
service. The Director of the Administrative Office was authorized
to retransmit these proposals to the 95th Congress.

                       OTHER LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

   The Conference further noted that several bills which it had
previously endorsed relating to jury administration had failed of
action in the 94th Congress, and the Director of the Administra­
tive Office was authorized to transmit these proposals to the 95th
Congress in the form of an omnibus bill encompassing the
following proposals.
   (I) A bill to establish a presumption that the use of voter registration lists as the
         source of juror names is consistent with the policies of community cross­
         sectionality and nondiscrimination in the selection of federal juries
         (transmitted in draft form on May 21. 1976);
   (2) A bill 	to provide in civil cases for juries of six persons and to reduce the
         allowable peremptory challenges from three to two (pending as H.R. 6039
         and S. 237);
   (3) 	 A bill to amend the Federal Employees' Compensation Act by adding a new
         section providing for work injury coverage of federal petit and grand jurors
         in the performance of their duties (transmitted in draft form on March 24.
         1975);
   (4) A bill to clarify the qualification section of the Jury Selection and Service Act.
         28 U.S.C. §1865(b) (5). with regard to service by persons whose civil rights
                                           46 

       have been restored, by deleting the phrase "by pardon or "rnnesty" (pending
       as H.R. 6050);
   (5) A bill to add to the Jury Selection and Service Act further definitions relating
       to jury selection by electronic data processing (pending as H.R. 6051).


                           FREE PRESS - FAIR TRIAL

  The Conference agreed that the subject of guidelines is properly
within the cognizance of the Jury Committee and authorized the
Committee to continue its study of the existing guidelines with a
view to determining whether there is a need for further revision in
light of their differences from the recommendations of the
American Bar Association, as well as the decision of the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago Council of Lawyers v.
Bauer, 522 F.2d 242, which invalidated certain district court local
rules limiting attorney comment.

   COMMnTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

              CRIMINAL LAW 

 Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.

                            REGISTRATION OF FINES

   The Conference approved a draft bill to amend Section 1963 of
title 28, United States Code, to make it clear that a judgment of
fine in a sum certain entered in any district may be registered in
any other district. The Conference was advised that at present
thef(~ is a conflict in the district courts as to th.e applicability of
Section 1963 - some district courts view the statute as applying to
only civil judgments and others apply it to both civil and
criminal judgments.

   DISCLOSURE OF PRIOR STATEMENTS OF DEFENSE WITNESSES

  The Conference approved proposed legislation transmitted by
the Office of Managementand Budget which would amend title
18, United States Code, to provide for disclosure at trial of prior
statements of defense witnesses in the hands of the defense. The
Conference agreed with the members of the Committee who
regarded the disclosure of prior statements of defense witnesses as
promoting the concept of the trial as a search for the truth and
thus better serve the ends of justice.

               REVISION OF THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL CoDE

  Since it is expected that proposals for the revision of the Federal
Criminal Code such as was embodied in S. I and substantially
similar bills in the House of Representatives in the 94th Congress
will be reintroduced in the 95th Congress, the Conference agreed
to empower the Chairman of the Committee and such members as
he may designate with full authority to speak for the Committee
and the Conference at any Congressional committee hearings
which may be heard on this subject matter in the 95th Congress.
    COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

              BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

the judicial councils and the district judges, and took the

     STUDIES OF THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED I:-.r PROCESSING
                              BANKRUPTCY APPEALS

  The Conference was advised that at the request of the
Committee, the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office
had inquired into the manner in which district courts scheduled
hearings of appeals from Judgments or Orders from bankruptcy
judges. The majority of replies explained specific procedures such
as whether appeals were assigned to the district judges by lot,
alternately between judges or by sealed packet. The only
variations were:
      (I) Bankruptcy appeals assigned first to motion judge, who determines whether
   greater judicial effort is required; if so, under local rule he assigns the matter to a
   district judge and, if not, decides the appeal as a motion.
      (2) In four districts, all bankruptcy cases are assigned to a United States district
   judge when filed. That judge then gets the appeal. This practice is contrary to the
   intent of Bankruptcy Rule of Procedure 102, which provides that, on the filing of
   a bankruptcy case, the district court clerk should refer the case forthwith to a
   referee, and thereafter all procedures shall be before the referee. The second
   paragraph of this rule provides that a district judge may, for the convenience of
   the parties or for cause, withdraw a case or part of a case from the referee.
      (3) The clerk assigns a civil number to the bankruplCY appeal and processes the
   case accordingly, This also is contrary to instructions issued by the Administra·
   tive Office.


   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
             PROBATION SYSTEM
  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Probation System was presented by the Chairman, Judge Albert
C. Wollenberg.

         AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT

  The Conference approved a draft bill to amend the Federal Tort
Claims Act to include pretrial services officers with the definition
of law enforcement officer, thereby providing an administrative
route for resolution of claims against such officers in the areas of
assault, false imprisonment, and the like. Judge Wollenberg
reported that the lO pretrial service agencies have processed
approximately 5,000 cases, and that the staffs of the 10 agencies
now include 94 professional and 37 clerical positions. The
                                  53 

Committee has endorsed the establishment of a petty cash fund of
$150 to $300 depending on the size of the agency to cover minor
cash expenses of released defendants.
  At its March 1975 meeting the Conference approved guidelines
for the carrying of firearms by probation officers. The Committee
has advised the Director of the Administrative Office he should
not be required to purchase ammunition necessary for required
training.



    COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS



   Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman of the Committee on
Intercircuit Assignments, reported to the Conference on assign­
ments covering the period from February 15 to August 15, 1976.
   During this period the Committee recommended 47 assign­
ments to be undertaken by 39 judges. Of this number, four are
senior circuit judges, seven are active circuit judges, six are district
judges in active status and 16 are senior district judges. One
retired Supreme Court Justice participated in four assignments.
Eight assignments involved one active judge from the Court of
Claims, two active judges from the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals and two active judges of the Customs Court.
   Four senior circuit judges, seven senior district judges, and one
retired Supreme Court Justice carried out 16 of the 30 assignments
 to the circuit courts of appeals which were recommended during
 this period. Seven active circuit judges, two active district judges,
 two active judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and
one active judge of the Court of Claims participated in the other
 14 assignments to the courts of appeals.
   Of the 17 assignments to the district courts, nine senior district
judges participated in ten assignments, the remaining seven being
carried out by four active district judges and two active judges of
the United States Customs Court.
   In addition to the foregoing, the Committee recommended and
the Chief Justice approved an interchange of assignments
between the seven active judges of the United States Court of
Claims and the five active judges of the United States Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals to cover any emergency which
might arise during the period April 1, 1976 and March 31, 1977.

salaries of those full-time magistrate positions now fixed at
$31,500 to $37,800.
    STANDARD SALARY LEVELS FOR PART-TIME MAGISTRATES

   In order to achieve consistency among magistrates having
similar caseloads both within a district and nationally, the
Conference in March 1975 (Con£. Rept., p. 31) approved a
schedule of standard salary levels for part-time magistrates. The
Conference agreed to the recommendations of the Committee to
adopt the following changes in the existing schedule of salary
levels, as follows:
      1. Eliminate the present levels of $387, $996, $1.661 and $2,325 and adjust the
   salaries of the part-time magistrates who are now at those levels to the next higher
   respective levels, effective December I, 1976;
     2. Add a new level of $12,500 to fill the gap between the present $11,079 and
   $13,959 levels;
     3. Add new levels at $17,300 and $18,900, subject to the enactment of S. 2923.

                   CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

  The Conference approved the recommendations of the
Committee for the authorization of five new full-time positions,
the conversion of four part-time positions to full-time positions,
authorization of one new combination position, conversion of
one part-time position to a combination position, discontinuance
of five part-time positions, the increase in salaries of 12 part-time
positions and one combination position and continuation of two
full-time positions, two combination positions and 25 part-time
positions for new terms of office.
  The Conference approved the following changes in magistrate
positions and salaries after receiving the recommendations of the
Administrative Office, the district courts, the judicial councils of
the circuits, as well as the Committee, to be made effective when
appropriated funds are available:

limitation of $1,000 in felony cases. The largest single factor in
                                       59 

the costs of transcripts, expert and other services has been in the
cost of transcripts. The cost of operating the 22 federal defender

  The Conference approved a supplemental grant to the
C...ommunity Defender Organization for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania for fiscal year 1977 in the amount of $4,000 to cover
additional unanticipated rental expenses.
        PAROLE CoMMISSION AND REORGANIZATION ACT

  The Conference was advised that it was the Committee's
opinion that financially eligible parolees in parole revocation
proceedings are entitled to counsel under the Criminal Justice
Act. As to counsel appointed in parole termination proceedings
under 18 USc. 4211(c) an opinion has been sought from the
C...omptroller General to resolve the existing doubt as to the
applicability of the Act.
                                 GUIDELINES
  The Conference approved an addition to Chapter II, A, I, d, of
the Guidelines for the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act
in order to provide clearly for the appointment of counsel for
persons proposed by the United States Attorney for placement in a
pretrial diversion program, as follows:
   (3) 	 Counsel may be appointed for financially eligible persons proposed by
         the U.S. Attorney for processing under a "pretrial diversion" program.
         Such an appointment is deemed to be under the general terms of the Act
         rather than subsection (g), and should be considered an appointment in
         a felony or misdemeanor case in accordance with the offense alleged by
         the U.S. Attorney to have been violated,

                  CRIMINAL PRACTICE MANUAL

  The Conference was advised that an advisory commi ttee
consisting of experienced public defenders had completed a basic
federal criminal practice manual for use by all who represent
defendants under the Criminal Justice Act. The Administrative
Office will assume responsibility for the printing and distribution
of the manual. It is intended that the manual will be provided at
no cost to each federal judge and to all attorneys, including
federal defenders, who are subject to appointment under the
Criminal Justice Act. Copies will also be made available to others
on request at a cost not to exceed $5.00.

             SEMIANNUAL REPORT OF EXCESS PAYMENTS

  At the April 1972 session of the Judicial Conference (ConL
Rept., p. 21) a motion was made and carried requiring the
                                 61 

Administrative Office to determine on a quarterly basis the names
of attorneys appointed under the Act who during that quarter
were paid more than $1,000 and report such facts to the chief
judges of the circuits involved. At the October 1972 session this
resolution was modified to require a report to the chief judges of
both the circuit and district courts on a semiannual basis of
attorneys receiving more than $6,000 (Conf. Rept., p. 54). This
requirement was imposed in order to test the adequate function­
ing of the rotation system for the appointment of counsel.
Experience has indicated that the chief judges of the circuits are
aware of the appointments made since they must personally
approve excess compensation and that few districts appear to
assign a large number of cases to the same attorney. Accordingly,
 the Conference approved a further modification of the 1972
resolution to provide for an annual report to the chief judges of
 the circuit and district courts of attorneys appointed under the Act
who receive in excess of $12,000 during the reporting year.

       COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                  PROCEDURE 

  The report of the Committee on Rules of Practice and
Procedure was presented by the Chairman, Judge Roszel C.
Thomsen.

   The Conference was advised that on April 26, 1976, the Su­
preme Court, pursuant to the recommendation made at the
September 1975 session (Conf. Rept., p. 76), approved the rules
and forms governing proceedings under Chapter VIII and IX of
the Bankruptcy Act and rules and forms amending certain rules
and forms previously prescribed pursuant to Chapters I through
VII, XI and XIII of the Bankruptcy Act. These rules became
effective on August 1, 1976 and thus completed the work of the
Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules which has been
discharged with an expression of appreciation by the Conference
for the Committee's achievement.
                          CRIMINAL RULES

   On April 26, 1976, the Supreme Court also approved and
transmitted to the Congress amendments to certain of the rules of
criminal procedure, as well as the rules and forms governing
Section 2254 cases in the United States district courts and the rules
                                          62 

and forms governing Section 2255 proceedings in the United
States district courts.
  Judge Thomsen advised that the Congress subsequently
enacted legislation approved by the President on July 8, 1976, as
Public Law 94-349, changing the effective date of certain of the
rules and amendments as follows:
       1. The amendments to Rules 6(e), 23, 24, 40.1 and 4!(c)(2) of the Rules of
   Criminal Procedure shall not take effect until August I, 1977, or until and to the
   extent approved by Act of Congress, whichever is earlier;
       2. The remaining amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure, namely
   amendments to Rules 6(f), 41(a), 41(c)(l). and 50(b) are not changed by Public
   Law 94·349 and hence shall become effective August I, 1976, as set forth in the
   Order of the Supreme Court of April 26, 1976.

  On September 28, 1976, the President signed as Public Law 94­
426 legislation changing in certain respects rules and forms
relating to 2254 and 2255 proceedings as embraced in the Order of
the Supreme Court of April 26, 1976, and stipulated that these
rules shall become effective on February 1, 1977.
                            REVIEW OF SENTENCES

  Judge Thomsen advised the Conference that the Advisory
Committee on Criminal Rules and the Standing Committee had
approved a proposed Rule 35.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure which is to be circulated to the bench and bar on or
about October I, 1976, for further comment.
   The rule proposes, in general, review of sentences in the court
of appeals involving (a) the filing of a petition for leave to appeal;
(b) the screening of such petitions by a three-judge panel of the
court of appeals, which panel may include one or two district
judges as each circuit may decide and (c) if the screening panel
decides that a showing has been made of a substantial basis fot
believing that the sentence is clearly unreasonable, the panel shall
grant a petition and the court of appeals shall thereaftel
determine whether the sentence is clearly unreasonable.
                   BICENTENNIAL COMMITTEE
  Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., Chairman, submitted a
written report to the Conference outlining the four ongoing
projects of the Bicentennial Committee, as follows:
  (1) The Committee has contracted with Metropolitan Pitts­
burgh Public Broadcasting, Inc., for the production of five 30­
minute films and a 90-minute special feature film, focusing on
early decisions that were significant in the development of this
                                63 


country's federal system. The Committee has approved the five
scripts for the short films. After some delay, production begins
next week and the movies are expected to be available for
distribution in the spring of 1977. The special film will be shown
during prime time on the Public Broadcasting Stations at
approximately the same time;
   (2) Professor Sidney Hyman of the University of Illinois is
working on a projected popular book intended for use primarily
by the lay people and focusing on the roles of the courts in the
federal system.
  (3) In February the Committee distributed biographical
questionaires to all members of the federal judiciary as one step
in the production of a biographical directory of all federal judges,
past and present. As of this time, over 400 judges have returned
their completed questionnaires and questionnaires continue to
arrive daily at the Bicentennial Committee's offices.
  (4) The circuits have the option of preparing a history of the
courts in their geographic area. The Committee will consider
providing up to $5,000 to each circuit for the writing of its
history, upon submission of justification therefor. Thus fat, the
Committee has authorized varying amounts for preparation of
histories of the Third, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and
D.C. Circuits. The Bicentennial Committee is also aware that the
Second Circuit, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the
Court of Claims, and the Customs Court are preparing such
histories without requests for funds.
           PACIFIC TERRITORIES COMMITTEE
  In August 1976 the Chief Justice appointed Judge Richard H.
Chambers of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as Chairman of
an ad hoc committee to study and make such recommendations as
may be appropriate on the question of the court structure in the
Pacific Territories, with particular reference to the Territory of
American Samoa, the Territory of Guam, the· incoming
Commonwealth of Notthern Mariana and the Trust Territory of
the Pacific Islands as it will exist after the establishment of the
Commonwealth of Northern Mariana.
  Judge Chambers outlined to the Conference the historical
background and some of the problems that will be encountered in
the judicial systems of these four islands, particularly with
relation to the matter of appeal, either to the Supreme Court of
the United States or the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
                                64 


Judge Chambers pointed out that H.R. 4580, a bill pending in the
94th Congress relating to the Organic Act of Guam, requires
further study insofar as the judiciary is concerned and the
Conference agreed to request the Congress to defer consideration
of these problems until the 95th Congress so that the Committee
will have a further opportunity to report to the Conference at its
next session recommendations as to the structure of the judiciary
in Guam.
  It was agreed that further reports of this Committee will be
made through the Committee on Court Administration.
PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS
  The Conference approved the pretermission of terms of courts
of appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.c. 48, for all sessions of the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to be held outside of New Orleans,
Louisiana, and for the sessions of the Eighth Circuit Court of
Appeals to be held in Omaha, Nebraska, and Kansas City,
Missouri.
                          ELECTIONS
  The Conference noted that the Executive Committee, subse­
quent to the April session of the Conference, exercising the
plenary authority given by the Conference approved the election
of the Honorable John C. Godbold of the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit to be a member of the Board of the Federal Judicial
Center to fill the unexpired term of Griffin Bell who resigned and
the election of the Honorable Frank J. McGarr of the Northern
District of Illinois for a four-year term as a member of the Board
of the Federal Judicial Center, succeeding the Honorable Alfred
A. Arraj whose term had expired.
           RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
on matters considered at this session where necessary for
legislative action.
