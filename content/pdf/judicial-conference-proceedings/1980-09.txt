conference which shall be known as the Judicial Conference of the United States. Special
sessions of the conference may be called by the Chief Justice at such times and places as
he may designate.
   The district judge to be summoned from each judicial circuit shall be chosen by the
circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual judicial conference of the circuit held
pursuant to section 333 of this title and shall serve as a member of the conference for three
successive years. except that in the year following the enactment of this amended section
the judges in the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth circuits shall choose a district judge to
serve for one year, the judges in the second, fifth, and eighth circuits shall choose a district
judge to serve for two years and the judges in the third, sixth, ninth. and District of
Columbia circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for three years.
   If the chief judge of any circuit or the district judge chosen by the judges of the circuit
is unable to attend, the Chief Justice may summon any other circuit or district judge from
such circuit. If the chief judge of the Court of Claims or the chief judge of the Court of

   The conference shall also carry on a continuous study of the operation and effect of the
general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as prescribed by the
Supreme Court for the other courts of the United States pursuant to law. Such changes

              REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR 

           OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE 

           OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS 


   The Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts, William E. Foley, submitted to the Conference
the Annual Report of the Director for the year ended June
30, 1980. The Conference authorized the Director to release
the Annual Report immediately in preliminary form and to
revise and supplement the final printed edition.

              JUDICIAL BUSINESS OF THE COURTS

   The Director's report indicated that appeals docketed in
the United States courts of appeals during the year ended
June 30, 1980 increased 14.7 percent to a record-23,200 ap­
peals filed. This is almost twice the number of appeals filed
ten years ago and almost six times the number of appeals
filed in 1960. During the year the courts of appeals terminated
a record 20,887 appeals, 10.3 percent more than the number
terminated in the previous year, but 2,313 appeals less than
the number filed. As a result, the number of appeals pending
on June 30, 1980 increased almost 13 percent to a record
20,252 appeals.
   Civil cases filed in the United States district courts in the
year ended June 30, 1980 were 168,789, an increase of 9.1
percent over the 154,666 civil cases filed during the previous
year. There were 160,481 civil cases terminated during the
year compared with 143,323 cases terminated during the
previous year. On June 30, 1980 there were 186,113 civil
cases pending on the dockets of the district courts, an in­
crease of 4.7 percent over the 177,805 civil actions pending a
year earlier.
                               64 



    Criminal cases filed in the district courts in 1980 declined
for the third successive year to 28,921, a decrease of 11.5
percent compared with the 32,688 criminal cases filed during
the previous year. There were 29,297 criminal cases termi­
nated, a 12.4 percent decrease from the previous year, but
376 cases more than the number filed. As a result, the
number of criminal cases pending on June 30, 1980 fell to an
eleven-year low of 14,759.
   During the year there were 277,804 bankruptcy cases, in­
volving 360,960 separate estates, filed in the United States
bankruptcy courts. The total number of estates constitutes a
numerical increase of 134,484, or 59.4 percent more than the
previous year total, and an increase of 106,476 estates, or
41.8 percent, over the previous record number of bankruptcy
filings in 1975. During the year there were 189,667 estates
closed and on June 30, 1980 there were 429,461 estates to be
administered in 346,385 pending cases.


                 JUDICIAL PANEL ON 

              MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION 


   In its written statement filed with the Conference the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation reported that during
the year ending June 30, 1980 the Panel had acted upon
1,386 civil actions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1407 and that 1,260
actions were centralized for coordinated or consolidated pre­
trial proceedings. The Panel denied transfer of 126 actions.
Since the creation of the Panel 9,164 civil actions have been
centralized in pretrial proceedings in carrying out the Panel's
responsibilities. As of June 30, 1980, almost 6,500 of those
actions had been remanded for trial or terminated by settle­
ment or dismissal in the transferee courts.


               REPORT OF THE 

       COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH 


  Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman of the Committee on
the Judicial Branch, reported on the activities of the Com­
mittee since its appointment last January.
                                 65 



       Judge Kaufman stated that the Committee's charter is
    broadly based and reaches to problems of the Federal bench
    not directly addressed by other Conference committees. Spe­
    cifically, the Committee is charged with the responsibility of
    devising methods for informing the other branches of the
    Federal government, news media, members of the bar, and
    citizens in general, of the role of the Federal Judiciary in
    American society; bringing to public attention the needs of
    the Federal courts and the problems they face in discharging
    their obligations; and encouraging and promoting such re­
    forms in court administration and procedure, and in the
    nature and the challenge of Federal judicial service, as may
    tend to improve the administration of justice throughout the
    judiciary.
       The Committee is currently focusing its attention on the
    problem of inadequate compensation, anticipating the crea­
    tion, on October 1, 1980, of the Quadrennial Commission on
    Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries, 2 U.S.C. 351 et
    seq. The Committee has begun to compile extensive informa­
    tion on the need for increasing judicial compensation for
    presentation to the Commission. Committees of the American
    Bar Association and the American College of Trial Lawyers
    have been appointed and will independently assist in this
    work. The Committee will also explore the adequacy of cur­
    rently authorized survivor's annuities, per diem, and life and
    health insurance benefits.
       At the suggestion of Judge Kaufman, the Conference
    authorized the distribution of the Committee's report to all
    Federal judges for their information.


         COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION

      Judge Elmo B. Hunter, Chairman of the Committee on
    Court Administration, presented the report of the Committee.

                       ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS
I

      The Conference received the comprehensive survey report
    on the need for additional judgeships in the United States
    courts of appeals and the United States district courts
                                            66



prepared by the Subcommittee on Iudicial Statistics. As a
result of the survey and upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee, the Conference voted to recommend to Congress the

   The Director of the Administrative Office was authorized
to transmit the recommendations of the Conference to the
97th Congress together with reasons and justifications. The
statement of justification is to be developed with the Chair­
man of the Committee.

       TRAVEL REGULATIONS FOR JUSTICES AND JUDGES

  The Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts had previously submitted to the Committee
proposed new travel regulations for justices and judges of the
United States, which are required to be approved by the
Conference pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 456. Judge Hunter in­
formed the Conference that the Committee had conducted a
detailed review of the regulations, made several changes
therein and recommended that the regulations, as amended,
be approved by the Conference. The Conference thereupon
approved the draft regulations and authorized the Director
of the Administrative Office to issue them immediately.

                       SPACE ACQUISITION

   In view of the need to have adequate space in court build­
ings upon the arrival of additional personnel, particularly
judges who replace senior judges, the Conference adopted the
following resolution:
                                 68


      That all judges are encouraged to notify the Administrative
    Office as early as possible, as to when they intend to take
    senior status in order to enable the Administrative Office to
    commence the process of obtaining sufficient space to accom­
    modate both the senior judge and his or her successor. If
    desired. notification may be on a confidential basis.
      The Administrative Office is authorized to currently re­
    quisition from the General Services Administration reasonably
    anticipated space needs for the courts, even though the oc­
    cupancy may not occur immediately.

                  COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION

  The Judicial Council of the Third Circuit had requested a
waiver of the space limitations for the design of a new court­
house in Newark, New Jersey. The Committee concluded that
the present space guidelines for courtrooms and chambers
are sufficient to provide the court with its needs and that to
deviate from the guidelines would set an undesirable prece­
dent. Further, the Committee was of the view that additional
space should not be provided for law student interns. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference denied
the request for a waiver.

                MISCELLANEOUS FEE SCHEDULES

   The Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1913, 1914,
and 1930(b) and Sec. 40c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act approved
the changes in the miscellaneous fee schedules for the courts
of appeals, district courts, and bankruptcy courts, previously
approved by the Conference, to provide that the fee for the
reproduction of an audio tape recording also apply to a video
tape recording. The items in the various fee schedules per­
taining to the reproduction of magnetic tape recordings were
amended to read as follows:
    For reproduction of magnetic tape recordings, either cassette
    or reel to reel, $2.00 plus the cost of materials, minimum
    charge of $5.00.
   The Conference, pursuant to Section 40c(3) of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, also amended the schedule of miscellaneous fees
to reduce the fee for filing a notice of appeal in a case arising
under the Bankruptcy Act from $10 to $5, so that it will coin­
                                   69 



cide with the fee required for filing a notice of appeal in a
case arising under the new Bankruptcy Code 28 U.S.C.
1930(c). The following item was added to the fee schedule:
    10. Upon the filing of a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy
    court in a proceeding arising under the Bankruptcy Act. $5.00
    should be paid to the clerk of the bankruptcy court by the
    appellant.
   In order that all charges and fees promulgated by the Con­
ference pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1930(b) and Sec. 40c(3) of the
Bankruptcy Act be made uniform, the Conference, upon
recommendation of the Committee, directed that the claims
processing fee previously prescribed for cases under the
Bankruptcy Act be added, with some minor modification,
to the bankruptcy court schedule of fees as follows:
    11. For clerical processing of each claim filed in excess of 10,
    $.25 each in asset cases filed under Chapters I-VII of the
    Bankruptcy Act and in cases filed under the relief chapters
    of the Bankruptcy Act.
    The Conference directed that the foregoing amendments of
the various miscellaneous fee schedules become effective
October 15, 1980.
   The Conference also ratified the action taken by the
Executive Committee of the Conference in changing Item 7 of
the schedule of fees in bankruptcy cases, making the fee for
filing a complaint in a pending bankruptcy case the same as
the fee for filing a civil proceeding in a district court, and
eliminating the requirement that a debtor pay a fee for filing
a separate complaint in a pending bankruptcy case in addi­
tion to the fee already paid for filing the bankruptcy petition.
The change in Item 7 of the fee schedule, which became ef­
fective July 1, 1980 by action of the Executive Committee, is
as follows:
    7. For filing a complaint, a fee should be collected in the
    same amount as the filing fee prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 1914(a)
    for instituting any civil action other than a writ of habeas
    corpus. If the United States, other than a United States
    trustee acting as a trustee in a case under Title 11, or a debtor
    is the plaintiff, no fee is required. If a trustee in a case under
    Title 11 is the plaintiff, the fee should be payable only from
    the estate and to the extent there is any estate realized. The
    exemption granted herein to a debtor is not granted to a
    debtor in possession.

              ASSISTANTS TO CIRCUIT ExECUTIVES

   The Conference, in September 1979, approved an item in
the budget for the Judiciary for the fiscal year 1981 to provide
for 15 assistants to circuit executives to serve as court
executives for metropolitan district courts having 10 or more
judges. In March 1980 (Conf. Rept., p. 23) the Conference
adopted a resolution specifying that these court executives
would be "selected by and be subject to the direction of the
judges of the district court for the relevant district in accor­
dance with the selection procedures provided in 28 U.S.C.
332." In considering this request the Appropriations Com­
mittees of the Congress expressed some concern with regard
to the authority for these positions and suggested the need for
specific authorizing legislation. Upon recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference authorized the Director of the
Administrative Office to transmit to the 97th Congress pro­
posed legislation, submitted by the Committee, which would
expressly authorize these positions to serve the district courts.

                  PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

  S.2432 and H.R.6971, 96th Congress, would transfer two
counties from one division to another within the Eastern
District of Missouri. The legislation had previously been
recommended by both the district court and the Judicial
Council of the Eighth Circuit. The Conference thereupon
recommended the enactment of this legislation.

                    JUDICIARY SALARY PLAN

    The Administrative Office of the United States Courts had
 recommended amending the Judicial Salary Plan to eliminate
 the "journeyman level rule", requiring one year of service at
 the next lower grade in a position in order to qualify for the
,top grade of that position, and the substitution of specialized
 experience requirements appropriate to the work involved.
 The Committee recommended approval of the concept of
 specialized experience requirements in lieu of the "journey­
 man level rule" and further recommended that the Con­
 ference approve the use of the primary qualification standards
 set forth in the new standards to eliminate the need for sub­
                               71



mitting qualification standards for specific positions to the
Conference each time new standards are developed. The Con­
ference approved the recommendation of the Committee.

                    SECRETARIES TO JUDGES

   Judge Hunter informed the Conference that the salary
limits and qualification standards for secretaries to all court
officers, which were recently revised, should be further re­
vised to make them consistent with standards for other posi­
tions. The Committee specifically recommended that the
standards for judges' secretaries be amended to increase the
requirement of quantity of experience for each grade level by
one additional year of general experience and to eliminate
the "journeyman level rule" as a criterion at grade JSP-10.
The qualification requirements for grade JSP-11 would not
be changed. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.

         PROBATION OFFICER TREATMENT SPECIALIST

   Beginning with the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of
1966 and culminating with the recent transfer of responsi­
bility for contract drug treatment services from the Bureau of
Prisons to the probation service. the work of probation of­
ficers in the treatment of drug and alcohol dependent of­
fenders has developed into a sophisticated and specialized
form of work requiring specialized training. Upon recom­
mendation of the Committee, the Conference adopted new
classification and qualification standards for a probation of­
ficer position (Drug and Alcohol Treatment Specialist) at
grade JSP-13.

                 SENIOR PROBATION OFFICERS

  In view of the changes that have occurred in the Federal
Probation Service in recent years and recognizing that some
nonsupervisory probation officers are performing service at a
high level, the Committee recommended the creation of a
new Senior Probation Officer position at grade JSP-13. A
probation officer at this level would typically serve as a senior
                               72 



officer, handling the most difficult cases, developing district­
wide programs, or serving as a leader of a team of line pro­
bation officers. The Committee indicated that the volume of
this high level, nonsupervisory work available in a probation
office would preclude more than approximately 25 percent of
the line probation officers from being considered as senior
officers. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference approved the classification and qualification stan­
dards for a Senior Probation Officer at grade JSP-13.

                 DEPUTY CLERKS-FINANCIAL

   The Administrative Office has recently delegated additional
responsibility to financial deputy clerks in district courts, in­
cluding the responsibility for fiduciary control over funds
deposited with the court and responsibility for disbursement
of appropriated funds. Because these functions impose ad­
ditional responsibilities and personal liability on financial
deputies, the Committee recommended that the grade range
of financial deputies, who have actually been delegated and
perform the full range of financial functions in district courts,
be raised from JSP-8-9-10 to JSP-9-1O-11. The Committee
also recommended that the Director of the Administrative
Office be required to develop and promulgate standards
based on the scope of financial functions handled and the
degree of independent judgment to be exercised, and further
to determine whether this increase in grade range should
apply to any financial deputies in bankruptcy courts. This
recommendation was approved by the Conference.

            DEPUTY CLERKS-JURY ADMINISTRATION

  Changes in the duties and responsibilities of deputy clerks
in charge of jury administration, including those imposed by
the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, have increased
the complexity of the work involved. The Committee ac­
cordingly recommended that the grade range for deputy
clerks, who are in fact acting as jury administrators and
managing all aspects of the jury system, be increased to
JSP-8-9-10 and that the Director of the Administrative Office
develop and promulgate standards for distinguishing those
                              73 



positions to be increased to the new grade range from those
which will remain at the JSP-6-7-8 level. This recommenda­
tion was also approved by the Conference.
   All recommendations approved by the Conference at this
session for changes in grade structure and the creation of
new types of positions were made subject to the availability of
funds.

                      INCENTIVE AWARDS
  The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee,
approved the transmission to Congress of draft legislation
authorizing the granting of incentive awards to employees in
the Judicial Branch of the Government.

      QUALIFICATION STANDARDS FOR CLERKS OF COURT
   Judge Hunter submitted to the Conference proposed stan­
dards and procedures for the selection of clerks of courts of
appeals, district courts, and bankruptcy courts, together with
standard job announcements to be used by courts of appeals
and district courts in publicizing a search for candidates. The
bankruptcy courts would use the district court announcement
as a guide. Upon recommendation of the Committee the
Conference approved the qualification standards and selec­
tion procedures and the job announcements submitted by the
Committee.


             COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET

  Chief Judge Robert E. Maxwell, Chairman of the Com­
mittee on the Budget, presented the report of the Committee.

 SUPPLEMENTAL ApPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1981
   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee,
authorized the Director of the Administrative Office to sub­
mit to the Congress requests for supplemental appropriations
for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, for "pay costs"
and for the implementation of any new legislation, actions of
                              74 



the Judicial Conference, or for any other reason he considers
necessary and appropriate.

        BUDGET EsTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR       1982
   The Conference approved the budget estimates for the
fiscal year 1982, prepared by the Director of the Administra­
tive Office and submitted by the Committee. The budget esti­
mates, exclusive of the Supreme Court, the Customs Court,
and the Federal Judicial Center, aggregate $706,289,000, an
increase of approximately $72,969,000 over the appropria­
tions for the fiscal year 1981. The Director was authorized to
amend the budget estimates because of new legislation, actions
of the Judicial Conference, or for any other reason the Director
considers necessary and appropriate.
   The budget estimates for the bankruptcy courts were ap­
proved subject to any adjustments that may be appropriate
with respect to the staffing requirements of the clerks' offices
based on the work measurement study currently underway
in the bankruptcy courts. In addition, the Director was
authorized to approve, on an ad hoc basis, the appointment
of full-time salaried court reporters for multi-judge bank­
ruptcy courts in lieu of contractual services if, in his judg­
ment, a full-time reporter can be fully utilized.
   Judge Maxwell informed the Conference of the necessity
to absorb the additional expenditures resulting from the in­
creased subsistence and mileage allowances, now authorized
by the Travel Expense Act. The Director of the Administra­
tive Office has been asked to reprogram resources to the ex­
tent possible to cover the additional travel costs during the
fiscal year 1981. The Director has also been asked to inform
the Judiciary of the mandate imposed by the Congress to
absorb the additional costs of the increased per diem and
other travel costs.

            JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY SYSTEM

  The Committee recommended the appointment of a new
committee, or an assignment to an existing committee, to
make a continuous study of the Judicial Survivors Annuity
System and to make recommendations for changes in the
                              75 



law. This function was assigned to the Committee on the
Judicial Branch.


             JUDICIAL ETHICS COMMITTEE

  Judge Edward A. Tamm, Chairman of the statutory Judicial
Ethics Committee, presented the report of the Committee.

                ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE

   Judge Tamm informed the Conference that the Committee
had received and reviewed 1,431 financial disclosure reports
covering the calendar year 1979 and that in addition the Com­
mittee had received and reviewed 40 reports required to be
filed by nominees to judgeship positions. All reports sub­
mitted to the Committee were reviewed by at least one Com­
mittee member to determine whether they were filed in a
timely manner, were complete, and were in proper form, as
required by 28 U.S.C.A. App. I, 306(a). In discharging its
responsibilities, the Committee writes letters to reporting in­
dividuals concerning errors appearing on the face of the
reporting form, sends followup letters to individuals who have
failed to file their reports within the time specified in the
statute, replies to all requests for extensions of time to file
reports, and sends letters to nominees to judicial positions
acknowledging receipt of their financial disclosure state­
ments. Since its last report to the Conference the Committee
has sent a total of 395 letters.
   As previously reported to the Conference, in May 1979 a
United States district judge in New Orleans enjoined the
public disclosure of financial disclosure forms. Subsequently
the decision of the district court was reversed on appeal, but
the issuance of the mandate of the court of appeals was stayed
pending disposition of an application for a writ of certiorari
filed in the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the order of the
district court remains in effect and the Committee is currently
not making any reports available to the public.
   The Conference was informed that 11 judicial officers and
employees had failed to file their reports for the calendar
year 1979. Two district judges have also failed to file their
                                   76 



reports for the calendar year 1978. Because of litigation now
pending before the Supreme Court regarding the public dis­
closure of financial statements, the Committee has not made
any reference to the Attorney General because of the failure
to file a report.


            REFERENCES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

   Judge Tamm stated that the Committee is required by 28
U.S.C.A. App. I, 304(b) to "refer to the Attorney General
the name of any individual the Committee has reasonable
cause to believe has willfully failed to file a report or has will­
fully falsified or failed to file information required to be
reported." Upon receipt of the reference the Attorney General
is authorized to bring a civil action against any such in­
dividual and the court may assess a civil penalty in an amount
not to exceed $5,000.
   Judge Tamm informed the Conference that the Committee
had adopted the following procedure for referring a matter
to the Attorney General and requested that it be included in
this report of Conference proceedings for the information of
those who are required to file financial disclosure statements.
        Upon failure to file a report, or upon failure to file a com­
     plete report, the Chairman on behalf of the Committee, will
     write a letter to the individual, requesting that a report be
     filed or that additional information be furnished to the Com­
     mittee and request a response within 30 days. If the individual
     fails to respond, the Committee will send a letter by certified
     mail, return receipt requested, asking whether or not the in­
     dividual will file the report or furnish the additional informa­
     tion requested. Upon failure to respond to the written inquiry,
     or refusal to furnish the information requested, copies of all
     correspondence will be sent to the Committee members. A
     reference to the Attorney General will be made only upon an
     affirmative vote of the entire Committee. The letter to the
     Attorney General will indicate that the reference has been
     made "at the direction of the Committee" and a copy of the
     reference will be sent to the individual.
   The Conference directed that when the Committee initiates
steps leading to a possible reference of a matter to the Attorney
General, the chief judge of the circuit and the chief judge of
                               77 



the appropriate district court receive copies of all cor­
respondence.
         REQUESTS TO INSPECT OR OBTAIN COPIES OF 

            FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS 


   A recent amendment to the Judicial Ethics Act of 1979, 28
U.S.C.A. App. I, 305(2), specifies that "a report may not be
made available under this section to any person or any copy
be provided under this section to any person except upon
written application. . ." The Conference, on recommendation
of the Committee, authorized the Director of the Administra­
tive Office to develop a standard form for such a written ap­
plication and distribute the form to all clerks of court who
desire to use it.
            POSITIONS HELD IN POLITICAL ENTITIES

   The Ethics in Government Act requires reporting individuals
to identify certain positions held in business enterprises, non­
profit organizations, labor organizations, and educational
institutions. Specifically excluded from the reporting require­
ments are positions held in any religious, social, fraternal, or
political entity and positions solely of an honorary nature.
   Applicable codes of conduct prohibit judges and judicial
employees from engaging in any political activity. In order
that it may discharge its responsibility of examining financial
disclosure reports to determine whether they reveal possible
violations of applicable conflict of interest laws and regula­
tions and recommending appropriate action to correct any
conflict of interest or ethical problems revealed by such a
review, the Committee recommended that the statute be
amended to require the disclosure of positions held in "political
entities." The Conference approved this recommendation and
authorized the Director of the Administrative Office to trans­
mit to the Congress legislation to amend section 302(a)(6) of
the Ethics in Government Act by deleting the reference to
"political entity."
    REPORTS OF PART·TIME UNITED STATES MAGISTRATES

  The March 1980 report of the Judicial Conference (Conf.
Rept., p. 23) indicates that part-time United States magistrates
                                  78 



in salary levels 1 through 7 are not required to file financial
disclosure statements since "they are not reasonably expected
to perform the duties of [their] office or position for more
than 60 days in a calendar year." It was the original intention
of the Committee that only those magistrates in salary levels
1 through 6 should not be required to file financial disclosure
statements. The Conference thereupon amended its previous
action to conform to the intentions of the Committee.

             CONFIDENTIALITY OF REpORTED ITEMS

   Judge Tamm requested that the Committee be authorized
to develop a system to enable a reporting individual to re­
quest of the Judicial Ethics Committee that certain listed
items of a highly personal nature, unrelated to the duties of
the position held, and not involving an actual or potential
conflict of interest, not be publicly disclosed. A statutory
change may be required. The Conference authorized the
Committee to study the matter further and to submit a proposal
at a future date.

                    POLICY DETERMINATIONS

  The Committee reported that it has adopted the following
procedures governing reporting requirements.
       Requests to Inspect Reports. As a matter of policy, the
    Committee will not automatically notify a reporting individual
    of a request to inspect a financial disclosure report. Informa­
    tion will be furnished upon individual application.

      Federal Income Tax Returns. A federal income tax return
    does not contain all the information required to be disclosed
    by the Act. The Committee has rejected a request that an
    income tax return be filed in lieu of a financial disclosure
    statement.
      Other Substitute Report. The Committee has also rejected a
    suggestion that the statement "same as the report for the
    previous year" be considered an adequate substitute for filing
    a current statement.
      Bankruptcy Judges. A bankruptcy judge should file a copy
    of the financial disclosure statement with the clerk of the
    bankruptcy court and not with the clerk of the district court.
                                  79


        Tort Recoveries. The Committee, as a matter of policy,
     adopted the position that tort recoveries, disability compensa­
     tion, and veterans benefits are not income within the meaning
     of the Act and need not be reported on disclosure statements.
       Employees in Grade JSP-J6. All employees in grade JSP-16
     must file disclosure statements regardless of whether they are
     receiving the full salary authorized for that position.
      Conditional Filings. The filing of a statement on condition
    that an item appearing thereon not be disclosed is a failure
    to comply with the statute and is equivalent to nonfiling.
    Accordingly, statements so filed will be returned to the report­
    ing individuals.


                ADVISORY COMMITIEE ON 

                  CODESOFCONDUcr 


 Judge Howard T. Markey, Chairman ofthe Advisory Com­
mittee on Codes of Conduct, presented the report of the
Committee.

                  ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE

   Judge Markey reported that since its last report to the Con­
ference the Committee has received 31 inquiries from persons
subject to the various codes of conduct. The Committee has
completed action on 21 inquiries and is currently processing
the remainder. In the last six months the Committee has
published one advisory opinion relating to disqualification
and has approved fuur other advisory opinions for pUblication.
These four opinions relate to children of judges serving as
law clerks to other judges, making recommendations for
pardon, disqualification, and attendance at seminars.

                      MEMBERSHIP IN CLUBS

  The Conference, in March 1980, (Conf. Rept. p. 28) en­
dorsed the principle "that it is inappropriate for a judge to
hold membership in an organization that practices invidious
discrimination" and authorized the Committee to consider
whether the Conference should adopt a canon of judicial
                                 80 



ethics or take other action to further this principle. In view of
the desirability of parallel provisions in the Code of Judicial
Conduct for United States Judges and the American Bar
Association's Code of Judicial Conduct, the Committee was·
requested to consult with the appropriate committee of the
American Bar Association.
   Judge Markey reported that pursuant to these instructions
the Committee had corresponded with the American Bar
Association's Committee on Professional Responsibility and
with its Judges Advisory Group and that a representative of
the Committee met with the American Bar Association Com­
mittee and, in tum, a representative of that Committee met
with the members of the Advisory Committee. The subject
has also been brought to the attention of the Judicial Adminis­
tration Division by the American Bar Association's National
Center for Professional Ethics. Numerous communications
from various groups expressing views pro and con have been
received and transmitted to the three American Bar Asso­
ciation groups involved.
   Because of the time required to complete its work and be­
cause of changes in the membership of the American Bar
Committee, Judge Markey indicated that joint action with the
American Bar Association cannot be completed before
February 1982 at the earliest. Judge Markey further indicated
that a fundamental difference exists with respect to the ef­
fect of the codes on Federal and State judges, in that a code
violation by a State judge in some states may result in severe
formal sanctions by an enforcement body. This may indicate
that the desirable "parallelism" envisioned in the March
1980 resolution of the Conference may be either impossible
of total achievement or inadvisable in this particular
instance.
   The Committee reported that it would continue to pursue
the matter with the American Bar Association but is con­
cerned about the delay inherent in the procedures of the
American Bar Association. Upon recommendation of the
Committee the Conference took the following action:
       (1) Granted additional time to the Committee to complete
     action and to report on its compliance with the instructions
     contained in the March 1980 resolution;
                                   81 



       (2) Instructed the Committee to render an interim report at
    its March and September 1981 meetings;
      (3) Instructed the Committee to submit to the Conference
    at its March 1981 session a proposed addition to the com­
    mentary accompanying Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial
    Conduct to assist Federal judges in their efforts to comply with
    the principle pertaining to club membership adopted by the
    Conference. The draft commentary should be first circulated
    to all Federal judges for comment prior to its submission to
    the Conference.



        DISQUALIFICATION IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION

   The Committee expressed concern that the disqualification
statute, 28 U.S.C. 455, may be unduly restrictive and operate
contrary to the public interest in those occasional situations
in which an appearance is entered for a third party long after
protracted litigation has begun. While some grounds of dis­
qualification must occasion the recusal of a judge, even at
the cost of retrying major litigation, it was the Committee's
view that automatic disqualification may not be justified. The
Committee, therefore submitted draft legislation to add a
new subsection (0 to 28 U.S.C. 455 to read as follows:

         (0 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if any justice,
    judge, magistrate, or bankruptcy judge to whom a matter has
    been assigned would be disqualified, after substantial judicial
    time has been devoted to the matter, because of the ap­
    pearance, after the matter was assigned to him, of a party in
    which he individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor
    child residing in his household, has a financial interest (other
    than an interest that could be substantially affected by the
    outcome), a waiver of disqualification may be accepted from
    the parties; in the absence of waiver, disqualification is not
    required if the judge determines that the public interest in
    avoiding the cost of delay of reassignment outweighs any ap­
    pearance of impropriety arising from his continuing with the
    matter to completion.


   The Conference approved the draft legislation and autho­
rized its transmission to the Congress.
                               82


             CODE OF CONDUCT FOR LAW CLERKS
  The Conference instructed the Committee to prepare a
code of conduct for law clerks and to submit such a code for
approval at the next session of the Conference.
                   ATIENDANCE AT SEMINARS
  The question of judges accepting invitations to attend
seminars sponsored by private organizations was referred to
the Committee for further study and subsequent report to the
Conference.

   COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS

   The written report of the Committee on Intercircuit Assign­
ments, submitted by the Chairman, Senior Judge George L.
Hart, Jr., was received by the Conference.
   During the period February 16, 1980 through August 15,
1980 the Committee recommended 89 assignments to be
undertaken by 55 judges. Of this number seven were senior
circuit judges, three were active circuit judges, one was a senior
judge of the Court of Claims, seven were active judges of the
Court of Claims, four were active judges of the Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals, 25 were senior district judges,
six were active district judges and two were active judges of
the Customs Court.
   Thirty-two judges undertook 50 assignments to the courts
of appeals and 24 judges undertook 27 assignments to the
district courts. In addition one active district judge was as­
signed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, four
active judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals
were assigned to the Court of Claims, and seven active judges
of the Court of Claims were assigned to the Court of Customs
and Patent Appeals.

                COMMITTEE ON RULES OF 

               PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE 


  A report on the activities of the Committee on Rules of
Practice and Procedure and the various advisory committees
was presented by Senior Judge Roszel C. Thomsen.
                              83 



                       CRIMINAL RULES

   The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules met in July
1980 to consider the comments received on the proposed
amendments transmitted to the bench and bar for comment
in November 1979. The Committee, however, decided not to
forward any amendments to the Standing Committee at this
time. If the new Criminal Code now under consideration in
the Congress is approved, the Advisory Committee will review
the new Code to determine whether any other changes in the
rules may be required.
   Judge Thomsen reported that as of the date of the Con­
ference no final legislative action had been taken on the
amendments to the Federal Rules of Crhninal Procedure and
to the amendment to Rule 410 of the Evidence Rules, the
effective date of which was postponed by Congress until
December 1, 1980.

                     BANKRUPTCY RULES

   The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules is con­
tinuing the difficult task of preparing new rules under the
new Bankruptcy Code and has held two meetings since the
last session of the Conference. Proposed new rules will be
circulated to the bench and bar for comment as soon as
practicable.

                         CIVIL RULES

   The Advisory Committee on Civil Rules met in April 1980
and is scheduled to meet again in October. The Committee
is currently considering various drafts of amendments to the
civil rules, particularly those relating to pretrial procedure.

                    COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN

  The Chief Justice informed the Conference that Judge
Thomsen had voluntarily retired as Chairman of the Com­
mittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, after seven years
of service in that position. Chief Judge Edward T. Gignoux of
the District of Maine has been designated as the new Com­
mittee Chairman.
                                   84 



   The Chief Justice expressed his sincere appreciation to
Judge Thomsen for his dedicated service to the Conference
and to the Judiciary during these last seven years. The Con­
ference recognized Judge Thomsen by adopting the following
resolution:
       The Judicial Conference of the United States takes special
    note of the retirement on July 1, 1980, of Judge Roszel C.
    Thomsen as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
    Conference on Rules of Practice and Procedure. Appointed in
    1973, Judge Thomsen served as the second Chairman of this
    most important committee and guided its work wisely and
    effectively for seven years. For this service the Conference
    expresses its sincere and profound appreciation.
       The Conference also desires to recognize Judge Thomsen's
    other contributions to the work of the Conference and to ex­
    press its gratitude for dedicated service for the last twenty-five
    years. Few judges in the history of the Conference have been
    members of so many Conference committees.
       Judge Thomsen was the first district judge representative
    from the Fourth Circuit to serve as a Conference member and
    served consecutive three-year terms from 1958 to 1964. From
    1959 to 1973 he served as a member of the Advisory Com­
    mittee on Civil Rules; he was a member of the Coordinating
    Committee on Multiple Litigation from 1962 to 1968; the
    Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law from
    1971 to 1973; the Committee to Implement the Criminal
    Justice Act from 1964 to 1974 (and served as its Chairman
    from 1972 to 1974); and the Advisory Committee on Judicial
    Activities from 1969 to 1974. In 1974, Judge Thomsen was
    selected by the Chief Justice to serve as a Judge of the Special
    Court established under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act
    of 1973, a task to which he is now dedicated.
       On the occasion of this retirement from active participation
    in the work of its committees, the Conference expresses warm
    wishes to Judge Thomsen for many years of continued judicial
    service in good health and vigor.


        COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION 

           OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM 


  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Probation System was presented by the Chairman, Judge
Gerald B. Tjofiat.

                   SENTENCING INSTITUTES

   The Conference in March 1980 (Conf. Rept., p. 29) ap­
proved the convening of a Joint Institute on Sentencing for
the judges of the Seventh and Ninth Circuits in November
1980, subject to the selection of a date and location which
were to be reported to the Conference at this session. Judge
Tjoflat informed the Conference that the tentative agenda for
this Sentencing Institute has been amended in light of the
experience gained from the Joint Institute on Sentencing
for the Third and Sixth Circuits, conducted in May 1980,
and that this next Sentencing Institute would be held Novem­
ber 17-19, 1980 at Oakland, California. Upon recommenda­
tion of the Committee the Conference approved the time,
place, participants, and agenda for the Joint Institute, as
submitted by the Committee.
                   VOLUNTARY SURRENDER

   In March 1974 (Conf. Rept., p. 31) the Conference en­
dorsed a procedure for the voluntary surrender of selected
sentenced offenders to Bureau of Prisons institutions and in
May 1980 the Director of the Administrative Office transmit­
ted to all judges and chief probation officers a letter from
the Deputy Attorney General urging increased use of voluntary
surrender procedures.
   Judge Tjoflat informed the Conference that between 50 and
55 percent of all persons now being committed to Federal
institutions are considered to be minimum security cases suit­
able in most instances for voluntary surrender. The Bureau of
Prisons has reported, however, that less than one-third of
these offenders are permitted to surrender voluntarily. The
Committee recommended that the Conference urge district
judges to make more use of voluntary surrender after con­
sidering the factors found by the Bureau of Prisons to be ap­
propriate criteria for security classification. This recommen­
dation was approved by the Conference.

                PRETRIAL SERVICES AGENCIES

  Judge Tjoflat informed the Conference that Congress had
approved the reprogramming of $900,000 in the Judiciary
                               86 



appropriations for the fiscal year 1980 to provide for the con­
tinuation of the 10 demonstration pretrial services agencies
through September 30, 1980. An amendment to continue
funding for these 10 demonstration agencies through the
fiscal year 1981 has been offered to the appropriations bill
which is still pending before the Senate.

                    PROBATION PERSONNEL

   The Conference was informed that the House Committee
on Appropriations had denied a request for 175 additional
deputy clerks for the fiscal year 1981 and had suggested that
"the needs of the respective clerks' offices can be met through a
reprogramming of resources and the transfer of positions
from probation offices to clerks' offices." The Director of
the Administrative Office, with the approval of the Budget
Committee, has asked the Senate Appropriations Committee
for authority to establish the 175 deputy clerk positions re­
quested and to offset the loss by abolishing 70 probation of­
ficer and 45 probation clerk positions through attrition over
the next two years. This will require the Probation Division
to continue an aggressive position in withdrawing authoriza­
tion and reallocating positions as they become vacant.


        COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION 

           OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM 


  Judge Robert E. DeMascio, Chairman of the Committee
on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System, presented
the Committee's report.

   SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR BANKRUPTCY JUDGES

  The Conference considered the Committee's report, to­
gether with the recommendations of the Director of the
Administrative Office and the recommendations of the cir­
cuit councils concerned, and took the following action relating
to bankruptcy judge positions and changes in salaries and
arrangements. The Conference further directed that these
actions become effective when appropriated funds are available.

            position at Bay City from $23,500 to $26,800 per annum.
            This increase is subject to the limitation on the m~imum
            salary of a combined part-time bankruptcy judge and
            part-time magistrate position adopted by resolution of
            the Conference in September 1974.

            position at Marquette from $20,000 to $22,000 per annum.

            and part-time magistrate position adopted by resolution
            of the Conference in September 1974.

           position at Okmulgee from $23,800 to $26,800 per
           annum.

          ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IN BANKRUPTCY COURTS
   Judge Demascio informed the Conference that the Com­
mittee had recommended and supported immediate action by
the Administrative Office in securing funds from the Con­
gress for 396 additional temporary clerical employees during
the fiscal year 1981 based upon the existing staffing formula.
The need for these positions is occasioned by the unprecedented
rise in bankruptcy case filings beginning in November 1979.
The Committee is projecting the filing of 374,000 new bank­
ruptcy estates in the year ending September 30, 1980.
   The Committee also approved a request for 396 additional
clerical positions in bankruptcy clerks' offices to be included
in the appropriation request for fiscal year 1982. The number
of positions may be modified by the recommendations to be
made by the work measurement experts now engaged in a
study of staffing requirements in the bankruptcy courts.

                      TRUSTEE COORDINATORS
  The Committee expressed its concern over the void left by
the Bankruptcy Reform Act in providing for the supervision
of the day-to-day activities of panel trustees in the 74 United
States bankruptcy courts in which trustee panels have been
established by the Director of the Administrative Office.
                                89 



Judge DeMascio reported that the Committee, in cooperation
with the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office,
had developed a list of duties to be performed by the bank­
ruptcy courts which would be helpful or essential to the ef­
ficient and scandal-free operation of the bankruptcy system.
The Committee believed that these duties could be performed
by a highly competent official with legal training who is on
the staff of the clerk of the bankruptcy court to be desig­
nated as the trustee coordinator.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference
approved the concept of the position of trustee coordinator in
districts in which trustees are qualified by the Director and
approved the description of the duties of the trustee coordinator
submitted by the Committee.

                  FUTURE JUDGESHIP SURVEYS

   Judge DeMascio informed the Conference that the statisti­
cal studies formerly used for surveys of judgeship positions in
bankruptcy courts are no longer reliable and cannot be used
as a basis for recommending additional positions between
now and 1984 when the Bankruptcy Reform Act becomes
fully effective. The Bankruptcy Division, however, is develop­
ing a new statistical base to project the number of bank­
ruptcy judges needed in 1984 through a reporting system
which will reflect changes in the responsibilities of bankruptcy
judges mandated by the Bankruptcy Reform Act. This new
reporting system includes for the first time data on trials con­
ducted by bankruptcy judges.
   Until sufficient data is accumulated under the new reporting
system it will not be possible for the Committee to make recom­
mendations for additional bankruptcy judge positions. Further­
more, any new positions recommended in 1981 could not be
funded until the fiscal year 1983, shortly before the final recom­
mendations for bankruptcy judgeship positions to be created
under the new Act are to be acted upon by the Conference. In
addition, any new bankruptcy judge positions authorized would
automatically terminate on March 31, 1984. District courts
would undoubtedly find it increasingly difficult to find qualified
persons to fill the positions as the April 1, 1984 date ap­
proaches.
                               90 



  Upon the recommendation of the Committee the Conference
instructed the Director of the Administrative Office to con­
duct no more studies of the need for increased bankruptcy
judge positions until the Bankruptcy Committee can deter­
mine that an adequate statistical base is available for
measuring the judicial workload of bankruptcy judges to be
appointed during the transition period and beginning on
April 1, 1984.


  COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
       FEDERAL MAGISTRATES SYSTEM

  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Federal Magistrates System was presented by the Chairman,
Senior Judge Charles M. Metzner.

       SPECIAL MAGISTRATES FOR INDIAN RESERVATIONS

   S. 2832, 96th Congress, would provide for Presidentially
appointed "special magistrates" to serve on Indian reserva­
tions. A special magistrate would have jurisdiction within the
boundaries of a designated Indian reservation to conduct
preliminary proceedings in criminal cases and to try misde­
meanors. In addition, the special magistrate could be autho­
rized by a district court to exercise the powers and duties of a
United States magistrate. The bill also contains provisions
concerning the law enforcement powers of tribal police,
representation of defendants and the selection of juries in
trials conducted by a special magistrate.
   It was the view of the Committee that the creation of a
separate parallel system of special magistrates having limited
jurisdiction concurrent with that of a United States magistrate
is unnecessary. The question of the appropriate level of law
enforcement on Indian reservations, however, is a policy
matter for congressional and executive determination.
   The Committee was further of the view that the provisions
in the bill creating separate procedures for selecting juries
in cases to be tried before special magistrates should also be
opposed. Maintenance of separate jury pools by a special
magistrate would be costly and duplicative of the work of the
                                91


district court jury commissioner. Restricting the composition
of juries to "persons who actually reside within the reserva­
tion on which the offense is alleged \to have been committed"
departs sharply from the philosophy ~f the Jury Selection and
Service Act of 1968 which establishes a right to a jury ran­
domly selected "from a fair cross section of the community."
Requiring a special magistrate to compile an independent
list of persons "eligible or registered" to vote in state, local,
or tribal elections is inconsistent with 28 U.S.C. 1863 which
prescribes the use of local voter registration lists or lists of
actual voters. Furthermore, limiting the size of a jury to six
persons is an unprecedented departure from the traditional
practice of having twelve jurors for the trial of a criminal case.
   On recommendation of the Committee the Conference
authorized the transmission of these views to the Congress.

                  LEGAL ASSISTANT POSITIONS

   The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979 authorized the Con­
ference to provide legal assistant positions for full-time United
States magistrates. In March 1980 (Conf. Rept., p. 32), the
Conference adopted standards for legal assistant positions for
magistrates. Judge Metzner informed the Conference that the
Committee had received requests for 84 legal assistant posi­
tions from the district courts, all of which have been approved
by the judicial councils of their respective circuits, and had
received another 30 requests from courts which are awaiting
circuit council approval. In addition, further requests are
anticipated. The Conference, on recommendation of the
Committee, voted to include in the 1982 budget the funds
necessary to establish 125 legal assistant positions for the 204
full-time magistrates. The Committee was further authorized
to consider the appropriate allocation of these positions in
accordance with the standards previously approved by the
Conference.

              CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

  After consideration of the report of the Committee and
the recommendations of the Director of the Administrative
Office, the district courts and the judicial councils of the
                                    92 



circuits, the Conference approved the following changes in
salaries and arrangements for full-time and part-time magis­
trate positions. Unless otherwise indicated, these changes are
to become effective when appropriate funds are available.
The salaries of full-time magistrate positions are to be deter­
mined in accordance with the salary plan previously adopted
by the Conference.

              COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE 

                 CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 


  Senior Judge Thomas J. MacBride, Chairman of the Com­
mittee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act, presented the
Committee's report.

                    ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   The Conference authorized the Director of the Administra­
tive Office to distribute copies of a report on appointments
                               98 



and payments under the Criminal Justice Act for the first
half of the fiscal year 1980, October 1, 1979 to March 31,
1980, to all chief judges, all Federal defender organizations
and others who may request copies. The report stated that
$26,000,000 was appropriated for the defense services during
the fiscal year 1980 and that the projected obligations during
the year are $24,750,000. During the period covered by the
report approximately 20,671 persons were represented under
the Criminal Justice Act as compared to 19,084 during a
similar period of the fiscal year 1979, and 20,238 during the
first half of the fiscal year 1978. The Committee anticipates
that the total number of appointments during the fiscal year
1980 will be 42,000, a decrease of 1.2 percent from the
42,519 appointments currently reported for the fiscal year 1979.
   Federal public defender organizations represented 6,784
persons during the reporting period, and community defender
organizations represented 3,300 persons. Collectively these
defender organizations accounted for 48.8 percent of the total
representations under the Criminal Justice Act during the
first half of the fiscal year 1980.
   The report anticipates that the average cost of representa­
tion by Federal public defenders under the Criminal Justice
Act during the fiscal year 1980 will be $704 per case; $499
per case for representation by private panel attorneys; and
$501 per case for representation by community defender
organizations. The average cost per case for community
defender organizations is unusually low due to the inclusion
of a large number of petty offense and immigration law
representations from the Southern District of California. If
these representations are eliminated, the estimated cost per
case for representation by community defender organizations
would be $675.

      BUDGET REQUESTS-FEDERAL PuBLIC DEFENDERS

  The Criminal Justice Act as amended, requires each
Federal public defender organization, established pursuant to
18 U.S.C. 3006A(h)(2)(A), to submit a proposed budget to be
approved by the Judicial Conference in accordance with 28
U.S.C. 605. The Conference approved the following sup­
plemental and annual budgetary requests for these offices:

           COMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS­
                  CONDITIONS OF GRANT

  Judge MacBride informed the Conference that it was
necessary to amend Clause S of the Conditions of Grant to a
Community Defender Organization to require that a certified
annual audit be submitted to the Administrative Office
along with the return of unexpended grant funds and other
funds remaining at the end of the fiscal year and to amend
Clause 8 of the Conditions of Grant to require the submission
of the audit within 7S days of the end of each fiscal year. The
Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, there­
upon amended Clauses Sand 8 to read as follows:
      5. UNOBLIGATED OR UNEXPENDED BALANCE: The
    Grantee shall return unobligated or unexpended grant funds,
    grant interest, and grant-related income remaining at the end
    of the fiscal year to the Administrative Office, together with a
    copy of the certified annual audit, within 75 days of the end
    of the fiscal year for which the grant was awarded, unless
    otherwise authorized by the A.O. The Grantee shall include a
    statement identifying which portion of the funds returned
    represents grant funds, grant interest, and grant-related income.
                                   101


       8. AUDITS: The Grantee shall submit, within 75 days of
    the end of each fiscal year, a certified audit of the statement
    of financial position to be included in the annual report of
    Grantee operations for the fiscal year for which the grant was
    awarded. The audit must be performed in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles and auditing stan­
    dards by a Certified Public Accountant of the Grantee's
    choosing. The audit should be a systematic review to deter­
    mine whether financial operations have been properly con­
    ducted. The audit must set forth expenditures in accordance
    with the designated object classifications contained in the ap­
    proved grant, and must verify that grant funds, and grant­
    related income, were in fact properly expended in accordance
    with those object classifications. Unless waived by the A.O.,
    Grantee audits must be performed according to the federal
    fiscal year.
  The Conference also approved an amendment to Clause 14
of the Conditions of Grant to require advance approval of
the Administrative Office for case-related travel outside the
continental United States and administrative travel out of the
district. The amendment parallels the existing policy with
respect to travel by persons in Federal Public
Defender Organizations. The amended condition is as follows:
       14. TRAVEL, MEALS AND LODGING: The Grantee's
    reimbursement policy regarding expenses for travel, meals, and
    lodging should ordinarily not exceed the maximum allowances to
    be paid for per diem, actual expenses, and travel prescribed for
    federal employees. Authorization for case-related travel outside
    the continental United States and administrative travel out of the
    district in which defense services are provided should be re­
    quested in advance, in writing, from the Chief of the Criminal
    Justice Act Division of the Administrative Office. In an emer­
    gency, telephonic requests will be accepted, but must later be
    confirmed in writing.

   The Conference further amended clause 6 of the Condi­
tions of Grant to require that the annual report of each
Community Defender Organization include a list of changes
in the list of officers and directors of the organization and a
list of changes in the roster of attorneys and other personnel
employed by or associated with the organization. The amended
condition reads as follows:
                                   102


       6. ANNUAL REPORTS: As required by subsection (h)(2)
    (B) of the CJA, the Grantee must submit an annual report
    setting forth its activities, financial position, the anticipated
    caseload and expenses for the coming fiscal year, and any
    revisions to the list of officers and directors of the organiza­
    tion, including changes of addresses, and any additions or
    deletions to the roster of attorneys and other personnel em­
    ployed by or associated with the Grantee, including addresses
    and data as to bar membership, qualifications and experience.
    Instructions for completing the annual report and its date of
    submission will be provided to the Grantee by the Adminis­
    trative Office at least thirty (30) days prior to the submission
    date.

     AMENDMENTS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT GUIDELINES

  The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee,
approved the following amendments to the guidelines for the
administration of the Criminal Justice Act:
       1. An addition to paragraph 2.01 to clarify the obligation
    of appointed counsel to disclose clients' financial assets.
      2. An addition to paragraph 2.01 to provide guidance and
    policy clarification with regard to the composition and manage­
    ment of Criminal Justice Act panels of private attorneys.

                    ATTORNEY COMPENSATION

   The Committee pointed out that the existing rates and
maximum limits of compensation payable to attorneys ap­
pointed under the Criminal Justice Act had not been in­
creased since 1970. In the last ten years the cumulative ef­
fects of inflation have given rise to two problems: (1) diffi­
culties in obtaining attorneys willing to accept appointments;
and (2) increased burdens placed upon the chief judges of the
circuits resulting from constantly increasing claims for excess
compensation. Convinced that the existing rates and limits of
compensation are inadequate, the Committee recommended,
and the Conference approved, the following resolution:
        The Judicial Conference agrees with the views of its Com­
     mittee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act, and shares the
     concern of that Committee over the inadequacy of the existing
     rates of compensation and maximum limits under the Crimi­
     nal Justice Act, and the adverse impact these inadequacies
                                103


    are having, and will continue to have, on the implementation
    and operation of the Criminal Justice Act.
      The Judicial Conference recommends that the Congress
    address these issues as soon as possible to insure that the
    purposes of the Criminal Justice Act are fully achieved.
      The Director of the Administrative Office of the United
    States Courts is authorized to transmit to the appropriate
    congressional committees the views of the Conference, as
    expressed in this Resolution.

            DEFENDER MALPRACTICE LEGISLATION

   In April 1980, S. 2617 was introduced by Senator DeConcini
in the 96th Congress to amend the Criminal Justice Act to
provide protection for the officers and employees of Federal
Defender Organizations against personal liability for mal­
practice. The bill would not grant a public defender im­
munity from suit, nor would it take away the rights of
plaintiffs claiming malpractice, but would insulate defenders
from personal liability by authorizing the Director of the
Administrative Office to be a self-insurer or to obtain liability
insurance. Judge MacBride reported that Senator DeConcini's
request for Conference views had previously been acted upon
by the Executive Committee of the Conference and that the
Executive Committee had endorsed the legislation on behalf
of the Conference.


       COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION 

            OF THE CRIMINAL LAW 


  Judge Alexander Harvey II, Chairman of the Committee
on the Administration of the Criminal Law, presented the
Committee's report.

                     WIRETAP LEGISLATION

  H.R. 6710. 96th Congress, would repeal Chapter 119, of
Title 18 U.S. Code, relating to the interception of wire and
oral communications and would substitute a new Title 7 to
the Communications Act of 1934 dealing with the inter­
ception of protected communications by common carriers
                             104 



and other persons. Several important changes would be
made. A court order authorizing an interception would have
to be obtained even though one party to the communication
had consented to the intercept. Under existing law an inter­
ception order may be issued during an investigation to deter­
mine if a crime has been committed, but under H.R. 6710
the crime must have already been committed at the time the
order was issued. A prior court order would be necessary
before an interception could be made by means of a pen
register. Only Federal courts could issue interception orders.
Finally, persons unlawfully intercepting communications
could be prosecuted on the basis of a "knowing" interception
rather than a "willful" interception.
   The Committee recommended that the Conference take no
position on the policy implications of this legislation but
recommended disapproval of some of the provisions of the
bill which the committee believed would have an adverse im­
pact on the administration of the criminal law in the Federal
courts. The Committee was strongly opposed to the provision
of the bill which would require the issuance of wiretap orders
only by Federal courts, because of the potential impact on
workload and the inconvenience to state officials who may
reside at great distances from Federal courts. The Committee
recommended that state court judges be authorized to issue
wiretap orders. The Committee did express approval of the
provision in H.R. 6710 which would establish a "knowing"
rather than a "willful" standard for the prosecution of a
person who violates a wiretapping law. These views of the
Committee were endorsed by the Conference. The Conference
also expressed disapproval of the provision which would re­
quire a court order if one party to the communication con­
sents, a position consistent with the Rules of Evidence.
   Judge Harvey also informed the Conference that the Com­
mittee had considered S. 1717, 96th Congress, which would
make several clarifYing amendments to Title 3 of the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 relating to the
interception of communications.
            PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES OF JUDGES
  H.R. 7473, 96th Congress would amend the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure to require the transfer of a criminal
                              lOS


case to another judge on motion of a defendant and without
a showing of cause. A similar bill, H.R. 7165, 96th Congress
would authorize such a challenge in both civil and criminal
cases. The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules had
previously addressed H.R. 7473, opposed the legislation, and
requested that the Congress await a study being made by the
Federal Judicial Center before considering the bill.
   Along with both circuit conferences and judges' associa­
tions, the Committee unanimously requested the Conference
to oppose such legislation strongly. Particularly in criminal
cases, such legislation would be extremely disruptive of
calendaring, perhaps causing a return to the master calendar
system, would delay bringing a trial a very large number of
criminal cases, and would cause problems under the Speedy
Trial Act. Permitting peremptory recusal of a judge would
encourage judge-shopping, would also have the effect of in­
hibiting judicial independence, and would encourage judges
to be passive and refrain from rendering unpopular decisions,
even though the judge in his individual conscience might feel
that such a decision was the correct one.
   The Conference approved the Committee's recommendation,
expressing its strong disapproval of any legislation which
would permit the peremptory disqualification of judicial of­
ficers. The Conference also noted that present provisions
dealing with disqualification for cause are themselves not ef­
fective or strong enough and should be improved.
               THREATS TO JUDICIAL EMPLOYEES
   Existing law prohibits threats to certain designated federal
officers, including judges, but there is no federal statute which
permits prosecution of those making threats of bodily! harm
to members of judges' staffs or to other court personnel.
With the increase of such threats in recent years, the Con­
ference authorized the drafting of such legislation and directed
that the proposed legislation be transmitted to each of the
Conference members for comment.
            COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION
                 OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  Chief Judge C. Clyde Atkins, Chairman of the Committee
on the Operation of the Jury System, presented the Commit­
tee's report.
                              106


             FREE PRESS-FAIR TRIAL GUIDELINES
   In 1976 the Conference authorized the Committee to
undertake a study of the existing Conference guidelines for
district courts on the management of highly publicized cases
which raise an apparent conflict between freedom of the press
and the right to a fair trial. Judge Atkins submitted to the
Conference a report entitled "Free Press-Fair Trial, Pro­
posed Revised Guidelines of the Judicial Conference of the
United States-1980," which was initially prepared by a sub­
committee under the chairmanship of Chief Judge Collins J.
Seitz of the Third Circuit. Judge Atkins stated that the new
guidelines had been submitted for comment to a wide cross­
section of the Federal judiciary, the legal profession, and the
news media. Almost 60 individuals and organizations were
provided with preliminary copies of the draft report and were
invited to comment upon it. The responses, all of which were
seriously considered by the subcommittee, reflected sub­
stantial agreement with its recommendations.
   The report recommends that the standard of "reasonable
likelihood" of interference with a fair trial should be retained
as the test for regulation of attorney comment in Federal
criminal cases. In deference to judicial decisions, however,
the report recommends that the guidelines restricting at­
torney comment should no longer be applied to civil actions,
to criminal cases which are not to be tried by a jury, or to
that phase of criminal proceedings following the return of a
guilty verdict where all that remains to be done by the court
is the imposition of sentence. New sections were added to
recommendation C in order to recognize in a formal way (1)
that no court order or rule should attempt to restrain represen­
tatives of the news media from publishing any information
already in their possession regarding a pending criminal case,
and (2) that all criminal proceedings should be held in open
court, except that discretion is reserved to the courts to close
certain pretrial hearings to the public where the tests set by
the Supreme Court in Gannett Co. v. DePasquale. 443 U.S.
368 (1979), have been met. The report contains other minor
proposals for adjustments in the guidelines, as enumerated in
the Committee comment thereto.
   On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
proved the revised report and authorized its dissemination to
                                  107 



all United States district judges and to the public as a policy
statement of measures to control prejudicial publicity af­
fecting the right to a fair trial.

            EXCUSE AND DISQUALIFICATION OF JURORS

   Judge Atkins informed the Conference that the Committee
had undertaken a study of the policies of the district courts
in excusing prospective jurors from jury service in light of
the decision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Goodlow,
597 F.2d 159 (1979) and in the light of a separate inquiry by
the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice as to the
policies of the Federal courts in permitting handicapped
persons, including the blind and the deaf, to serve on juries.
It was the view of the Committee that the district courts
should be asked to review the excuse provisions of their jury
selection plans at reasonable intervals in order to consolidate
and minimize the categories of persons who are eligible for
permanent excuse from jury service under 28 U.S.c. 1863
(b)(5), and further that the district courts should seriously
consider dispensing with all existing excuse categories except
such of the following, as in their discretion, they may see fit
to retain:
    1. 	   Persons over 70 years of age.
    2. 	   Persons who have, within the past two years, served on a
           Federal grand or petit jury panel. See 28 U.S.c. §1866(e).
    3. 	   Persons having active care and custody of a child or
           children under 10 years of age whose health and/or
           safety would be jeopardized by their absence for jury
           service; or a person who is essential to the care of aged
           or infirmed persons.
    4. 	   Any person whose services are so essential to the opera­
           tion of a business, commercial, or agricultural enter­
           prise that said enterprise must close if such person
           were required to perform jury duty.
    s. 	   Persons in professional categories and occupations, such
           as doctors and lawyers.
   The report further recommends a shortening of jury terms
and increased attention to individual requests for excuse
from jury service because of hardship.
   Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference approved the report on the. excuse and disqualifica­
                               108 



tion of jurors submitted by the Committee and authorized its
distribution to all United States district judges.

                  SERVICE OF JURY SUMMONS

   The Jury Selection and Service Act now requires that a
summons addressed to a person selected for Federal jury
service shall be served upon the prospective juror personally
or by registered or certified mail, 28 U.S.C. §1866(b). In
practice, the summons is ordinarily served by mail and not
personally. Judge Atkins stated that the Committee had con­
sidered a proposal to permit the service of a jury summons by
ordinary first class mail, in addition to the methods cur­
rently authorized. It had been pointed out to the Committee
that serving jury summons by regular mail would reduce the
burden on clerks' offices, reduce mailing costs, and perhaps
promote a more ready response by recipients, some of whom
may hesitate to take delivery of a registered or certified letter.
   The Committee submitted a draft bill to permit service of a
jury summons by regular mail, pointing out, however, that it
is not urging all district courts to adopt this practice. Courts
facing a substantial problem in achieving juror compliance
with summonses may wish to continue service by registered or
certified mail and should retain discretion to do so. Never­
theless, the Committee believed that courts should be per­
mitted to select the particular manner of service which is
found to be most appropriate in view of local circumstances.
The Conference approved the draft bill and authorized its
submission to the Congress.

            SECRECY OF GRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS

  Judge Atkins informed the Conference that a subcommittee
had been appointed to review the recent draft report sub­
mitted by the General Accounting Office regarding the
security of Federal grand jury proceedings. The subcommittee
will develop an appropriate response to the recommendations
of the report and will consider any other reforms in Federal
grand jury operations which might be useful in meeting some
of the objections contained in the report. The Subcommittee
will also cooperate with the Advisory Committee on the
                              109



Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in the consideration of
those portions of the report concerned with suggestions for
changes in the criminal rules.
   REPORT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE 

             ON ADMISSION OF ATTORNEYS 

                  TO FEDERAL PRACTICE 

   Judge James Lawrence King, Chairman of the Implemen­
tation Committee on the Admission of Attorneys to Federal
Practice, presented a report on the activities of the Committee.
   The report indicated that 14 United States district courts,
geographically representative of the Federal judiciary and
having a variety of arrangements in terms of judicial man­
power, caseload, and the arrangement of statutory divisions
and places of holding court, have agreed to participate in a
pilot program. The Committee has been attempting to devise
methods to assist the courts in the orderly implementation
and conduct of attorney admission programs, has arranged a
seminar for the chief judges and other representative judges
of the pilot courts, and has participated in the compilation
and publication of an implementation manual to be distributed
to the judges supervising the pilot program in each partici­
pating court. The Committee is also continuing to study the
appropriate methods for the evaluation of the pilot program
in accordance with the direction of the Conference.
          PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE 

                   COURTS OF APPEALS 

  The Conference, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, approved the
pretermission of terms of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Wichita, Kansas
during the calendar year 1981.

          RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of matters
considered at this session where necessary for legislative or
