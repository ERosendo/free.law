          AD HOC STRATEGIC PLANNING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL
      CENTER

             In 1996, the Chief Justice appointed an Ad Hoc Strategic Planning Committee of the Federal
      Judicial Center to review and to make recommendations concerning the operations of the Federal Judicial
      Center (FJC) in relation to its statutory missions. The report and recommendations of the Ad Hoc
      Committee were approved by the FJC Board in June 1997. Several of the recommendations of the Ad Hoc
      Committee's report expressly involve the relationship between the Administrative Office and the Federal
      Judicial Center, including recommendations 4 and 7, which concern, respectively, education and training
      in the third branch and the creation of a high-level interagency working group to resolve potential
      interagency conflicts. The Director of the FJC submitted to the Executive Committee two motions
      (identified as Motions A and B) to implement these two recommendations. On recommendation of the
      Executive Committee, the Judicial Conference authorized the creation of an ad hoc committee, consisting
      of members of the Conference to be selected and appointed by the Chief Justice, to study the merits of
      Motions A and B related to the Report of the Ad Hoc Strategic Planning Committee of the Federal
      Judicial Center. The ad hoc committee is to make a report and recommendation for consideration by the
      March 1998 Judicial Conference.

            The Director of the Federal Judicial Center also proposed a motion relating to improved
     communication between the Director and the Executive Committee concerning matters involving the FJC.
     In response, the Executive Committee adopted the following:

                 The Executive Committee agrees to consider improved means by which the Director of
           the Federal Judicial Center may confer directly with the Committee on matters involving the
           Center's missions of research and education or the Center itself. The Committee is likewise
           receptive to receiving information about the Center's research activities.

     RESOLUTIONS

           The Judicial Conference approved a recommendation of the Executive Committee to adopt the
     following resolution in recognition of the substantial contributions made by Judicial Conference
     committee chairs who will complete their terms of service in 1997:

                The Judicial Conference of the United States recognizes with appreciation, respect and
           admiration the following judicial officers:

                                    HONORABLE J. OWEN FORRESTER
                                    Committee on Automation and Technology

                                    HONORABLE ANN C. WILLIAMS
                            Committee on Court Administration and Case Management

                                    HONORABLE BAREFOOT SANDERS
                                      Committee on the Judicial Branch

                                     HONORABLE JAMES K. LOGAN
                         Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure

                                   HONORABLE D. LOWELL JENSEN
                         Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

            Appointed as committee chairs by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, these outstanding jurists
     have played a vital role in the administration of the federal court system. These judges served with
     distinction as leaders of their Judicial Conference committees while, at the same time, continuing to
     perform their duties as judges in their own courts. They have set a standard of skilled leadership and
     earned our deep respect and sincere gratitude for their innumerable contributions. We acknowledge with
     appreciation their commitment and dedicated service to the Judicial Conference and to the entire federal
     judiciary.

     FINANCIAL MATTERS

            The Committee approved interim fiscal year 1998 financial plans for the Salaries and Expenses,
     Defender Services, Fees of Jurors and Commissioners, and Court Security accounts. The Committee
     authorized the Director of the Administrative Office to make technical and other adjustments to these
     plans, as deemed appropriate. In addition, for any year in which the judiciary does not receive new
     appropriations, the Committee authorized the continuation of judicial branch operations from all available
     sources of fees and no-year appropriations, subject to any necessary approval of congressional
     reprogramming requests, until such time as those funds are exhausted and under such guidance and
     direction as the Director of the Administrative Office deems appropriate.

     JUDICIAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MATTERS

           Every five years each committee of the Judicial Conference must recommend to the Executive
     Committee, with a justification, whether it should be maintained or abolished (JCUS-SEP 87, p. 60).
     Pursuant to this mandate, each committee submitted to the Executive Committee a completed self-
     evaluation questionnaire, which was considered by the Executive Committee at its August 1997 meeting.
     The Executive Committee made no changes to the committee structure itself, but, on request of the
     respective committees, revised the jurisdictional statements of the Committees on Automation and
     Technology, Budget, Court Administration and Case Management, Defender Services, Federal-State
     Jurisdiction, and Judicial Resources. The Executive Committee declined to approve a requested
     modification to the jurisdictional statement of the Intercircuit Assignments Committee.

           On recommendation of the Committee on Security, Space and Facilities, the Executive Committee
     changed the name of that committee to the Committee on Security and Facilities, effective October 1,
     1997.

     _____________________
     MISCELLANEOUS ACTIONS

            The Executive Committee:

        ๏ฎ   Agreed, on recommendation of the Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges
            System, to continue the part-time magistrate judge position at San Bernardino, California for
            an additional 180 days or until a successor is approved to fill the part-time magistrate judge
            position at Barstow, California, whichever occurs first.

        ๏ฎ   Approved a recommendation of the Committee on the Budget that the Conference seek an
            amendment to title 28 permitting the Director of the Administrative Office to designate
            disbursing and certifying officers in the third branch.

        ๏ฎ   Authorized a 60-day suspension of the $.50 per page miscellaneous copying fee in the district
            and bankruptcy courts of North Dakota to enable attorneys impacted by flood conditions in
            the district to reconstruct their files in pending cases (see also infra, "Waivers in Natural
            Disaster Emergencies," pp. 60-61).

        ๏ฎ   Approved a recommendation of the Committee on the Judicial Branch that the Judicial
            Conference take no position on section (2)(a) of H.R. 930 (105th Congress), which would
            authorize the Administrator of General Services to issue regulations that would require the use
            of the government-issued travel charge card for all payments of expenses of official
            government travel, because it appears not to apply to the judiciary. In the event the proposed
            legislation is amended or clarified to cover the judiciary, then the Judicial Conference will
            oppose it.

        ๏ฎ   Agreed to amend the fiscal year 1997 financial plan for the Defender Services appropriation
            to revise the distribution of allocations between activities within the plan and to increase the
            total by up to $5,197,000, and to notify Congress of the change.

        ๏ฎ   On recommendation of the Committee on Security, Space and Facilities, approved the release
            of space in the Federal Building in Leavenworth, Kansas.

        ๏ฎ   Tentatively concurred in procedures outlined by the Committee on International Judicial
            Relations for receipt of funds and for international travel by judiciary representatives, subject
            to further review by the Executive Committee at a later date.


RPJC Sep 1997                                                                                          Page 5 of 26
        ๏ฎ   Established a mechanism whereby each Judicial Conference committee shall periodically
            review the text of a judicial improvements bill in the form in which it was last introduced in
            Congress with regard to items within its jurisdiction, and make specific recommendations to
            the Executive Committee regarding deletions for the next bill. These recommendations will be
            presented for Judicial Conference action, where appropriate, by the Executive Committee.

        ๏ฎ   Authorized the long-range planning liaisons from relevant Conference committees to meet
            annually, if activities warrant.

        ๏ฎ   Agreed to distribute to the Conference committee chairs for comment a document outlining
            Conference and committee procedures entitled The Judicial Conference of the United States
            and its Committees and to present the document to the March 1998 Judicial Conference for its
            approval. If approved, the document will be distributed periodically to all judicial officers.

        ๏ฎ   Approved a request of the Chair of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure that the
            Rules Committee and its advisory committees be exempt from the practice of appointing
            circuit liaisons within the committees.

        ๏ฎ   Affirmed that the Director of the Administrative Office and his staff (in consultation with the
            Chair of the Executive Committee) are the designated points of contact for all legislative
            communications from the judiciary.

        ๏ฎ   Provided comments to Congress for alternatives more appropriate than the Administrative
            Office for funding the local courts of the District of Columbia.

     COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
        ______________________
        COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that it is continuing to monitor developments
     related to pursuing the legislative goal of relieving the Administrative Office of its responsibility for
     supporting the District of Columbia Public Defender Service. In addition, the Committee was briefed by
     the Director of the Administrative Office on the status of legislative activity of interest to the judiciary and
     on agency activities. After reviewing the results of a study on the Administrative Office's advisory
     processes, the Committee endorsed a general approach for restructuring the process. The Committee also
     discussed a report of the Ad Hoc Strategic Planning Committee of the Federal Judicial Center and noted
     that some aspects of the report would have an impact on the Administrative Office. The Committee
     endorsed the following statement:

            Recognizing that the director of the Administrative Office has the authority to delegate, contract for
            services, and enter into interagency agreements in exercising his responsibilities, the director is
            nonetheless under legal obligations, which include his statutory duties and those assigned to him by
            the Judicial Conference. The director should take no action nor enter into any agreement that would
            prevent or restrict his ability to carry out those duties.

         INTERNET ACCESS AND USE

                  The Internet is a global network of networks, enabling computers of all kinds to communicate
            and share information throughout much of the world. Demand for access by judges and court staff

          for information-gathering, research and electronic mail outside the judiciary's Data Communications
          Network (DCN) is increasing. However, there are security risks associated with use of the Internet.
          To balance security concerns with the ability of local courts to provide Internet access, the Judicial
          Conference approved a policy, recommended by the Committee on Automation and Technology,
          that for any computer connected to the DCN, access to the Internet be provided only through
          national gateway connections approved by the Administrative Office pursuant to procedures
          adopted by the Committee on Automation and Technology.

                Experience outside the judiciary has shown that there are four principal areas of concern
          associated with uncontrolled access to the Internet: institutional embarrassment, misperception of
          authority, lost productivity, and capacity demand. On recommendation of the Committee, the
          Conference agreed to urge all courts to adopt their own policies establishing local responsibility for
          managing employee access to the Internet and providing guidance on the responsible use of the
          Internet.

          ____________________
          STANDARD ELECTRONIC CITATIONS

                 On August 6, 1996, the American Bar Association (ABA) approved a resolution calling for
          state and federal courts to develop a standard, format-neutral citation system and recommending a
          format that could be used. After surveying federal judges and providing an opportunity for public
          comment, including a public hearing, the Committee on Automation and Technology recommended
          that the Judicial Conference decline to adopt the ABA's recommendation on citation issues at this
          time. The Judicial Conference approved the Committee's recommendation. The Committee will
          explore studying the desirability, feasibility, and cost of establishing a centrally maintained, publicly
          accessible electronic database of all opinions submitted by federal courts for inclusion in the
          database.

     OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM
         __________________
         BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIPS

                The Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System evaluated the need for 10
          temporary bankruptcy judgeship positions that had been authorized pursuant to the Bankruptcy
          Judgeship Act of 1992 and were due to expire with the first vacancies occurring as early as 1998.
          Based on recent judicial workload statistics and other factors, the Committee recommended, and the
          Judicial Conference agreed to take, the following actions:

          a. Transmit to Congress proposed legislation to make permanent the temporary judgeships in the
          District of Puerto Rico and the Northern District of Alabama;

          b. Transmit to Congress proposed legislation to extend the temporary judgeships for additional five-
          year periods in the District of South Carolina, the Western District of Texas, the Eastern District of
          Tennessee, and the Southern District of Illinois;

          c. Reiterate its recommendation to Congress that the temporary position in the District of Delaware
          be extended to the first vacancy occurring due to death, retirement, resignation, or removal in the
          district that occurs 10 years or more after the date on which the temporary judgeship was originally
          filled; and

          d. Take no action with regard to the status of the temporary judgeships in the District of New
          Hampshire, the Middle District of North Carolina, and the District of Colorado, which will permit

        FISCAL YEAR 1999 BUDGET REQUEST

                In recognition of congressional funding constraints, the Budget Committee reduced and
          adjusted the program committees' proposed funding levels for the fiscal year 1999 budget request.
          The Judicial Conference approved the Budget Committee's lower budget request for fiscal year
          1999, subject to amendments necessary as a result of new legislation, actions of the Judicial
          Conference, or other reasons the Director of the Administrative Office considers necessary and
          appropriate.

          ___________________
          TEMPORARY EMERGENCY FUND

                 The temporary emergency fund (TEF) is used for the employment of short-term temporary
          secretaries and law clerks to assist judicial officers in emergency situations. Since fiscal year 1996,
          funds may be reprogrammed between the TEF and tenant alterations (JCUS-SEP 95, p. 73). The
          circuit judicial councils oversee the spending of TEF funds, but control over the actual funds has
          remained at the Administrative Office. On recommendation of the Budget Committee, the Judicial
          Conference approved implementation of the decentralization of the temporary emergency fund so
          that the actual allotment of the TEF funds will be made to the circuit councils.

          _____________________
          MISCELLANEOUS FEE SCHEDULES
                 Bankruptcy Court. The Judicial Conference is authorized by 28 U.S.C. ยง 1930(b) to
          prescribe miscellaneous bankruptcy fees. With significant input from the Bankruptcy Committee,
          which recently undertook a review of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule, the Court
          Administration and Case Management Committee recommended a number of revisions to the fee
          schedule. The Judicial Conference approved these revisions, which would:
          (a) raise the fee for exemplification of a document because of the additional time and resources
          required (Item 2); (b) eliminate as burdensome to the clerk's office the requirement that creditors be
          notified when an amendment is made to a debtor's schedules of creditors or lists of creditors (Item
          4); (c) expand the $30 administrative fee to apply to all chapters under title 11 and eliminate the
          $.50 per notice fee (Item 8); (d) eliminate the fee for filing a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy
          court in proceedings arising under the Bankruptcy Act (i.e., pre-1979) (Item 9); (e) eliminate as
          burdensome to the clerk's office the $.25 fee for processing each claim filed in excess of 10 (Item


RPJC Sep 1997                                                                                        Page 8 of 26
          10); (f) eliminate the fee for "transcribing a record of any proceeding by a regularly employed
          member of the bankruptcy court staff" because it is rarely utilized (Item 11); (g) increase to $35, to
          account for inflation, the fee for the "retrieval of a record from a Federal Records Center, National
          Archives, or other storage location removed from the place of business of the court," provided
          legislation is enacted permitting the judiciary to retain the increase (Item 13); (h) establish that the
          fee for docketing a notice of appeal or cross appeal from a bankruptcy judge's decision will be equal
          to the fee for filing an appeal from a district court to a court of appeals (Items 16 and 22); (i)
          increase the fee for filing a petition ancillary to a foreign proceeding to an amount equal to the fee
          for commencing a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, contingent upon the enactment of legislation
          permitting the judiciary to retain the resulting increase (Item 17); (j) establish that the fee for "filing
          a motion to terminate, annul, modify, or condition the automatic stay provided under 11 U.S.C. ยง
          362(a), a motion to compel abandonment of property of the estate pursuant to Rule 6007(b) of the
          Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, or a motion to withdraw the reference of a case or
          proceeding under 28 U.S.C. 157(d)" will be equal to one-half the fee for instituting a civil action
          under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1914(a) (Item 21); and (k) add a new fee for the reopening of bankruptcy cases
          payable upon the filing of the motion to reopen.

                 The amended Miscellaneous Fee Schedule for the Bankruptcy Courts reads in pertinent part
          as follows:

                Item 2: For certification of any document or paper, whether the certification is made directly
                on the document or by separate instrument, $5. For exemplification of any document or paper,
                twice the amount of the fee for certification.

                Item 4: For amendments to a debtor's schedules of creditors or lists of creditors, $20 for each
                amendment, provided the bankruptcy judge may, for good cause, waive the charge in any
                case.

                 Item 8: In all cases filed under title 11, the clerk shall collect from the debtor or the
                petitioner a miscellaneous administrative fee of $30. This fee may be paid in installments in
                the same manner that the filing fee may be paid in installments, consistent with the procedure
                set forth in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 1006.

                Item 9: For filing a motion to reopen a Bankruptcy Code case, a fee shall be collected in the
                same amount as the filing fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. ยง 1930(a) for commencing a new case
                on the date of reopening, unless the reopening is to correct an administrative error or for
                actions related to the debtor's discharge. The court may waive this fee under appropriate
                circumstances or may defer payment of the fee from trustees pending discovery of additional
                assets.

                Item 16: For docketing a proceeding on appeal or review from a final judgment of a
                bankruptcy judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 158(a) and (b), the fee shall be the same amount as
                the fee for docketing a case on appeal or review to the appellate court as required by Item 1 of
                the Court of Appeals Miscellaneous Fee Schedule. A separate fee shall be paid by each party
                filing a notice of appeal in the bankruptcy court, but parties filing a joint notice of appeal in
                the bankruptcy court are required to pay only one fee.

                Item 17 (Provided the judiciary is authorized to retain the increase): For filing a petition
                ancillary to a foreign proceeding under 11 U.S.C. ยง 304, a fee shall be collected in the same
                amount as the filing fee prescribed in 28 U.S.C. ยง 1930(a)(3) for a case commenced under
                chapter 11 of title 11.

                 Item 21: For filing a motion to terminate, annul, modify, or condition the automatic stay
                provided under ยง 362 of title 11, a motion to compel abandonment of property of the estate
                pursuant to Rule 6007(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, or a motion to
                withdraw the reference of a case or proceeding under 28 U.S.C. ยง 157(d), a fee shall be
                collected in the amount of one-half the filing fee prescribed in 28 U.S.C. ยง 1914(a) for
                instituting any civil action other than a writ of habeas corpus. If a child support creditor or its
                representative is the movant, and if such movant files the form required by ยง 304(g) of the
                Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, no fee is required.

                Item 22: For docketing a cross appeal from a bankruptcy court determination, the fee shall be
                the same amount as the fee for docketing a case on appeal or review to the appellate court as
                required by Item 1 of the Court of Appeals Miscellaneous Fee Schedule.

                 District Court. Item 11 of the District Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule, prescribed by the
          Judicial Conference under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1914(b), sets out a $50 fee "for admission of attorneys to
          practice." Many district courts also charge local attorney admission fees in addition to the fee set out
          in the Miscellaneous Fee Schedule. There has been some confusion as to whether the District Court
          Miscellaneous Fee Schedule either permits or requires the collection of a fee for pro hac vice
          admission or for a renewal of an attorney's admission to practice. On recommendation of the
          Committee on Court Administration and Case Management, the Judicial Conference amended item
          11 of the Miscellaneous Fee Schedule to clarify that the attorney admission fee applies only to
          original admissions, as follows:

                For original admission of attorneys to practice, $50 each, including a certificate of admission.
                For a duplicate certificate of admission or certificate of good standing, $15.

          In addition, the Conference agreed to direct the Administrative Office to inform the courts that: (a)
          the attorney admission fee prescribed in Item 11 of the District Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule
          does not apply to pro hac vice requests or renewals of attorney admission to practice; (b) local
          courts may charge, at their option, a local fee above the $50 fee for original admission of attorneys
          to practice, and a fee for pro hac vice admissions and for renewals of an attorney's admission to
          practice; and (c) revenues from local fees may be deposited into a district's local non-appropriated
          funds account.

               The Judicial Conference also approved the recommendation of the Court Administration and
          Case Management Committee that two revisions to the Miscellaneous Fee Schedule for the
          Bankruptcy Courts also be made to similar items in the District Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule.

          The fee for exemplification of any document or paper is increased (Item 3), and the fee for
          "transcribing a record of any proceeding by a regularly employed member of the court staff" is
          eliminated (Item 6). The amended items read as follows:

                Item 3: For certification of any document or paper, whether the certification is made directly
                on the document or by separate instrument, $5. For exemplification of any document or paper,
                twice the amount of the fee for certification.

                Item 6: Repealed

          In addition, the Conference approved for the District Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule an increase
          to $35 for retrieval of a record from a Federal Records Center, National Archives, or other storage
          location removed from the place of business of the court (Item 8), provided legislation is enacted
          permitting the judiciary to retain the increase.

                Court of Appeals and Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. As was done for the
          bankruptcy and district courts, the Judicial Conference agreed to raise the fee for retrieval of an
          archived record from $25 to $35 for the courts of appeals (Item 8) and for the Judicial Panel on
          Multidistrict Litigation (Item 4). This action will be taken upon enactment of legislation permitting
          the judiciary to retain the increase.

                 Bankruptcy Appellate Panels. Although authorized to establish miscellaneous fee schedules
          for the appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, and the Judicial
          Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1913, 1914, 1926, 1930, and 1932), the Judicial
          Conference does not have authority to establish a separate fee schedule for bankruptcy appellate
          panels (BAPs) established under 28 U.S.C. ยง 158(b)(1). Moreover, the clerks of the BAPs do not
          have the statutory authority to collect and pay fees into the Treasury. In order to establish a
          mechanism for collecting fees and ensure that courts charge the same fees for similar services, the
          Judicial Conference approved a Committee recommendation that it direct the Administrative Office
          to issue interim guidance to all bankruptcy appellate panel clerks to use the Miscellaneous Fee
          Schedule for the Courts of Appeals in determining which fees to charge for services provided to the
          public. All such fees will be collected by the clerk of the court of appeals for the circuit in which the
          BAP exists.

                 Search Fee Guidelines. In 1993, the Judicial Conference approved search fee guidelines to
          be utilized in connection with the $15 fee for a search of court records imposed under the
          miscellaneous fee schedules for the district and bankruptcy courts in order to provide guidance to
          the courts and promote uniformity in the application of the fee (JCUS-MAR 93, p. 11). In light of
          numerous inquiries regarding the guidelines and policy changes, it appears necessary to revise the
          guidelines to address common questions and clarify certain issues. On recommendation of the
          Committee on Court Administration and Case Management, the Judicial Conference delegated
          authority to the Committee to approve certain revisions to the search fee guidelines and all future
          revisions.

                 Waivers in Natural Disaster Emergencies. The Judicial Conference has adopted a general
          policy to allow a waiver of the miscellaneous fees associated with obtaining copies of documents
          required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in applying for emergency aid in pending
          cases (JCUS-MAR 95, p. 15). This year, due to spring flooding in North Dakota, it was necessary
          for the Executive Committee to consider a request, not covered by the Conference policy, for a
          waiver of copy fees for lawyers who needed to reconstruct their files in pending cases (see supra,


RPJC Sep 1997                                                                                       Page 11 of 26
          "Miscellaneous Actions," p. 50). In order to save time during disasters and avoid piecemeal
          requests, the Judicial Conference approved a Committee recommendation to delegate authority to
          the Director of the Administrative Office to grant waivers of miscellaneous fees, excluding filing
          fees, following a natural disaster for a set period of time not to exceed one year, upon the request of
          the chief judge of the affected court.

          ___________________
          STATUTORY FEE CHANGES

                Bankruptcy Court. Under current law, if a bankruptcy case filed under chapter 7 or 13 is
          converted to chapter 11, a fee of $400 is collected; yet the current fee for filing a bankruptcy case
          under chapter 11 is $800. To correct this inconsistency, the Court Administration and Case
          Management Committee, with input from the Bankruptcy Committee, recommended that legislation
          be sought to amend 28 U.S.C. ยง 1930(a) to increase the amount of the fee for converting a chapter 7
          or 13 case to a case under chapter 11 so that the petitioner will pay the same total fees as if the case
          had originally commenced under chapter 11. The Judicial Conference approved the
          recommendation. It is suggested that the allocation of this fee be the same as if the case were
          originally filed as a chapter 11 case, i.e., apportioned among the U.S. Trustee System Fund, the
          judiciary's Salaries and Expenses account, and the U.S. Treasury's General Fund.

                Similarly, the Judicial Conference approved a Committee recommendation to seek legislation
          to amend 28 U.S.C. ยง 1930(a)(2) to increase the chapter 9 filing fee to the same amount as provided
          in 28 U.S.C. ยง 1930(a)(3) for commencing a case under chapter 11, provided legislation is enacted
          to permit the judiciary to retain the resulting increase in fees.

                In addition, the Judicial Conference approved a recommendation of the Court Administration
          and Case Management Committee that it seek legislation to amend the statute that currently permits
          the judiciary to retain revenue from all fees after Item 18 of the Miscellaneous Fee Schedule for the
          Bankruptcy Courts so that the judiciary can continue to retain those fees now retained and any
          newly created fees, without reference to a specific number in the fee schedule.

                 Court of Federal Claims. Under the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 (Public Law
          No. 97-164) the Judicial Conference has the authority to prescribe fees to be charged by the Court of
          Federal Claims. Pursuant to that authority, in September 1996, the Conference raised to $150 the
          filing fee for the Court of Federal Claims, provided legislation was enacted permitting the judiciary
          to keep the increase (JCUS-SEP 96, p. 54). Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2520, the filing fee that can be
          charged by the Court of Federal Claims appears to be limited to $120; however, this statute predates
          the 1982 Federal Courts Improvement Act and is no longer necessary. On recommendation of the
          Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to propose legislation to repeal 28 U.S.C. ยง 2520.

                 Fees for Technology Resources. Under section 404 of Public Law No. 101-151, the Judicial
          Conference shall prescribe reasonable fees to be collected by the federal courts for providing public
          access to information available in electronic form. This authority does not appear to extend to
          charging fees for the use of other technology provided by the courts (e.g., teleconferencing,
          electronic filing, and evidence presentation). The Judicial Conference approved a Committee
          recommendation to seek legislation that would:

          a. Authorize the Judicial Conference to prescribe reasonable fees for use of information technology
          resources provided by the courts for improved access to, and efficiency of, the court;

          b. Authorize the courts to collect and retain those fees for deposit into the Judiciary Information
          Technology Fund; and

          c. Make the fees so deposited available to the Director of the Administrative Office, without fiscal
          year limitation, for reinvestment in information technology resources for purposes of improved
          court access and efficiency.

          DIGITAL AUDIO COURT RECORDING

                 Digital audio recording is a computer-based system with features similar to audio recording
          systems, except that the recorded proceedings are stored and retrieved through the use of a
          computer, requiring specialized hardware and software. Potential benefits associated with the use of
          digital audio recording include: enhanced sound quality; immediate and remote access to segments
          of the record; savings in storage space; and for simultaneous recording, playback, note-taking and
          transcribing capabilities for users. As a new method of taking the record, digital audio recording
          cannot be utilized, even on an experimental basis, without Judicial Conference approval. Since it has
          been the practice of the Judicial Conference to test new methods of court reporting before approving
          their use on a permanent basis, the Conference approved a Committee on Court Administration and
          Case Management recommendation that it:

          a. Authorize the use of digital audio recording equipment as a method of recording court
          proceedings for the limited purpose of studying its use in selected courtrooms;

          b. Authorize a study of digital audio recording during a one-year period in a minimum of two
          district, two magistrate judge, and two bankruptcy courtrooms; and

          c. Delegate authority to the Court Administration and Case Management Committee to select the
          study courts, with the recognition that courts selected for this study may be participating in other
          ongoing study efforts, such as the Electronic Courtroom Project of the Committee on Automation
          and Technology.

          CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM ACT

                Statistical Reporting. In March 1997, the Judicial Conference, in approving its final Civil
          Justice Reform Act (CJRA) report to Congress, determined that the CJRA public reporting
          requirements should remain in effect beyond the Act's sunset date (JCUS-MAR 97, pp. 15-16). To
          ensure more accurate and consistent statistical reporting in and among districts, the Judicial
          Conference, at this session, approved a recommendation of the Court Administration and Case
          Management Committee that it require courts to use a new ICMS/CJRA software program (Release
          96CJ01) beginning with the reporting of statistics relating to pending motions, bench trials, and
          three-year-old cases for the period ending March 31, 1998.

                Role of Chief Judge. In October 1971, the Judicial Conference adopted a report entitled
          "Program for Prompt Disposition of Protracted, Difficult, or Widely Publicized Cases," that
          provided specific powers to the chief judge to ensure the prompt disposition of cases (JCUS-OCT
          71, pp. 71-74). Although the program is not widely known and is rarely used, the Committee on
          Court Administration and Case Management was of the view that it is valuable in the management
          of cases. On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference reaffirmed its October
          1971 adoption of the report.

          3321 to reduce federal grand juries to not less than nine nor more than thirteen persons, and require
          seven jurors to concur in the return of an indictment, as long as at least nine jurors were present.


RPJC Sep 1997                                                                                      Page 13 of 26
          Although this proposal would result in cost savings for the judiciary, the Court Administration and
          Case Management Committee was of the view that there are also numerous non-monetary
          considerations that must be taken into account and that any proposed change to decrease the size of
          grand juries should be aired through the deliberative rulemaking process. The Judicial Conference
          approved a recommendation of the Committee that the Conference take no position at this time on
          H.R. 1536, related to the size of grand juries, and refer the issue to the Committee on Rules of
          Practice and Procedure for consideration under the Rules Enabling Act rulemaking process.

          JUDICIAL REFORM ACT OF 1997

                 In May 1997, the Judicial Conference considered by mail ballot three sections of the draft
          Judicial Reform Act of 1997 (H.R. 1252, 105th Congress), that would have a major impact on the
          judiciary (see infra, "Judicial Reform Act of 1997," pp. 71 and 81-82, and "Mail Ballots," pp. 84-
          85). The proposed bill was subsequently revised, and the Committee on Court Administration and
          Case Management made recommendations concerning a number of new or revised provisions of the
          bill. The Conference approved the recommendations of the Committee and agreed to (a) continue to
          oppose the proposed revision to 28 U.S.C. ยง 464 concerning the reassignment of a civil case as a
          matter of right upon motion by a party; (b) oppose section 7 of the bill, regarding random
          assignment of habeas corpus cases, because it would limit the flexibility of the courts to administer
          court operations in the most efficient and effective way; and (c) oppose section 8 of the bill,
          regarding the authority of the individual presiding judge to allow cameras in the appellate courts,
          because it is contrary to Conference policy, which gives each appellate court the authority to
          determine whether to permit cameras in the courtroom.

        JUVENILE CRIME LEGISLATION

                 In Congress' last two sessions, juvenile crime has become a priority issue, and the chairs of
          the Committee on Criminal Law have written to members of Congress expressing the Committee's
          concerns on a number of legislative proposals dealing with juvenile crime. The Committee
          recommended that the Judicial Conference itself go on record as opposing the unwarranted
          federalization of juvenile crime, a position which is a logical and consistent application of the
          Conference's longstanding opposition to federalization of crime traditionally prosecuted at the state
          and local levels. The Judicial Conference agreed to (a) reaffirm its long-standing position that
          criminal prosecutions should be limited to those offenses that cannot or should not be prosecuted in
          state courts; (b) affirm that this policy is particularly applicable to the prosecution of juveniles; and
          (c) endorse the concerns previously expressed by the Committee on Criminal Law to Congress
          regarding recent juvenile crime legislation. See also infra, "Juvenile Crime Legislation," p. 70.

          PRETRIAL SERVICES OFFICES

                 In an effort to determine whether savings could be achieved by providing pretrial services
          through probation offices rather than separate pretrial services offices, the Committee on Criminal
          Law undertook an analysis of the management and administrative support in the 42 courts with
          separate offices. After full consideration of the results of the analysis, the Committee recommended,
          and the Judicial Conference agreed, to affirm the principle that decisions regarding the form of
          organization with which to provide pretrial services should continue to be made by individual
          district courts and their respective circuit councils. The Conference also authorized the distribution
          of the Committee on Criminal Law's Report on the Study of Savings in Probation and Pretrial
          Services to all chief district judges and chief probation and pretrial services officers.

          FICTITIOUS LIENS AGAINST JUDICIAL OFFICERS

                  The practice of filing fictitious liens against judicial officers and federal officials, in an effort
          to harass, is a long-standing one. The Department of Justice, which is charged through its United
          States attorneys' offices to represent federal officials in response to these liens, has indicated that it
          is in the process of drafting legislation that would make it a federal offense to file a fictitious
          harassing lien. On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, the Judicial Conference
          agreed to support legislation to be proposed by the Department of Justice that would create a new
          federal criminal offense for harassing or intimidating a federal official, including a judicial officer,
          with respect to the performance of official duties, including filing a lien on the real or personal
          property of that government official.

          VICTIMS' RIGHTS LEGISLATION

                 In March 1997, the Judicial Conference determined to take no position on a proposed victims'
          rights constitutional amendment at that time, but authorized the Committee on Criminal Law, with
          the help of the Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction and in consultation with the Chair of the
          Executive Committee, to maintain contact with Congress to make known the concerns of the
          judiciary on the impact of the amendment (JCUS-MAR 97, p. 21). No position was taken on a
          statutory approach to victims' rights. Subsequently, the Conference was asked for its views on
          victims' rights legislation proposed as an alternative to a constitutional amendment. On
          recommendation of the Criminal Law Committee, the Conference approved by mail ballot
          concluded on April 14, 1997, transmittal of a letter to Congress expressing a strong preference for a
          statutory approach to victims' rights over a constitutional amendment. The Conference took no
          position on the specifics of the proposed legislation. See infra, "Mail Ballots," pp. 84-85.

        DEATH PENALTY REPRESENTATION

                 As part of its continuing effort to contain the cost of federal capital habeas corpus litigation,
          the Defender Services Committee, while acknowledging variation among the circuits in local legal
          culture and state court practice, recommended establishment of a further mechanism (in addition to
          the sound discretion of the presiding judicial officer) to ensure that Criminal Justice Act (CJA)
          expenditures in capital habeas corpus cases are reasonable. The Judicial Conference agreed to urge
          each circuit judicial council to establish a special process for review of any state death penalty
          habeas corpus case within the circuit in which attorney compensation exceeds $100,000. Each
          circuit judicial council should notify the Judicial Conference of the procedures adopted by providing
          a written copy to the Conference Secretary.

          DISCLOSURE OF COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEYS' FEES

                The Disclosure of Court Appointed Attorneys' Fees and Taxpayer Right to Know Act of 1997
          (S. 598, 105th Congress) would amend the CJA to require public disclosure of attorneys' fees,
          including payment vouchers, upon their approval by the court. Judges would be required to disclose
          CJA payment information during the pendency of a case. The CJA currently provides for the
          disclosure of "amounts paid" rather than actual vouchers and does not indicate the timing of the
          disclosure. The Defender Services Committee expressed a number of concerns with the bill,
          including the extent of detail required to be disclosed, the timing of the disclosure, and the bill's
          potential limitation on judicial discretion in this area. On recommendation of the Committee, the
          Judicial Conference determined to take no position on S. 598, but to provide information to

          CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE REFORM ACT

                 The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (H.R. 1965, 105th Congress) would, among other
          things, give courts discretion to appoint counsel to represent financially eligible claimants in civil
          asset forfeiture proceedings and to approve compensation at rates equivalent to those provided for
          representation under the CJA; authorize the appropriation of additional funds under the CJA for
          such purpose; and afford the government an opportunity to present evidence and examine the
          claimant at a required hearing to determine whether to appoint counsel. A number of issues are
          implicated in this legislative proposal including how funding for appointed counsel will be provided
          and whether counsel may be provided prior to the hearing regarding appointment of counsel. On
          recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to communicate the following to
          Congress:

                (1) Its preference that, consistent with current Conference policy expressed in the proposed
                Federal Courts Improvement Act (H.R. 2294, 105th Congress), the judiciary be reimbursed
                from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund and the Department of Treasury Asset
                Forfeiture Fund for representational services provided in civil asset forfeiture proceedings
                under H.R. 1965; and

                (2) The necessity, if such services are to be paid from the Defender Services appropriation,
                that sufficient additional funds be appropriated for that purpose;

                b. That important considerations flow from the government's role in examining a claimant at
                the hearing regarding appointment of counsel under H.R. 1965. Claimants may need counsel
                at such hearings to protect their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Sixth
                Amendment right to counsel, which would add to the cost of furnishing representation.
                Although H.R. 1965 does not contemplate the appointment of counsel before that hearing, the
                bill should permit such appointment where there is reason to believe that the claimant could
                be subject to a criminal prosecution, civil or criminal contempt, or loss of liberty (see
                paragraph 2.01F(2) of the Guidelines for the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act); and

                c. That due to the potential scope and duration of services which might be required of counsel,
                the bill should provide that the case compensation maximum applicable to the appointment of
                counsel for a person charged with a felony under the CJA should apply to the appointment of
                counsel pursuant to H.R. 1965 for a claimant in a civil asset forfeiture proceeding.

        NATIONAL JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS

                 In 1990, the Judicial Conference and the Conference of Chief Justices (CCJ) approved the
          creation of the National Judicial Council of State and Federal Courts (JCUS-MAR 90, p. 18). The
          Council was established to consider matters referred to it by the Judicial Conference or the CCJ


RPJC Sep 1997                                                                                     Page 16 of 26
          relating to issues of mutual concern to the state and federal courts; advise the Judicial Conference
          and the CCJ on improving the relationship between the two court systems; and seek methods to
          enhance the operations of the local state-federal judicial councils. During much of its existence, the
          Council struggled with defining its unique responsibilities in the state and federal judicial systems,
          and it has been inactive since 1994. On recommendation of the Federal-State Jurisdiction
          Committee, the Judicial Conference joined the CCJ in agreeing to abolish the National Judicial
          Council of State and Federal Courts, understanding that the work of the Council will be continued
          by the Judicial Conference Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction and the State-Federal Relations
          Committee of the CCJ.

          JUVENILE CRIME LEGISLATION

                 Several legislative proposals pending in the 105th Congress would enhance the opportunities
          for prosecuting juveniles in federal court, either as juveniles or as adults, and would expand federal
          criminal jurisdiction over gang-related activity. The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction
          concurred in the recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, approved by the Judicial
          Conference at this session, that juvenile prosecutions in federal court should be limited to those that
          cannot or should not be prosecuted in state courts (see supra "Juvenile Crime Legislation," p. 65).
          As a supplement to that position, on recommendation of the Federal-State Jurisdiction Committee,
          the Judicial Conference recognized that the appropriate age for prosecuting juveniles as adults in
          federal court for a violation of federal law is a policy matter to be determined by Congress.
          ______________________
          PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS LEGISLATIONS

                 The Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 1997 (H.R. 1534, 105th Congress) is
          intended to "simplify and expedite access to the Federal courts for injured parties whose rights and
          privileges, secured by the United States Constitution, have been deprived by final actions of federal
          agencies or other government officials or entities acting under color of state law." The Committee
          on Federal-State Jurisdiction identified issues in this novel legislation. The bill would alter deeply
          ingrained federalism principles by prematurely involving the federal courts in property regulatory
          matters that have historically been processed at the state and local levels. The bill may also
          adversely affect the administration of justice and delay the resolution of property claims. For
          example, H.R. 1534 would: restrict the use of the abstention doctrine in takings, as well as non-
          takings, cases; codify the takings provisions within 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343, which may create confusion
          because of the availability of the general jurisdictional statute, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331; and result in
          imprudent or inefficient procedures because of the restrictions on the use of the abstention doctrine
          and the liberalization of the requirement of ripeness. The Judicial Conference approved the
          Committee's recommendation to express these concerns to Congress regarding the proposed
          legislation.
          _______________________
          JUDICIAL REFORM ACT OF 1997

                 Section 2 of the Judicial Reform Act of 1997 (H. R. 1252, 105th Congress) would require
          three-judge panels to consider applications for interlocutory or permanent injunctions restraining, on
          the ground of unconstitutionality, the enforcement, operation or execution of state laws adopted by
          referendum. In addition, these three-judge panels would be required to expedite consideration of
          applications for injunctions, and their decisions would be appealable directly to the Supreme Court.
          At its September 1995 session, the Judicial Conference unanimously opposed an identical provision
          and reaffirmed its longstanding opposition to three-judge panels generally (JCUS-SEP 95, pp. 83-
          85). In taking this position, the Conference recognized that it would likely apply in only a limited
          number of cases. In a mail ballot concluded on May 9, 1997, the Judicial Conference voted to
          adhere to its 1995 position and to oppose section 2 of H. R. 1252. See infra, "Mail Ballots," pp. 84-
          85.

                 Section 5 of the Judicial Reform Act of 1997 would prohibit a district court from entering any
          order or approving any settlement that requires a state or political subdivision of a state to impose,
          increase, levy, or assess any tax for the purpose of enforcing any federal or state common law, or
          any statutory or constitutional right or law, unless the court makes certain findings. The Committee
          on Federal-State Jurisdiction recommended that the Judicial Conference oppose section 5 of H. R.
          1252 because it may interfere with the ability of federal courts to fulfill their obligation to enforce
          remedies required by statute and to fashion appropriate remedies for constitutional violations. The
          Committee also noted that section 5 raises serious problems of judicial administration. By mail
          ballot, the Judicial Conference concurred with the Committee and voted to oppose section 5. See
          infra, "Mail Ballots," pp. 84-85.

          tirelessly to obtain an adequate level of compensation for the federal judiciary, the Judicial
          Conference approved the following resolution:

                That federal judges, Members of Congress, and top officials in the executive branch should

                receive a cost-of-living salary adjustment, as provided by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.
                Such an adjustment to the compensation of these officials is necessary to protect them from
                increases in the cost-of-living that have occurred since their last such adjustment in January
                1993.

          CERTIFICATION OF SENIOR JUDGES

                 The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996 (Public Law No. 104-317) amended 28 U.S.C.
          ยง 371(f) to permit a senior judge to obtain retroactive certification as eligible for salary increases
          when additional workload in a subsequent year is sufficient to offset reduced workload in a prior
          year. In addition, the Act permits retired judges to aggregate administrative work with judicial work,
          although only one-half of the administrative work performed by a judge may be aggregated. On
          recommendation of the Committee on the Judicial Branch, the Judicial Conference approved
          conforming amendments to the Rules for Certification of Senior Judges, which are published in the
          Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, Vol III, Ch. VII. The revised rules leave circuit chief
          judges ample discretion to implement the certification process.

          JUDGES' TRAVEL REGULATIONS

                 Non-Prescribed Meetings. Under the Travel Regulations for United States Justices and
          Judges (published in the Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, Vol. III, Ch. XV), official
          travel generally falls into three categories: judicial sittings, prescribed meetings, and other travel. A
          judge needs no advance authorization to travel for judicial sittings or for prescribed meetings, such
          as Judicial Conference committee meetings, but with respect to other travel, the travel regulations
          have dealt only with certain types of non-prescribed meetings, such as meetings of judges'
          associations and bar associations, and have not contemplated others, such as meetings between
          government agencies (foreign, federal, state, or local), universities, community organizations, and
          other entities. The Committee on the Judicial Branch recommended that the Judicial Conference
          amend the Travel Regulations for Justices and Judges to address the issue of how, as well as how
          many, judges may be designated as spokespersons for the judiciary at a non-prescribed meeting; to
          provide for approval by the chair of the Executive Committee when more than one judge is
          designated to travel abroad at judiciary expense; and to eliminate the necessity for clearance of the
          travel by the Director of the Administrative Office. The Conference approved the recommendation.

                 Senior Judges. Section 374 of title 28, United States Code, relieves a retired judge of any
          restrictions as to his or her residence and establishes that the judge's official station for purposes of
          computation of travel expenses shall be the city or town where he or she actually lives, whether or
          not court is held at such place. This provision enables a senior judge sitting by designation and
          assignment to be reimbursed for travel expenses commensurate with the distance actually traveled
          from home to the place of assignment and was intended to encourage the utilization of the services
          of retired judges and overcome their reluctance to accept assignments away from their homes.
          Although unaware of any abuse of the present reimbursement mechanism, the Committee was
          concerned about the potential unfavorable perceptions of it by those who are not knowledgeable
          about the generous workload contributions of senior judges. The Committee recommended, and the
          Conference approved, an amendment to the judges' travel regulations to require that a senior judge
          who has a principal residence outside the jurisdiction of the court to which the senior judge is
          designated and assigned (the "home court"), including a judge who resides outside the United States
          and its territories, be prohibited from receiving reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses
          for travel back to the judge's home court unless such travel is cleared by the chief judge of the
          circuit in which the judge was commissioned.

                 Under current law, judges in regular active service, unlike other federal employees who are
          military retirees, do not have contributions made to the Military Survivor Benefit Plan on their
          behalf from the military retirement fund. To correct this anomaly, the Judicial Conference approved
          a recommendation of the Committee that legislation be pursued to amend 28 U.S.C. ยง 371 to
          provide for contributions to be made to the Military Survivor Benefit Plan from a judge's military
          retired pay before the balance of such pay is returned to the United States Treasury as required by
          law.

          PARTICIPATION IN THE MILITARY READY RESERVE

                The Department of Defense is updating a longstanding directive which provides that federal
          employees who occupy key positions (including the Vice President, Members of Congress, and
          Article III judges) shall be transferred from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve or Retired
          Reserve or, where appropriate, discharged. It requested the judiciary's comments. On
          recommendation of the Committee on the Judicial Branch, the Judicial Conference agreed to
          respond to this request by suggesting that an exception be included in Department of Defense
          Directive 1200.7 that would allow an Article III judge to continue to be a member of the Ready
          Reserve upon certification by the chief judge of the affected judge's circuit that the mobilization of
          the Article III judge concerned will not seriously impair the capability of the judge's court to
          function effectively.

     COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES
        __________________
        CIRCUIT EXECUTIVES' OFFICES

                 In September 1991, the Judicial Conference approved a staffing methodology and staffing
          ceiling for circuit executives' offices. The ceiling was subsequently adjusted to include additional
          positions. Three permanent positions above the ceiling were requested (one in the Third Circuit and
          two in the Eighth Circuit), but the Committee on Judicial Resources recommended that only one
          three-year temporary position (for the Eighth Circuit) be approved beginning in fiscal year 1999.
          The Judicial Conference approved the Committee's recommendation.
          _________________________________
          COURT PERSONNEL SYSTEM QUALIFICATIONS STANDARDS

                 In September 1993, the Judicial Conference approved development of the Court Personnel
          System, which lets courts request delegated authority for personnel actions involving classification,
          qualifications and compensation, but does not permit exceptions to qualification standards (JCUS-
          SEP 93, pp. 49-50). In response to requests from court unit executives, the Judicial Resources
          Committee recommended and the Judicial Conference agreed to permit the following exceptions to
          be made to the qualifications standards, except for minimum educational requirements for
          professional line positions, on a case-by-case basis for the following Court Personnel System
          positions: (1) those subject to recruitment difficulties as evidenced by high turnover, lack of
          qualified applicants, etc.; and (2) those for which the applicant has legal, paralegal, or graduate
          education directly related to the position to be filled. The Administrative Office will grant these
          exceptions for the first year with the understanding that future delegation to the courts is possible.

          EARLY RETIREMENT AUTHORITY

                 In fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the Office of Personnel Management approved an "early-out"
          retirement authority for use by the judiciary. This authority has proven to be a useful management
          tool for many court units in the restructuring of their organizations. The Judicial Conference
          approved a Judicial Resources Committee recommendation to authorize all court units in fiscal year
          1998 to offer early retirement to eligible employees in order to facilitate reorganization as a result of


RPJC Sep 1997                                                                                       Page 20 of 26
          budget restrictions, workload changes, or other good management reasons. Implementation of this
          action is contingent upon a grant of authority by the Office of Personnel Management.

          STUDENT LABOR

                 The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) set 14 years as the lowest
          age for employing students. Although judiciary practices comply with these child labor provisions
          of the FLSA, written policies in the Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures fail to reflect
          current practices. Specifically, the judiciary's written policy on age restrictions sets 16 as the
          minimum age for employing students. In addition, the FLSA sets detailed rules on when students
          may work, while the judiciary policy has a more general rule for student workers. Because the
          judiciary has stated in its report on the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) that its practices
          comply with the child labor provisions of the FLSA (see Study of Judicial Branch Coverage
          Pursuant to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, December, 1996), the Judicial
          Conference approved a Committee recommendation that a technical amendment be made to the
          Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures to mirror the FLSA requirements with respect to age
          and hours of employment of student employees.

          REALTIME COURT REPORTING

                 In March 1996, the Judicial Conference approved realtime transcript rates, with the fee paid
          for an unedited realtime transcript, set at $2.50 per page, to be credited towards the certified
          transcript fee (JCUS-MAR 96, p. 26). Concerns have been expressed that this rate structure has not
          offered court reporters adequate incentive to provide realtime services. On recommendation of the
          Judicial Resources Committee, the Judicial Conference approved a modification to the transcript fee
          rates for realtime unedited transcripts provided by certified realtime reporters to establish the
          maximum page rate authorized for the provision of realtime services, including the production and
          distribution of a realtime unedited transcript, to be $1 per page. Litigants who order realtime
          services, and subsequently order an original certified transcript of the same proceeding, will not
          receive a credit toward the purchase cost of the certified transcript.

     COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
     OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGES SYSTEM
         _____________________
         AD HOC RECALL REGULATIONS

                 The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System recommended that the
          ad hoc recall regulations for magistrate judges be revised to clarify that certain magistrate judges
          recalled on less than a full-time basis may continue to practice law while on recall status, subject to
          the limitations set forth in the Code of Conduct for United States Judges governing part-time
          judicial officers and the Conflict-of-Interest Rules for Part-Time Magistrate Judges. The Judicial
          Conference approved the recommendation, amending section 3 of the Regulations of the Judicial
          Conference of the United States Establishing Standards and Procedures for the Recall of United
          States Magistrate Judges to state that a retired magistrate judge recalled to serve under 28 U.S.C. ยง
          636(h) on less than a full-time basis who has retired under chapter 83 or 84 of title 5, United States
          Code, shall be subject to 28 U.S.C. ยง 632(b) which deals with part-time magistrate judges, the Code
          of Conduct for United States Judges governing part-time magistrate judges, and the Conflict-of-
          Interest Rules for Part-Time Magistrate Judges.

     COMMITTEE TO REVIEW CIRCUIT COUNCIL CONDUCT AND DISABILITY ORDERS
        _____________________
        JUDICIAL REFORM ACT OF 1997

                 The Committee to Review Circuit Council Conduct and Disability Orders reported that it has
          been following closely the progress of two legislative proposals in the 105th Congress that would
          amend the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 372(c). H.R. 702 and section 4 of the
          original version of the Judicial Reform Act of 1997 (H.R. 1252) would provide that any complaint
          of judicial misconduct or disability filed under the Act shall be referred to another circuit for
          complaint proceedings. On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference, in a mail
          ballot, expressed opposition to the provision (see infra, "Mail Ballots," pp. 84-85). The Committee
          will continue to monitor these legislative proposals.

                 The Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules completed a style revision project to clarify and
          simplify the language of the appellate rules. The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure
          concurred with the advisory committee's recommendations and submitted revisions of all 48 Rules
          of Appellate Procedure and a revision of Form 4, together with Committee Notes explaining their
          purpose and intent. The Judicial Conference approved the proposed amendments to Appellate Rules
          1 to 48 and to Form 4 and agreed to transmit them to the Supreme Court for its consideration with
          the recommendation that they be adopted by the Court and transmitted to Congress in accordance
          with the law.

          FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE

                 The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the Judicial Conference
          proposed revisions to Official Bankruptcy Forms 1 (Voluntary Petition), 3 (Application and Order
          to Pay Filing Fee in Installments), 6 (Schedule F), 8 (Chapter 7 Individual Debtor's Statement of
          Intention), 9A-9I (Notice of Commencement of Case Under the Bankruptcy Code, Meeting of
          Creditors and Fixing of Dates), 10 (Proof of Claim), 14 (Ballot for Accepting or Rejecting a Plan),
          17 (Notice of Appeal from a Judgment, Order, or Decree of a Bankruptcy Judge), and 18 (Discharge
          of Debtor), and new Forms 20A (Notice of Motion or Objection) and 20B (Notice of Objection to
          Claim). The revisions mainly clarify or simplify existing forms. The Judicial Conference approved
          the proposed revisions to official bankruptcy forms. Implementation of the new forms will take
          effect immediately, but the superseded forms may also be used until March 1, 1998.

          FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

                The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the Judicial Conference a
          new Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), together with Committee Notes explaining its purpose
          and intent. This new subdivision would permit interlocutory appeal from an order granting or
          denying class action certification in the discretion of the court of appeals. The Judicial Conference
          approved the proposed new Civil Rule 23(f) and agreed to transmit it to the Supreme Court for its
          consideration with the recommendation that it be adopted by the Court and transmitted to Congress

          Witness Statements), 31 (Verdict), 33 (New Trial), 35 (Correction or Reduction of Sentence), and
          43 (Presence of the Defendant). The proposed amendments were accompanied by Committee Notes
          explaining their purpose and intent. The Judicial Conference approved the amendments and
          authorized their transmittal to the Supreme Court for its consideration with the recommendation that
          they be adopted by the Court and transmitted to Congress in accordance with the law.

          FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE

                The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the Judicial Conference a
          proposed amendment to Evidence Rule 615 (Exclusion of Witnesses) together with Committee
          Notes explaining its purpose and intent. The amendment would expand the list of witnesses who
          may not be excluded from attending a trial to include persons authorized by statute to attend, e.g., a
          victim defined in the Victim's Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and Victim Rights Clarification
          Act of 1997. The Judicial Conference approved the amendment and agreed to transmit it to the
          Supreme Court for its consideration with the recommendation that it be adopted by the Court and
          transmitted to Congress is accordance with the law.

     COMMITTEE ON SECURITY,
     SPACES AND FACILITIES
         _______________
         COURTHOUSE MANAGEMENT

                 In March 1988, the Judicial Conference approved guidelines for the establishment of
          delegations of authority from the General Services Administration for courts to manage and operate
          court facilities (JCUS-MAR 88, p. 40). Although Conference policy currently allows up to ten
          courts to participate in the delegated building management program (JCUS-SEP-89, pp. 81-82), it
          appears that many more courts may be interested in the program. On recommendation of the
          Committee on Security, Space and Facilities, the Judicial Conference agreed (a) to expand its policy
          limiting participation in the delegated building management program to ten courts and to allow any
          court meeting the Conference-approved conditions to participate in the program; and (b) to amend
          the conditions established in March 1988, under which courts may assume responsibilities for
          managing a court facility under a delegation of the General Services Administration's authority, by
          adding the following:

                All courts and court units occupying a building must approve a request for a delegation of
                General Services Administration's management and operations authority prior to submission
                of the request by the Administrative Office to the General Services Administration.

     MAIL BALLOTS

                The Judicial Conference completed two mail ballots since its last session. On April 14, 1997,
          the Conference concluded a ballot endorsing transmittal to Congress of a letter from the Chair of the
          Criminal Law Committee expressing the Conference's preference for a statutory approach, as
          opposed to a constitutional amendment, on victims' rights (see supra, "Victims' Rights Legislation,"
          pp. 66-67).

                 By mail ballot concluded on May 9, 1997, the Conference considered three sections (2, 4, and
          5) of a proposed Judicial Reform Act of 1997 (H.R. 1252, 105th Congress). The Conference voted


RPJC Sep 1997                                                                                      Page 25 of 26
          to adhere to its 1995 position in opposition to three-judge panels generally and to oppose section 2,
          which would require that three-judge panels consider challenges to state laws adopted by referenda
          (see supra, "Judicial Reform Act of 1997," p. 71). In the same ballot, Conference members voted to
          oppose section 4, which would amend the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act to provide that
          complaints under the Act be referred to another circuit for proceedings (see supra, "Judicial Reform
          Act of 1997," pp. 81-82), and also to oppose section 5, which would limit court-imposed taxation.
          See also supra, "Judicial Reform Act of 1997," pp. 64-65.

     FUNDING

                All of the foregoing recommendations which require the expenditure of funds for
          implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to the availability of funds, and
          subject to whatever priorities the Conference might establish for the use of available resources.
