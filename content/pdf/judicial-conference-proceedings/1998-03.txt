            RESOLUTION

                  On behalf of the Judicial Conference, the Executive Committee approved the following
            resolution honoring Chief Judge Richard S. Arnold for his service to the Judicial Conference:

                  The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with deep regret the departure from its
            ranks of our esteemed friend and colleague, the Honorable

                                                   RICHARD S. ARNOLD


                  Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and member of this
            body since 1992.

                  Recognized throughout the judiciary for his gifted intellect, integrity, and statesmanlike
            demeanor, Judge Arnold has contributed selflessly and immeasurably to the administration of the
            federal court system. From his leadership of the Conference's Budget Committee to his dedicated
            service on the Executive Committee, he has demonstrated unwavering good judgment and has
            earned our utmost respect and gratitude.

                   Judge Arnold is a gracious and warmhearted individual who does not hesitate to exercise his
            keen, dry wit in a manner that is always uplifting and constructive. He is an invaluable asset to the
            judiciary and a valued friend. We will sorely miss him at Conference sessions, but look forward to
            his significant future contributions to the judiciary.

                   It is our pleasure to pay tribute to Judge Richard Arnold and to express our sincere
            appreciation for his friendship and for his countless accomplishments in the administration of
            justice.

            ___________________
            MISCELLANEOUS ACTIONS

            The Executive Committee:

        ๏ฎ   Revised the fiscal year 1998 Salaries and Expenses financial plan to (a) authorize use of $9 million
            in reserve funds for priority space alterations projects, for which the judiciary anticipates receiving a
            reduction in rent from the General Services Administration (GSA); and (b) approve the use of $3.7
            million to fund additional temporary staffing resources for court units to meet short-term increases
            in workload associated with several automation systems and for financial duties resulting from
            recent legislation.

        ๏ฎ   Agreed, on recommendation of the Committee on Financial Disclosure, to support a legislative
            proposal that would allow the release of public financial disclosure forms to be deferred where the
            revealing of sensitive and personal information would endanger an individual judicial officer or
            employee. This position was subsequently modified by the Judicial Conference. See infra,
            "Financial Disclosure Reports," p. 16.

        ๏ฎ   Agreed, on recommendation of the Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges
            System, to increase the salary of the part-time magistrate judge position at Redding, California from
            Level 5 to Level 4, redesignate the part-time magistrate judge position at Redding as Redding or
            Susanville, and discontinue the part-time magistrate judge position at Susanville. See infra,

     COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

          _______________________
          COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                The Committee on the Administrative Office reviewed the progress of efforts to improve the
          Administrative Office's advisory structure. In addition, the Committee discussed the Federal Judicial
          Center's motions on training responsibilities and organizational relationships with the
          Administrative Office. The Committee was also briefed by AO executives on initiatives in the areas
          of public affairs, employee benefits, and information technology.

     COMMITTEE ON AUTOMATION AND TECHNOLOGY

          _________________________________
          LONG RANGE PLAN FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

                Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 612, the Committee on Automation and Technology recommended
          approval of the fiscal year 1998 update to the Long Range Plan for Information Technology in the
          Federal Judiciary (formerly entitled Long Range Plan for Automation in the Federal Judiciary).
          The Judicial Conference approved the recommendation.

          ____________________________
          LOCAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEES

                On recommendation of the Automation and Technology Committee, the Judicial Conference
          agreed to urge each court to consider creating a local information technology committee. These
          groups, generally comprised of judges and other court staff who represent all categories of
          information technology users, would facilitate training and communications on information
          technology issues, projects, and innovations.

     COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
     OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

          _______________________
          CHAPTER 7 FILING FEE WAIVER PROGRAM

                In the judiciary appropriations act for fiscal year 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103-121), Congress
          directed the Judicial Conference to study the effect of waiving the filing fee in Chapter 7 cases for
          individual debtors who are unable to pay the fee even in installments. At the request and under the
          guidance of the Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System, a study was conducted
          by the Federal Judicial Center. The report of the study, entitled Implementing and Evaluating the
          Chapter 7 Filing Fee Waiver Program, describes the implementation of the pilot program, projects
          the number of fee waiver applications and associated costs if a national program were to be
          implemented, and discusses issues to be addressed by subsequent legislation or rules if the program
          were implemented nationwide. On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
          approved the report for submission to Congress by March 31, 1998.

          ____________________________
          BANKRUPTCY CHIEF JUDGES

                Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 154(b), a chief judge of the bankruptcy court shall be designated in each


RPJC Mar 1998                                                                                     Page 6 of 22
          district court having more than one bankruptcy judge. Section 154(b) is silent on any tenure, age, or
          seniority criteria for appointing chief bankruptcy judges, and there is considerable variation among
          the district courts on these matters. In March 1994, the Judicial Conference tabled a
          recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee that it approve guidelines regarding the tenure of
          chief bankruptcy judges (JCUS-MAR 94, p. 11). At this session, the Conference approved a more
          limited proposal by the Committee that district courts be encouraged to appoint a chief bankruptcy
          judge for a set term of up to seven years, with the possibility of reappointment.

          ________________________
          BANKRUPTCY JUDGES' RETIREMENT REGULATIONS

                On recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee, the Judicial Conference approved
          amendments to sections 6.03 (concerning the offset of an annuity under the Judicial Retirement
          System to recover prior government contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan) and 12.02 (regarding
          continuation of coverage under the Judicial Survivors' Annuities System for a judge who retires on a
          deferred annuity) of the Regulations of the Director Implementing the Retirement and Survivors'
          Annuities for Bankruptcy Judges and Magistrates Act of 1988. The revisions will conform the
          guidelines to recent statutory amendments. See also infra, "Magistrate Judges' Retirement
          Regulations," p. 25.

     COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET

          _________________
          COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                The Committee on the Budget reported that the presentation of the judiciary's fiscal year 1999
          congressional budget request changed from previous years to align the request more closely with
          actual expenditures. This change is technical only and does not alter the budget formulation process
          nor the bottom line request. The new presentation is more accurate and easier to explain.

     COMMITTEE ON CODES OF CONDUCT

          ___________________________
          COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                 The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that since its last report to the Conference in
          September 1997, the Committee received 30 new written inquiries and issued 31 written advisory
          responses. During this period, the average response time for requests has been 23 days, excluding
          responses that are held for discussion at Committee meetings. The chairman received and responded
          to 22 telephonic inquiries. In addition, individual Committee members responded to 64 inquiries
          from their colleagues.

     COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
     AND CASE MANAGEMENT

          ____________________
          JUROR ATTENDANCE FEE

                The Court Administration and Case Management Committee considered ways to ease the
          burden of individuals for whom jury service is a financial hardship. Rather than seek an across-the-
          board increase in the $40 attendance fee for all jurors, the Committee determined to focus on the
          aggravated burden of jurors who serve on lengthy trials. Currently, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1871(b)(2) provides
          discretion for courts to pay an additional amount up to $10 in excess of the fee after 30 days of


RPJC Mar 1998                                                                                      Page 7 of 22
          service. On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to propose
          legislation to reduce from 30 to five the number of required days of attendance by jurors hearing one
          case in order to be eligible for the additional fee, as provided by ยง 1871(b)(2).

                 At its March 1997 session, the Judicial Conference strongly encouraged courts to enter into
          shared court facilities arrangements with state and local governments, or other entities, to reduce
          space rental costs (JCUS-MAR 97, p. 40). In an effort to provide guidance to courts implementing
          shared arrangements, the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management considered the
          implications of the Judicial Conference's policy on cameras in the courtroom when facilities are
          shared. The Committee recommended to the Conference, inter alia, that a state court using a federal
          court facility for a state judicial proceeding be permitted, at the discretion of the local court, to allow
          media cameras if authorized by state law. This recommendation was modified by the Judicial
          Conference, which approved the following:

                A federal judge who uses a state facility to conduct a federal proceeding is nevertheless bound by Judicial
                Conference policies, including the policy on cameras in the courtroom. The Judicial Conference policy on
                cameras in the courtroom also governs when a state court uses a federal facility to conduct state court judicial
                proceedings.

          COMBINING FUNCTIONS OF THE BANKRUOTCY AND
          DISTRICT COURT CLERKS' OFFICES

                 In September 1996, the Judicial Conference, after reviewing a report by the National
          Academy of Public Administration on administrative structures of the federal trial courts, agreed to
          encourage courts to examine their administrative delivery systems and consider more efficient
          structures for the provision of administrative services (JCUS-SEP 96, pp. 53-54). As a result, some
          courts began to consider reorganizing or combining the administrative or operational functions of
          the district and bankruptcy clerks' offices. Since consolidation of the two offices implicates 28
          U.S.C. ยง 156(d), which requires approval of the Judicial Conference and the Congress prior to a
          consolidation of the bankruptcy court clerk's office with the district court clerk's office, the
          Committee on Court Administration and Case Management determined that guidance should be
          provided to the courts on the issue of when administrative restructuring rises to the level of
          consolidation, thereby triggering the provisions of ยง 156(d). Working with the Bankruptcy
          Committee and after widespread distribution for comment, the Committee on Court Administration
          and Case Management recommended, and the Judicial Conference approved, procedures for
          combining functions of the clerks' offices in the district and bankruptcy courts. These procedures
          will be published in the Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures.

          _______________________________
          STATISTICAL REPORTING OF BANKRUPTCY APPEALS

                Under the present statistical reporting system for district courts, adopted in 1991 to meet the
          requirements of the Civil Justice Reform Act (CJRA), all motions pending over six months, all
          bench trials under submission for over six months, and all cases pending for over three years must
          be included in the statistical reports, which also include the names of the district judges and the case
          names and numbers. Appeals taken from orders and decrees issued by bankruptcy judges pursuant
          to 28 U.S.C. ยง 158 are not included in the present reporting system. In order to assist in directing
          judges' attention to bankruptcy appeals and avoid undue delays in providing finality to matters
          where delay can be financially detrimental to the parties, the Judicial Conference approved a Court
          Administration and Case Management Committee recommendation to


RPJC Mar 1998                                                                                                       Page 8 of 22
                a. Require the semi-annual public statistical reports now required by the Judicial Conference from the
                judges in the district courts to be expanded to include appeals to the district courts taken from orders
                and decrees issued by bankruptcy judges pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 158;

                b. Define the "pending date" for such appeals as 60 days from the date of the docketing of the appeal
                in the district court; and

                c. Require that all bankruptcy appeals pending over six months in the district courts be included in the
                reports.

          GRADUATED FEE STUDY

                 The judiciary appropriations act for fiscal year 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103-121) directed the
          Judicial Conference to study, in at least six judicial districts, the impact of a graduated fee system
          for cases filed under chapters 11 and 13 of title 11, United States Code. A study was conducted by
          the Administrative Office, and the resulting report was reviewed by both the Bankruptcy Committee
          and the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management. The Committees agreed with
          the conclusion of the report that the current fixed-fee filing system should not be replaced by a
          graduated fee system. On recommendation of the Court Administration and Case Management
          Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to transmit to Congress the report regarding graduated
          filing fees in the bankruptcy courts.

          CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM ACT

                 Under the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 471-478 (which include almost all
          of the substantive requirements of the Act) were scheduled to sunset on December 1, 1997.
          However, prior to the sunset date, Public Law No. 105-53 was enacted, which provides, in part, that
          ยง 476, dealing with statistical reporting, shall remain in effect permanently and that ยง 471 be deleted
          from the sunset provisions. Section 471 requires all 94 district courts to implement a civil justice
          expense and delay reduction plan, and all courts met this requirement by December 1993. Without
          the other six code sections that define the substantive and procedural standards of the CJRA
          program, which were allowed to expire, continued existence of ยง 471 is incongruous. On
          recommendation of the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management, the Judicial
          Conference agreed to propose legislation to amend section 103(b)(2)(A) of the Civil Justice Reform
          Act, as amended by Public Law No. 105-53, to reinstate the sunset provision's applicability to 28
          U.S.C. ยง 471.

     COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAW

          _______________________
          SENTENCING AUTHORITIES

                The Department of Justice has proposed amendments to five provisions of title 18, United
          States Code, 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 401 (criminal contempt), 1705 (destruction of letter boxes), 1916
          (unauthorized employment or disposition of lapsed appropriations), 2234 (willfully exceeding
          authority in executing a search warrant), and 2235 (maliciously procuring and executing a search
          warrant), each of which currently expressly provides for the imposition of imprisonment or a fine,
          but not both. The amendments, which would allow for a sentence of a fine, imprisonment or both,
          would permit a court the customary sentencing flexibility to impose both a fine and a prison term
          when appropriate. On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, the Judicial Conference
          concurred in the Department of Justice proposal to add the words "or both" at the appropriate place


RPJC Mar 1998                                                                                              Page 9 of 22

     COMMITTEE ON DEFENDER SERVICES

          _____________________
          QUALITY STEP INCREASES

                 Because the salary policies of federal public defender organizations (FPDOs) are based on
          those developed and used by the Department of Justice for United States Attorneys' offices (see 18
          U.S.C. ยง 3006(g)(2)(A)) and are independent of the district courts, employee awards and other
          methods used by the courts for recognizing judiciary employees have been unavailable to the
          FPDOs. The only exception to this is the quality step increase (QSI), which is also used in the
          United States Attorneys' offices. In fiscal year 1993, due to budgetary constraints, QSIs were
          suspended for judiciary employees, including FPDO personnel. On recommendation of the
          Committee on Defender Services, the Judicial Conference agreed to grant federal defenders the
          authority to reinstate Quality Step Increases for graded employees of federal defender organizations,
          to the same extent and within the same constraints as the offices of United States Attorneys.

          _____________________________
          CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT GUIDELINES

                 On revising the Guidelines for the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act and Related
          Statutes (CJA Guidelines), (Volume VII, Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures), to conform
          with congressional defunding of post-conviction defender organizations, the Committee on
          Defender Services determined to recommend further modifications to subparagraph 6.03C
          (Consulting Services in Capital Federal Habeas Corpus Cases and in Federal Capital Prosecutions)
          of the CJA guidelines, and the deletion of Appendix I (Qualification Standards for Designation of
          Expert Consultant Panels) of the CJA Guidelines to ensure the efficient use of expert attorney
          consultants. The Judicial Conference approved the recommended revisions which would, among
          other things, limit an expert attorney consultant to providing "light" consultation services, ensure
          that an expert attorney consultant shall not be paid an hourly rate exceeding that which an appointed
          counsel could be authorized to be paid, and replace the phrase "exhaustion of state remedies" with
          "determination of need to exhaust state remedies" in a list of examples of the type of work that may
          be performed by expert attorney consultants.

          ____________________
          REPRESENTATION IN STATE COURT

                 The Committee on Defender Services considered whether representation in state court to
          exhaust state remedies in capital habeas corpus proceedings is within the scope of a federal
          defender's representation pursuant to the CJA's "ancillary matters" authority, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3006A(c),
          or under 21 U.S.C. ยง 848(q). Acting under authority delegated to it by the Judicial Conference for
          approval of federal defender organization budgets and grants (JCUS-MAR 89, p. 19), the
          Committee adopted the position that, prospectively, CJA funds may not be expended to support
          legal representation in capital post-conviction proceedings in state court, except for the purpose of
          seeking a stay of execution to preserve the right to pursue federal habeas corpus. To extend
          comparable restrictions to the compensation of CJA panel attorneys, the Committee recommended
          that the Judicial Conference, prospectively, adopt the position that CJA funds may not be expended
          to support legal representation in capital post-conviction proceedings in state court, except for the
          purpose of seeking a stay of execution to preserve the right to pursue federal habeas corpus. The
          Judicial Conference declined to approve the Committee's recommendation.

     COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL -STATE
     JURISDICTION

          __________________
          VIRGIN ISLANDS DISTRICT COURT

                 In September 1997, the Third Circuit Judicial Council unanimously adopted a resolution
          urging the Judicial Conference to support Article III status for the District Court of the Virgin
          Islands, currently a territorial court established under Article IV of the Constitution. In recent years,
          the Conference has viewed "commonwealth" status as a significant factor in considering the
          justification for Article III status. See, e.g., JCUS-SEP 94, p. 51; JCUS-MAR 94, p. 19. The
          Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction carefully considered the Judicial Council's resolution and
          agreed that, although the Virgin Islands has not sought or been granted commonwealth status, it has
          permanent ties to the United States and enjoys many of the attributes of a state. Moreover, the
          adjudicatory role of the District Court of the Virgin Islands is virtually identical to that of other
          district courts and the need for judicial independence equally as strong. Thus, for these reasons, as
          well as the assertion that no additional costs would be required, the Committee recommended, and
          the Judicial Conference agreed, that the Conference support the Third Circuit Judicial Council
          resolution recommending that the District Court of the Virgin Islands be made an Article III court.

     COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

          ______________________
          FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REPORTS

                 Section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. app. 4, ยง 105), as amended,
          requires the release of financial disclosure reports to any member of the public who properly
          completes a request form and indicates that he or she understands the prohibitions on the use of the
          information contained in the report. Personal information not required by the statute is redacted
          prior to release, and judges are notified that their reports have been released. In response to security
          concerns when the safety of a particular judge is threatened, the United States Marshals Service
          drafted legislation to amend ยง 105 to defer the release of public financial disclosure forms where
          such a threat exists. Slightly modifying a recommendation of the Committee on Financial
          Disclosure, which had consulted with the Committee on Security and Facilities, the Judicial
          Conference agreed to support in principle enactment of legislation that would at least allow the
          release of financial disclosure forms to be deferred where the revealing of sensitive and personal
          information would endanger the individual judicial officer or employee. See also supra,
          "Miscellaneous Actions," p. 6.

                The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that during the period from July 1, 1997
          to December 31, 1997, a total of 75 intercircuit assignments, undertaken by 60 Article III judges,
          were processed and recommended by the Committee and approved by the Chief Justice. In addition
          the Committee aided courts requesting assistance in identifying judges willing to take assignments.
          The Committee further reported that the Chief Justice had approved its recommended changes to the
          Guidelines for the Intercircuit Assignment of Article III Judges, which have been distributed to all

          International Development, as approved by the Judicial Conference in September 1997 (JCUS-SEP
          97, pp. 72-73). Each program will be reviewed by the Executive Committee before implementation.

     COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

          ________________
          JUDICIAL COMPENSATION

                 In January 1997, the Judicial Conference unanimously endorsed the pursuit of legislation to
          accomplish the following objectives: (a) give judges a catch-up pay adjustment; (b) sever the
          linkage between judicial, congressional, and Executive Schedule compensation and substitute
          linking judges' salary adjustments to the mechanism for adjusting General Schedule pay rates; and
          (c) repeal section 140 of Public Law No. 97-92 (JCUS-MAR 97, pp. 26, 41). Subsequently
          Congress enacted legislation which enabled the judges to receive a 2.3 percent 1998 Employment
          Cost Index (ECI) adjustment. Believing that the judiciary should focus congressional and executive
          branch attention on the need to reestablish an institutional mechanism to deal with the impending
          problem of salary compression, the Committee on the Judicial Branch recommended, and the
          Judicial Conference adopted, a resolution to--

          a. Seek vigorously a cost-of-living adjustment for federal judges, Members of Congress, and top
          officials in the executive branch for 1999;

          b. Continue to seek the repeal of section 140 of Public Law No. 97-92; and

          c. Support the revitalization of a federal salary-fixing entity similar to the former Commission on
          Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries.

          FEDERAL EMPLOYEES GROUP LIFE INSURANCE

                 The Judicial Branch Committee made two recommendations relating to the Federal
          Employees Group Life Insurance Program (FEGLI): The first would increase the amount of
          supplemental additional coverage under Option B of the FEGLI program from the current limit of
          five times the employee's annual rate of pay or that of Executive Schedule Level II (whichever is
          lower); and the second would allow a re-employed annuitant to retain full FEGLI program Option B
          coverage after the completion of recall status. The Judicial Conference endorsed the concepts of
          these proposals.

          _____________
          JUDGES' TRAVEL

               In light of the inadequacy of the current judges' maximum daily subsistence allowance in a
          number of metropolitan areas that are experiencing a severe shortage of hotel rooms, the Judicial
          Conference approved a Judicial Branch Committee recommendation to increase by $25 the
          maximum daily subsistence allowance for judges' travel.

                The Committee was asked to consider a proposal by Senate Judiciary Subcommittee
          Chairman Charles Grassley that a provision be included in a bankruptcy judgeship bill which would
          require bankruptcy judges to seek pre- and post-travel approval of non-case related professional
          (non-personal) travel from their chief bankruptcy judges, and that such travel be reported annually
          to Congress by the Director of the Administrative Office. It was the Committee's view, shared by
          the Bankruptcy Committee, that although Congress has a legitimate interest in how the judiciary
          spends appropriated funds, the provision would impose unjustifiable administrative burdens and
          unnecessarily require advance clearance for travel plainly appropriate in purpose and scope. On
          recommendation of the Judicial Branch Committee, the Conference agreed to (a) affirm the
          importance of travel undertaken for governance and educational purposes in achieving judiciary and
          public policy objectives; and (b) reaffirm strongly the judiciary's obligation, responsibility, and
          authority to regulate judicial travel, and oppose specific legislative regulation of such travel. The
          Judicial Conference declined to adopt a third Committee proposal that judges be required to report
          non-case related official travel to the appropriate chief judge.

     COMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES

          __________________
          ARTICLE III JUDGESHIP NEEDS

                Courts of Appeals. In March 1997, the Judicial Conference voted to recommend an
          additional judgeship for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (JCUS-MAR 97, pp. 26-27). At the
          request of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and on recommendation of the Committee on Judicial
          Resources, the Judicial Conference agreed at this session to rescind its recommendation for the
          additional Fifth Circuit judgeship.

                 Court of Appeals Judgeship Survey. In response to congressional interest in the judiciary's
          developing an internal mechanism for recommending that judgeship vacancies not be filled, the
          Judicial Conference, in March 1997, approved a process for reviewing workload situations in the
          district courts that may suggest the need to recommend not filling a vacant judgeship or eliminating
          a judgeship (JCUS-MAR 97, p. 27). After opportunity for comment by circuit judicial councils, the
          Committee on Judicial Resources proposed a similar mechanism for the courts of appeals. The
          Judicial Conference approved the process to be included in the biennial judgeship surveys for
          determining when to recommend that a vacancy not be filled or a position be eliminated in the
          courts of appeals beginning with the next survey. Since the United States Courts of Appeals for the


RPJC Mar 1998                                                                                    Page 13 of 22
          District of Columbia and the Federal Circuits are currently excluded from the process and standards
          used by the Conference for determining judgeship needs, those courts would be excluded also from
          this process.

                 District Courts. In March 1996, the Judicial Conference recommended conversion of an
          existing temporary judgeship in the Northern District of Alabama to a permanent position (JCUS-
          MAR 96, p. 24). The temporary judgeship in that district lapsed in May 1996, and the district was
          not included for a judgeship in the temporary judgeship bill which was approved by Congress in
          October 1997 (Pub. L. No. 105-53). Since the need for an additional judge remains, the Judicial
          Conference approved a Judicial Resources Committee recommendation to amend its judgeship
          request to Congress to include one additional permanent judgeship for the Northern District of
          Alabama.

                 The Judicial Conference, in September 1996, recommended one additional temporary
          judgeship for the Middle District of Louisiana (JCUS-SEP 96, pp. 59-60). However, the district's
          need for an additional judge was satisfied with the enactment of Public Law No. 105-53, which
          transferred one permanent judgeship from the Eastern District of Louisiana to the Middle District.
          With the concurrence of the chief judge of the Middle District of Louisiana, the Judicial Resources
          Committee recommended, and the Judicial Conference agreed, to amend its judgeship request to
          exclude the additional temporary judgeship for the Middle District of Louisiana.

          _________________________
          ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

                 The Judicial Resources Committee had been directed by the Judicial Conference to "consider
          the development of a funding mechanism for addressing alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
          staffing resources in the courts and report back to the Judicial Conference" (JCUS-MAR 97, p. 16).
          Using the results of a survey of all district courts, the Committee developed a staffing factor for the
          ADR programs in most district courts and a separate staffing factor for six districts with extensive
          ADR programs. On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference approved a staffing
          factor of 2.17 hours for each case participating in a local ADR program. This factor will be applied
          to most district courts beginning in fiscal year 1999 meeting the following criteria:

          a. The district court must have an established ADR program that is certified by the chief judge
          (excluding Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16 judicial settlement conferences);

          b. District clerk's office resources must be used to administer the program;

          c. The ADR program has to have been in place long enough for the district court or the
          Administrative Office to accumulate one year's worth of data; and

          d. The ADR program must be effective.

                For the following six districts, which have extensive ADR programs, the Judicial Conference
          approved a staffing factor of 4.38 hours per case in an ADR program, plus a constant of 1397.23
          hours, to be applied beginning in fiscal year 1999: Northern District of California, Middle District of
          Florida, Western District of Missouri, District of New Jersey, Eastern District of New York, and
          Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

                 In order to allow courts an additional six months for an orderly transition of functions and to
          prepare for any loss of resources associated with the sunset of the Civil Justice Reform Act or the
          redistribution of arbitration funds, the Judicial Conference approved a Judicial Resources
          Committee recommendation that funding for CJRA staffing resources in district courts be continued


RPJC Mar 1998                                                                                      Page 14 of 22

          COURTROOM SUPPORT FOR DISTRICT JUDGES

                When an active district judge resigns, retires, or dies, staffing credit and the associated
          funding for courtroom support are eliminated in the following fiscal year's allocation, unless the
          judicial vacancy is filled. However, the caseload continues to exist and requires management. On
          recommendation of the Judicial Resources Committee, the Judicial Conference authorized the
          provision of courtroom deputy clerk staffing credit and associated funding based on judicial
          vacancies when an active district judge leaves the court without taking senior status.

          _____________________________
          SALARY MATCHING/ADVANCED IN-STEP APPOINTMENT

                 The Judicial Conference approved a recommendation of the Judicial Resources Committee to
          amend the salary matching/advanced in-step appointment policy to allow setting the starting salary
          of a newly hired Court Personnel System employee at any step of the classification level, in any
          situation where an applicant has unusually high or unique qualifications directly pertinent to the
          position being filled and/or because of a special need of the court unit for the applicant's services.
          The change allows courts the option of negotiating starting salaries for new employees and enables
          court units to compete favorably with the executive branch.

          __________________
          CIRCUIT EXECUTIVES OFFICES

                 In September 1991, the Judicial Conference established a staffing methodology and staffing
          ceilings for circuit executives' offices (JCUS-SEP 91, p. 63). To update the formula and adjust for
          an error in the original study methodology, the Judicial Conference, on recommendation of the
          Judicial Resources Committee, approved revised staffing ceilings for circuit executives' offices,
          increasing the authorized staffing levels from 221.5 to 240.2 for fiscal year 2000. In addition, the
          Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative Office to approve new work units within
          these revised ceilings, beginning in fiscal year 2000, based on a demonstration of need and the
          availability of funding.

          SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS

                 The basic federal benefits package available to most judiciary employees provides retirement
          coverage, health and life insurance, and a tax-deferred savings opportunity under the Thrift Savings
          Plan. However, with specific legislative authority, non-salary benefits are offered by several federal
          agencies to their employees in addition to the base federal benefits package. In order to continue to
          attract and retain a competent workforce, the Judicial Conference agreed with a proposal of the
          Judicial Resources Committee that it seek legislation to provide the Director of the Administrative
          Office the discretion to establish a program of supplemental benefits for judicial officers and
          employees.

          _________________
          LIABILITY INSURANCE

                Public Law No. 104-201 authorizes both executive and legislative branch agencies to
          reimburse qualified employees for some of the costs incurred for professional liability insurance.
          This provision does not apply to the judiciary. On recommendation of the Committee on Judicial


RPJC Mar 1998                                                                                     Page 15 of 22
          Resources, the Judicial Conference agreed to seek an amendment to include coverage of the judicial
          branch in section 636 of Public Law No. 104-201, which authorizes reimbursement of any qualified
          employee for not to exceed one-half the costs incurred by such employee for professional liability
          insurance.

          PERSONAL ASSISTANTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES

                 In keeping with its commitment to the principles of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the
          Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the judiciary has sought to provide reasonable
          accommodations for its judicial officers and employees with disabilities, including providing
          equipment and devices that will allow members of the court family to perform job tasks, as well as
          funds to provide personal assistants for those involved in training, when necessary. However, the
          judiciary lacks explicit authority to use appropriated funds to hire personal assistants for judicial
          officers and employees with disabilities (e.g., readers for the blind and interpreters for the deaf) to
          assist in day-to-day work. The Judicial Conference approved a Judicial Resources Committee
          recommendation that it seek legislation to include the judiciary in 5 U.S.C. ยง 3102 so as to give the
          judiciary explicit authority, comparable to the executive branch, to hire personal assistants for
          employees with disabilities.

          DEPENDENT CARE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

                 A dependent care assistance program (DCAP) allows an employer to provide dependent care
          benefits to its employees tax-free, subject to certain limits. In response to a request from Congress
          for comment on pending legislation establishing a DCAP for all federal employees, the Judicial
          Conference, on recommendation of the Judicial Resources Committee, agreed to support the
          establishment of dependent care assistance programs for federal employees as provided in H.R.
          2213 (105th Congress), but with the modification that the Director of the Administrative Office be
          given the authority to establish a dependent care assistance program for the Third Branch.

          AUTHORITY TO GRANT A CONTINUANCE OF A
          PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION

                 In 1997, at the request of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, the Committee
          on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System considered a proposal to seek legislation to
          amend 18 U.S.C. ยง 3060(c) to give magistrate judges the authority to grant a continuance of a
          preliminary examination without the defendant's consent, and determined to endorse the proposal.
          Subsequently, the Rules Committee decided it would be more appropriate to propose an amendment
          to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(c) and advise Congress of the need for a parallel statutory
          change later in the rulemaking process. The matter was referred to the Advisory Committee on
          Criminal Rules, which elected to take no action on the matter. In light of the Rules Committee's
          determination not to pursue the matter, the Magistrate Judges Committee again considered the issue
          and recommended that the Judicial Conference endorse an amendment to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3060. The
          Judicial Conference determined to refer to both the Magistrate Judges Committee and the
          Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure the issue of giving magistrate judges the authority to
          grant a continuance of a preliminary examination without the consent of the accused, with
          instructions to the Rules Committee to propose an amendment to Criminal Rule 5(c) consistent with
          the legislative amendment to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3060 which has been proposed by the Magistrate Judges

                The temporary assignment of magistrate judges to other districts in emergency situations is
          permitted under 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(f). After opportunity for comment by the circuit judicial councils
          and on recommendation of the Magistrate Judges Committee, the Judicial Conference approved
          proposed Judicial Conference Guidelines for the Intercircuit and Intracircuit Assignment of United
          States Magistrate Judges for the temporary assignment of magistrate judges to other districts in
          emergency situations under 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(f).

          _____________________________
          AD HOC RECALL OF MAGISTRATE JUDGES

                 On recommendation of the Magistrate Judges Committee, the Judicial Conference approved
          two amendments to the Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United States Establishing
          Standards and Procedures for the Recall of United States Magistrate Judges. The first establishes
          workload standards for magistrate judges retired at less than full salary who are recalled to serve on
          a full-time basis, to ensure that the level of work provided is commensurate with the amount of
          recall compensation received. The second sets a cap (equal to the amount of compensation earned
          by an active part-time magistrate judge at the highest salary level (Level 1)) on the amount of annual
          salary that a retired magistrate judge may receive when recalled on a "when-actually-employed"
          basis.

          _____________________________________
          MAGISTRATE JUDGES' RETIREMENT REGULATIONS

                  As with the Bankruptcy Committee (see infra, "Bankruptcy Judges' Retirement Regulations,"
          p. 8), the Magistrate Judges Committee also recommended amendments to sections 6.03 and 12.02
          of the Regulations of the Director Implementing the Retirement and Survivors' Annuities for
          Bankruptcy Judges and Magistrates Act of 1988. The amendments, which were approved by the
          Conference, will conform the guidelines to recent statutory amendments.

          CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE JUDGE POSITIONS

                 After consideration of the report of the Magistrate Judges Committee and the
          recommendations of the Director of the Administrative Office, the district courts, and the judicial
          councils of the circuits, the Judicial Conference approved the following changes in positions,
          salaries, and arrangements for full-time and part-time magistrate judge positions. Changes with a
          budgetary impact are to be effective when appropriated funds are available.

     ORDERS

          _________________
          COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                The Committee reported on pending legislation, H.R. 1252 (105th Congress), which would
          amend the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980, 28 U.S.C. ยง 372(c), to provide that any
          complaint of judicial misconduct or disability filed under the Act that is not dismissed at the outset
          by the chief judge of the circuit in which the complained-against judge serves shall be transferred to
          another circuit for further complaint proceedings. The provision has been amended since the
          Judicial Conference opposed it in April 1997 (JCUS-SEP 97, pp. 81-82). The Committee advised


RPJC Mar 1998                                                                                     Page 19 of 22
          that no new Judicial Conference action was necessary, but that it would continue to monitor the
          legislation.

     COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE

          _____________
          SIZE OF GRAND JURY

                 H.R. 1536 (105th Congress) would reduce the size of a grand jury to not less than nine, nor
          more than thirteen persons and would require at least seven jurors to concur in an indictment so long
          as nine members were present. In 1975, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules favored similar
          legislation. However, the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, agreeing with the present
          position of its Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules, recommended that the Judicial Conference
          oppose H.R. 1536 for three reasons: a reduced grand jury would increase the possibility of a
          runaway prosecution, have less diversity of viewpoints and experiences, and cause diminished
          citizen participation. The Judicial Conference agreed to oppose the legislation.

     COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND FACILITIES

          _______________________
          FIVE-YEAR COURTHOUSE PROJECT PLAN

                 At its March 1997 session, the Judicial Conference approved a five-year plan of courthouse
          projects arrayed in priority order for fiscal years 1998-2002 (JCUS-MAR 97, p. 39). Because the
          President's fiscal year 1998 budget did not include any funding for courthouse construction projects,
          all projects in the 1998-2002 plan have been delayed at least one year. After consultation with the
          chief circuit judges and circuit executives, the Committee on Security and Facilities proposed a five-
          year courthouse construction plan for the fiscal years 1999-2003, which the Judicial Conference
          endorsed. The Conference also voted to delegate to the Security and Facilities Committee the
          authority to move projects not included in the President's fiscal year 1999 budget request, but shown
          in the fiscal year 1999 column of the plan, to fiscal year 2000.

          ___________________________
          GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION IMPROVEMENT ACT

                 A proposed bill, the General Services Administration Improvement Act of 1997, H.R. 2751
          (105th Congress), would, among other things, require submission to Congress of courtroom
          utilization data for existing and proposed new courthouses, information on courtroom sharing, and
          conformance with standards of the United States Courts Design Guide. The bill would also require
          comment and transmittal of the Design Guide by GSA to Congress on an annual basis. Noting that
          the bill was unnecessary in light of existing judiciary initiatives and that it is inappropriate to
          legislate administrative prerequisites in the area of federal real estate, the Security and Facilities
          Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference oppose those provisions of H.R. 2751 that
          affect the judiciary. The Conference concurred in the Committee's recommendation.

          ________________
          FUNDS FOR NEW BUILDINGS

                 Funds borrowed by the government to finance the construction of buildings are accounted for
          in the federal budget as if they are spent in one to three years, even though, as in a mortgage, the
          funds plus interest might be paid to the entity from which they were borrowed over a 20- or 30-year
          period. H.R. 623 (105th Congress) would change the way these transactions are accounted for in the
          federal budget. The change would result in a more realistic and favorable treatment of capital

          investments in the federal budget to the benefit of the judiciary. On recommendation of the Security
          and Facilities Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to endorse H.R. 623 with respect to
          financing mechanisms for public buildings.

     AD HOC COMMITTEE TO STUDY MERITS OF
     MOTIONS RELATED TO THE REPORT OF THE
     AD HOC STRATEGIC PLANNING COMMITTEE
     OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER

          ______________________
          ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE/FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER
          RELATIONS

                In 1996, the Chief Justice appointed an Ad Hoc Strategic Planning Committee of the Federal
          Judicial Center to review and to make recommendations concerning the operations of the Federal
          Judicial Center in relation to its statutory missions. The Committee's report, approved by the FJC
          Board in June 1997, included several recommendations concerning the relationship between the
          Administrative Office and the Federal Judicial Center. The FJC Director's proposals (referred to as
          Motions A and B) for implementation of these recommendations were submitted to the Executive
          Committee, and in September 1997, the Judicial Conference authorized the creation of an ad hoc
          committee, consisting of members of the Conference, to study the merits of the two motions (JCUS-
          SEP 97, p. 47).

                After hearing from both the Administrative Office and the Federal Judicial Center, as well as
          from a number of chairs of Judicial Conference committees, the Conference's Ad Hoc Committee
          revised the two motions and recommended their endorsement by the Judicial Conference. The
          Conference unanimously adopted the recommendations which follow. With regard to the four-
          person Judicial Conference/Federal Judicial Center Working Group described below, the
          Conference anticipates that in actual practice, the Working Group will function rarely, if ever, and
          any decisions it does make will result in accommodations that are acceptable to both directors.

                The Judicial Conference agrees that:

                a. The Federal Judicial Center (FJC) is the federal courts' primary educational agency, but the
                Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO) nonetheless remains in control of its
                own educational programs. Under existing law, Conference policy, and established practice,

                      1. the FJC is responsible generally for judicial training, case and court management
                      training, and professional management education and training of supervisory and
                      professional personnel; and

                      2. the AO is responsible generally for education and training related to the proper
                      performance of the administrative and operational duties vested in the Director of the
                      AO by statute, and delegated by him to court personnel.

                b. The Interagency Coordinating Committee of Senior Managers referred to in the report of
                the 1990 AO/FJC Task Force shall be reinstituted. Composed of an equal number of AO and
                FJC personnel and co-chaired by the designees of the AO and FJC Directors, this Committee
                shall meet regularly and institute procedures to ensure that the 1993 interagency agreement
                and this declaration of policy are implemented. In particular, the Committee shall perform the
                following functions:

                      1. assess the future education and training needs of the third branch;

                        2. collaborate in the planning and formulation of specific training programs to meet
                        unsatisfied needs and respond to Conference committee requests in regard to education;

                        3. review periodically both existing as well as contemplated agency educational
                        offerings, with each agency exchanging with the other in a timely fashion information
                        concerning the design, substance, methodology, and faculty of these programs and
                        whether an outside contractor or vendor has been or should be used;

                        4. reduce any overlap in educational programs offered by the agencies and avoid even
                        the appearance of duplication;

                        5. coordinate with relevant committees of the Judicial Conference; and

                        6. establish as necessary protocols to govern interagency relations in the field of
                        education and training.

                  The Judicial Conference approves the creation of a four-person Judicial Conference/Federal
                  Judicial Center Working Group consisting of one member of the Conference and one member
                  of the FJC Board (each to be designated by the Chief Justice), together with the Directors of
                  the AO and the FJC, or their designees, to resolve interagency disputes between the FJC and
                  the AO concerning education and training issues that cannot be resolved on the staff level. If
                  the group cannot resolve an interagency dispute, it shall submit it to the Chief Justice for
                  resolution or referral to the appropriate body. The Chief Justice shall have the discretion to
                  dissolve the Working Group at any time he concludes that such action is in the best interests
                  of the federal judiciary.


      FUNDING

                  All of the foregoing recommendations which require the expenditure of funds for
            implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to the availability of funds, and
            subject to whatever priorities the Conference might establish for the use of available resources.

      RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION

                  Except as otherwise specified, the Conference authorized the immediate release of matters
            considered by this session where necessary for legislative or administrative action.




                                                                     Chief Justice of the United States
