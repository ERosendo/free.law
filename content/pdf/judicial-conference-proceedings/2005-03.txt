                                       HONORABLE JOHN G. HEYBURN II

                              Chair of the Budget Committee from 1994 to 2004. Appointed
                              to the Committee by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in

                                                                    March 15, 2005

       of skilled leadership and earned our deep respect and sincere
       gratitude for his innumerable contributions. We acknowledge
       with appreciation his commitment and dedicated service to the
       Judicial Conference and to the entire federal judiciary.


CIRCUIT JUDICIAL CONFERENCES

        Under 28 U.S.C. § 333, “[t]he chief judge of each circuit may summon
biennially, and may summon annually, the circuit, district, and bankruptcy
judges of the circuit, in active service, to a conference at a time and place that
he designates, for the purpose of considering the business of the courts and
advising means of improving the administration of justice within such circuit.”
Nearly all circuits convene annual or biennial conferences, sometimes with
members of the bar and sometimes without. Circuits are provided allotments
from centrally held appropriated funds for conference expenses (other than
judges’ travel expenses, which are paid from a separate centrally held fund),
but some circuits pay for certain expenses with non-appropriated funds, such as
conference registration fees and attorney admission fees. In an effort to
contain costs, the Judicial Conference adopted an Executive Committee
recommendation that insofar as funding of such conferences is concerned, the
Conference (a) encourage the circuits to look to alternative funding sources for
non-travel-related expenses to the extent advisable and permissible, including
non-appropriated funds (such as attorney admission fees if the bar participates
in a conference) and (b) authorize use of appropriated funds for non-travel-
related expenses only in alternate years. This action does not apply to circuit
judicial conferences for which binding commitments have already been made.


FEDERAL COURTS IMPROVEMENT BILL

         Every two years, each Conference committee considers legislative
initiatives within its jurisdiction that were approved by the Conference but not
yet enacted to decide whether those provisions should be pursued in the
upcoming federal courts improvement bill or another legislative vehicle, and
notifies the Executive Committee of its determinations. The Executive
Committee reviewed the decisions of the committees on whether pending
Conference positions should be pursued in the 109th Congress and concurred in
the determinations of the committees, with one exception. The exception,
dealing with judges carrying firearms, was due to intervening circumstances,
and the Security and Facilities Committee concurred with the Executive
Committee’s determination (see infra, “Security Issues,” pp. 6-7). The

                                        5
Judicial Conference of the United States

                     Executive Committee also reviewed legislative provisions within its own
                     jurisdiction that had not yet been enacted.


                     SECURITY ISSUES

                             In response to recent violence against judges and their families and
                     staff and on recommendation of the Executive Committee, the Judicial
                     Conference adopted the following resolution, which was introduced as new
                     business on the Conference floor:

                                          The brutal murders of the husband and mother of
                              United States Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow of the Northern
                              District of Illinois on February 28, 2005, are an attack against
                              the rule of law in the United States. This tragedy suffered by a
                              member of our judicial family, as well as the horrific events that
                              occurred on March 11, 2005, in the courthouse in Fulton
                              County, Georgia, strike at the core of our system of government.
                              A fair and impartial judiciary is the backbone of a democracy.
                              These tragic events cannot and will not undermine the
                              judiciary's essential role in our society.

                                          We, the members of the Judicial Conference, call
                              upon leaders of the United States Department of Justice and of
                              the United States Marshals Service (whose primary
                              responsibility is the security of members of the federal judiciary
                              and their families) to review fully and expeditiously all aspects
                              of judicial security and, in particular, security at judges' homes
                              and other locations away from the courthouse. We also call
                              upon both the legislative and executive branches to provide
                              adequate funding for this essential function.

                                          Accordingly, the Judicial Conference of the United
                              States declares that (1) the crisis in off-site judicial security
                              evidenced in part by the recent deaths of Judge Lefkow's
                              husband and mother is of the gravest concern to the federal
                              judiciary, and (2) addressing this matter is of the highest
                              urgency to the Conference and will be the top priority in the
                              judiciary's discussions with the Attorney General of the United
                              States and other Justice Department representatives, including
                              the Director of the United States Marshals Service.

        The Executive Committee took the following additional steps to
enhance judicial security. It directed the Administrative Office to work with
commercial information providers, such as computer-assisted legal research
firms and credit bureaus, to block unjustified access to personal information of
judges and their families. It directed the Committee on Security and Facilities
and other relevant Conference committees and the Administrative Office to
conduct a comprehensive review of the judiciary’s security requirements to
determine what further actions are needed to improve off-site judicial security,
and it asked the Security and Facilities Committee to continue its efforts to
work with the United States Marshals Service on this issue. In addition, it
revisited whether the judiciary should pursue a longstanding Conference-
approved proposal to authorize federal judges to carry firearms in certain
circumstances and establish a firearms training program for judges (JCUS-SEP
90, p. 69) and concluded that, in light of current circumstances, the proposal
should be pursued in the 109th Congress (see supra, “Federal Courts
Improvement Bill,” pp. 5-6).

Judicial Conference of the United States

                     •         Determined to defer, until the September 2005 session of the Judicial
                               Conference, implementation of an increase in the bankruptcy adversary
                               proceeding filing fee that occurred when an increase in the civil action
                               filing fee, to which the adversary proceeding fee is linked, was
                               authorized by Congress in the omnibus appropriations act;

                     •         On recommendation of the Rules Committee, approved the withdrawal
                               of a proposed amendment to Criminal Rule 32 (see JCUS-SEP 04,
                               p. 33), prior to its transmittal to the Supreme Court, that addresses a
                               victim’s right to allocution in the district court, to avoid conflict with
                               the recently enacted Justice for All Act of 2004, Public Law No.
                               108-405, which also addresses a victim’s right to be heard at public
                               proceedings in the district courts;

                     •         Allowed to take effect the annual automatic adjustment to the
                               alternative subsistence rate for judges’ travel expenses; and

                     •         Made referrals to appropriate Conference committees as follows: asked
                               the Judicial Resources Committee to review its standards for
                               recommending new Article III judgeships; asked the Court
                               Administration and Case Management and the Judicial Resources
                               Committees to make recommendations to the September 2005 Judicial
                               Conference on whether the Judicial Conference should take a position
                               regarding the proposed split of the Ninth Circuit, and if so, what
                               considerations should inform that position; asked the Magistrate Judges
                               Committee to update its earlier report on the growth of the magistrate
                               judges system and forward it to the Judicial Resources Committee; and
                               asked the Budget Committee to provide advice on a recommendation of
                               the Security and Facilities Committee regarding the courthouse
                               construction project plan for FY 2007 from the perspective of the
                               judiciary’s overall budget and to consider and make recommendations
                               to the Security and Facilities Committee and the Executive Committee
                               regarding affordability of pending courthouse construction projects not
                               already approved for construction by the Judicial Conference.


             COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
                         COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that it undertook
                         a comprehensive review of the statutory duties, organization, resources, and

                                                                8
                                                                        March 15, 2005

       activities of the various components of the Administrative Office, with
       primary emphasis on budget restrictions and cost-containment initiatives
       within the Administrative Office and judiciary wide. Noting that AO staffing
       has not grown in ten years, the Committee observed that the AO has
       continued to provide a wide range of essential services and quality support to
       the Judicial Conference and its committees and to the courts despite resource
       shortages. The Committee expressed its satisfaction with the efficient
       manner in which the AO manages its limited resources and other funds on
       behalf of the courts, and it concluded that the AO does everything within its
       capability to expend resources economically.


COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

      ADDITIONAL BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIPS

               Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 152(b)(2), the Judicial Conference submits
      periodic recommendations for new bankruptcy judgeships to Congress, which
      establishes the number of such judgeships for each judicial district. In March
      1991, the Conference adopted a policy that provides for a national survey of
      judgeship needs every two years and establishes criteria for evaluating requests
      for additional bankruptcy judgeships (JCUS-MAR 91, pp. 12-13). Based on
      the 2004-2005 biennial survey of judgeship needs, the Committee
      recommended that the Judicial Conference transmit to Congress proposed
      legislation to create 47 additional bankruptcy judgeship positions, convert
      three existing temporary bankruptcy judgeship positions to permanent status,
      extend for an additional five-year period the temporary bankruptcy judgeship
      in one district, and convert the bankruptcy judgeship shared by two districts to
      a full-time position for one of them. The Committee asked the Judicial
      Conference to approve the request on an expedited basis so that the most up-to-
      date recommendation could be included in bankruptcy legislation (S. 256, 109th
      Congress) that was moving quickly in Congress. Congress has not approved
      new bankruptcy judgeships since 1992, although bankruptcy filings and
      judicial workloads have risen dramatically in that period. By mail ballot
      concluded on February 16, 2005, the Conference approved the Committee’s
      recommendation.1

 The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Public
Law No. 109-8, was signed into law on April 20, 2005. It did not include the updated
recommendation for new judgeships.

Judicial Conference of the United States



                     OFFICIAL DUTY STATION

                             On the recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee, and in
                     accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 152(b)(1), the Judicial Conference approved a
                     request of the Eleventh Circuit Judicial Council to transfer the official duty
                     station of Bankruptcy Judge Paul G. Hyman, Jr., from Fort Lauderdale to West
                     Palm Beach in the Southern District of Florida.


                     COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                             The Bankruptcy Committee reported that it devoted most of its meeting
                     to discussing how best to further the judiciary’s cost-containment effort and
                     develop innovative ways for bankruptcy courts to work even more efficiently
                     and economically in the future. The Committee also endorsed two suggestions
                     to educate judges on the subject of attorney discipline in bankruptcy courts;
                     reviewed all pending Conference-approved legislative positions within its
                     jurisdiction at the request of the Executive Committee; endorsed a
                     recommendation that the Federal Judicial Center develop and maintain an on-
                     line judicial performance survey for use by bankruptcy judges, subject to
                     certain conditions; and received reports on a wide range of topics.


             COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on the Budget reported that it expects the judiciary’s
                      budget outlook to continue to be challenging for the next several years due to
                      fiscal constraints faced by Congress. Much of the Committee’s discussions
                      focused on developing strategies for obtaining from Congress the funding
                      necessary for the judiciary to do its work. To that end, the Budget Committee
                      established a Congressional Outreach Subcommittee to focus and coordinate
                      all of the judiciary’s efforts to acquire additional resources. The Committee
                      also expressed its support of the efforts of the program committees in
                      implementing the cost-containment strategy that was approved by the Judicial
                      Conference in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 5-7). Finally, the
                      Committee adopted a resolution re-affirming its support for the budget
                      decentralization program in these uncertain budgetary times.

COMMITTEE ON CODES OF CONDUCT
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that since its last report
    to the Conference in September 2004, the Committee received 29 new written
    inquiries and issued 28 written advisory responses (one inquiry was
    withdrawn). During this period, the average response time for requests was
    15 days. The Chairman received and responded to 19 oral inquiries, and the
    other Committee members responded individually to 159 oral inquiries from
    their colleagues.


COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
AND CASE MANAGEMENT

    REFUNDING FEES PAID ELECTRONICALLY

             The Judicial Conference has a longstanding policy prohibiting the
    refund of fees, with narrow exceptions, e.g., when fees are collected without
    authority or as a result of administrative error on the part of the clerk’s office.
    However, the introduction of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files
    (CM/ECF) system, which allows parties to pay fees electronically with a
    credit card, has created many more opportunities for error on the part of filers.
    On recommendation of the Committee on Court Administration and Case
    Management, the Judicial Conference approved, in principle, guidance for the
    courts regarding the refunding of fees paid electronically. The guidance
    provides, among other things, that courts should develop procedures for
    addressing refunds of electronic payments, that refunds should be requested
    by motion or application, that the decision whether to refund is a judicial
    determination, but may be delegated to the clerk as long as procedures clearly
    address the types of refunds clerks may authorize, and that refunds should be
    processed electronically, not through checks.


    DISPOSAL OF SCANNED RECORDS

           On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
    endorsed a proposed agreement between the National Archives and Records
    Administration (NARA) and the Administrative Office that paper case files in
    bankruptcy and district courts utilizing the national CM/ECF system need not

                                            11
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      be retained for archival purposes after they have been scanned in their entirety
                      into the CM/ECF system. The agreement, along with a proposed disposition
                      schedule, will be transmitted to NARA for its formal clearance process.


                      DIGITAL AUDIO COURT RECORDING

                              In September 1999, the Judicial Conference approved the use of digital
                      audio recording equipment as an additional method of taking the official
                      record of court proceedings with a funding limitation that any additional costs
                      for such equipment over the cost of analog equipment would be defrayed from
                      decentralized funds (JCUS-SEP 99, p. 56). In the intervening years, the cost
                      of digital audio equipment has become more competitive, the technology has
                      improved, and analog equipment has started to become obsolete. The
                      Committee therefore recommended, and the Conference approved, removal of
                      this funding limitation for courts seeking procurement of digital audio
                      recording systems.


                      MODEL GRAND JURY CHARGE

                              At the request of the American College of Trial Lawyers, the Court
                      Administration and Case Management Committee undertook a comprehensive
                      review of the current Model Grand Jury Charge approved by the Judicial
                      Conference in March 1986 (JCUS-MAR 86, p. 33). Noting that the
                      Conference-approved charge differed from the model charge included in the
                      Benchbook for U.S. District Judges (Benchbook) published by the Federal
                      Judicial Center, the Committee worked with the Federal Judicial Center’s
                      Benchbook Committee to come up with a single revised model charge to be
                      approved by the Conference and included in the FJC’s Benchbook. After
                      obtaining input from a number of sources, including the Department of Justice
                      and the Committees on Criminal Law and Defender Services, the Committee
                      on Court Administration and Case Management recommended a revised
                      Model Grand Jury Charge for the Conference’s approval. The Conference
                      adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                      FILING FEE FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS

                             The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, Public Law No. 108-
                      447, enacted on December 8, 2004, raised the district court filing fee from
                      $150 to $250. The filing fee for the Court of Federal Claims, which the

                                                            12
                                                                        March 15, 2005

    Judicial Conference has authority to amend pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1926(a),
    has traditionally tracked the district court filing fee. On recommendation of
    the Committee, the Conference agreed to amend the fee schedule for the U.S.
    Court of Federal Claims to increase the filing fee from $150 to $250.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
    reported that it is continuing work on several cost-containment initiatives,
    such as the delivery of administrative services in the courts and cost savings
    associated with use of the CM/ECF system. The Committee is also
    reevaluating its current fee principles to ensure that they accurately reflect the
    recommendations made by the Committee and adopted by the Conference that
    have resulted in an estimated $80 million in additional annual revenue. The
    Committee reviewed all outstanding Conference-approved legislative
    provisions under its jurisdiction in order to determine if they should be
    included in the courts improvement bill or other legislative vehicles that will
    be introduced in the 109th Congress.


COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAW
    PRESENTENCE INVESTIGATION REPORT MONOGRAPH

            On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, the Judicial
    Conference approved revisions to The Presentence Investigation Report for
    Defendants Sentenced Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Publication
    107, for publication and distribution to the courts. The revisions incorporate
    program changes that implement cost-containment measures approved by the
    Judicial Conference in September 2004, including revisions to reduce the
    program requirements for presentence investigation reports and to reduce the
    circumstances in which post-conviction supervision is recommended (JCUS-
    SEP 04, pp. 14-15). Language discouraging the practice of adding conditions
    of supervision to the 13 standard conditions included in the “Judgment in a
    Criminal Case” form, as well as technical changes, was also included.

                      POST-CONVICTION SUPERVISION MONOGRAPH

                              The Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference approve
                      revisions to The Supervision of Federal Offenders, Monograph 109, for
                      publication and distribution to the courts. The revisions incorporate program
                      changes that implement cost-containment measures approved by the Judicial
                      Conference in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 14-15), as well as new
                      cost-containment measures and technical changes. The revisions are designed
                      to limit the growth in the number of offenders under post-conviction
                      supervision, reduce post-conviction supervision program requirements, and
                      contain costs in substance abuse treatment services paid for by the judiciary.
                      The Conference approved the Committee’s recommendation.


                      PRETRIAL SERVICES INVESTIGATION
                      AND REPORT MONOGRAPH

                              On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, the Judicial
                      Conference approved revisions to The Pretrial Services Investigation and
                      Report, Monograph 112, for publication and distribution to the courts. The
                      revisions included those that implement cost-containment program changes
                      approved by the Conference in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 14-15), as
                      well as new cost-containment and technical changes. The changes are
                      intended to, among other things, reduce or eliminate the practice of
                      conducting pretrial services investigations for certain cases, create new model
                      pretrial services reports, and reduce or eliminate the practice of
                      recommending pretrial services supervision in certain cases.


                      CONSOLIDATION OF PROBATION AND
                      PRETRIAL SERVICES OFFICES

                              On several occasions, the Committee on Criminal Law has considered
                      whether potential cost savings could be achieved by the consolidation of
                      probation and pretrial services offices. In September 1997, the Judicial
                      Conference affirmed the principle that the form of organization for providing
                      pretrial services should be determined by the individual district courts and
                      their respective judicial councils (JCUS-SEP 97, p. 66). The Committee was
                      again asked to consider whether savings could be achieved by consolidating
                      any remaining separate probation and pretrial services offices as part of the


                                                            14
                                                                    March 15, 2005

judiciary’s comprehensive cost-containment strategy approved by the Judicial
Conference in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 5-7). After an exhaustive
study, the Committee recommended that the Conference maintain the policy
that the form of organization for providing pretrial services should be
determined by individual district courts and their respective circuit councils,
but districts that have not considered the issue of consolidation of their
separate probation and pretrial services offices should do so when—

a.     a chief probation or pretrial services officer is scheduled to retire or
       transfer; and

b.     consolidation may serve as a means to achieve additional economies
       and efficiencies without compromising the mission of pretrial services.

The Conference approved the Committee’s recommendation.


SENTENCING ISSUES

       The Committee on Criminal Law considered, and discussed
extensively, sentencing issues in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in
the consolidated cases, United States v. Booker/United States v. Fanfan,
125 S.Ct. 738 (2005). On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
agreed to take the following actions:

a.     Resolve that the federal judiciary is committed to a sentencing
       guideline system that is fair, workable, transparent, predictable, and
       flexible;

b.     Urge Congress to take no immediate legislative action and instead to
       maintain an advisory sentencing guideline system;

c.     Delegate to the Committee on Criminal Law the authority to—

       1.      develop educational programs, forms, and other similar
               guidance for judges and probation officers;

       2.      work with the Sentencing Commission to improve the
               Statement of Reasons form and evaluate additional methods to
               ensure accurate and complete reporting of sentencing
               decisions;


                                       15
Judicial Conference of the United States

                               3.          work with the Commission to improve the Commission’s data
                                           collection, analyses, and reporting to ensure that sentencing
                                           data meet the needs of the Commission, Congress, and the
                                           judiciary; and

                               4.          develop various strategies to pursue and promote the above-
                                           described Conference positions in discussion with the
                                           Commission, Department of Justice, and Congress; and

                      d.       Oppose legislation that would respond to the Supreme Court’s
                               decision by (1) raising directly the upper limit of each guideline range
                               or (2) expanding the use of mandatory minimum sentences.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Criminal Law reported its suggestion to the
                      Judicial Resources Committee that that Committee recommend to the
                      Conference adoption of a resolution encouraging courts in a position to hire to
                      consider hiring highly qualified and well-trained probation and pretrial
                      services officers from those federal courts that are forced to make involuntary
                      reductions to staff (see infra, “Inter-District Transfer Policy,” p. 26). In
                      addition, in response to an Executive Committee request, the Committee
                      considered whether certain law enforcement responsibilities should continue
                      to reside within the judiciary. The Committee unanimously agreed that the
                      probation and pretrial services system provides valuable services to the
                      judiciary, but requested additional information that would help determine
                      whether there are compelling reasons, including significant cost savings, for
                      transferring post-conviction supervision functions to an outside agency.


             COMMITTEE ON DEFENDER SERVICES
                      COUNSEL IN CASES NO LONGER DEATH ELIGIBLE

                              Section 3005 of title 18, United States Code, entitles a defendant, upon
                      indictment for a federal death-eligible offense, to obtain the appointment of
                      two counsel, at least one of whom is learned in the law applicable to capital
                      cases. The maximum panel attorney hourly compensation rate in capital
                      cases, which is set pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 848(q)(10)(A), is significantly
                      higher than the noncapital rate, which is established under the Criminal
                      Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(d)(1). Where it is determined some time after

                                                                 16

indictment that the death penalty will not be sought, paragraph 6.02B(2) of the
Guidelines for the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA
Guidelines), Volume 7, Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, provides
that the court may reconsider whether the number of counsel initially
appointed and the higher rate of compensation initially authorized is necessary
for the duration of the proceeding. On recommendation of the Committee on
Defender Services, the Conference agreed to strengthen the language of CJA
Guideline 6.02B(2) to discourage courts, absent extenuating circumstances,
from continuing more than one counsel and/or the maximum capital
compensation rate in those cases in which it is determined that the death
penalty will not be sought. The amended guideline lists a number of factors
for the courts to consider in determining whether extenuating circumstances
exist.


REPRESENTATION OF FEDERAL JURORS

        Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1875, jurors are protected against discharge,
intimidation, or coercion by their employers as a result of being summoned
for jury service in a federal court. Any juror claiming a violation of this
provision is, upon a district court’s finding of probable merit, entitled to
appointment of counsel to represent him or her in any action in the district
court necessary to the resolution of such claim. On recommendation of the
Committee, the Judicial Conference approved revisions to paragraphs
2.01E(4) and 2.22B(2) of the CJA Guidelines to clarify that appointments to
represent federal jurors for the protection of their employment are
compensable with Defender Services funds, that private attorneys (rather than
federal defenders) should receive such appointments, and that the Criminal
Justice Act’s felony case compensation maximum applies to such
representations.


COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEGAL RESEARCH

       In March 2003, the Judicial Conference approved a pilot program in
which up to six courts were authorized to utilize simplified and expedited
procedures for reimbursing CJA panel attorneys for expenses incurred in
conducting computer-assisted legal research (JCUS-MAR 03, pp. 12-13). The
purpose of the pilot was to assess the budgetary impact of the proposed new
procedures. On recommendation of the Committee, which found minimal
budgetary impact, the Judicial Conference terminated the pilot program and
approved revisions to paragraphs 2.27, 2.31, and 3.15 of the CJA Guidelines,

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Defender Services reported that it approved project
                      plans for four major Defender Services cost-containment initiatives. To
                      advance its goal of limiting costs of CJA representations in capital cases and
                      large, non-capital “mega-cases,” the Committee approved a proposal to
                      request an Administrative Office reimbursable position to provide objective
                      case-budgeting advice for judges. The Committee also authorized one capital
                      § 2255 counsel position, in view of the growing need for qualified and cost-
                      effective representation in post-conviction federal death penalty cases;
                      funding for a mitigation coordinator, in light of increased demand for capital
                      mitigation expertise following the Supreme Court’s decision in Wiggins v.
                      Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003); and establishment of two federal defender
                      sentencing counsel positions, needed to address the obligation of federal
                      defenders to provide comments to the United States Sentencing Commission
                      pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(o). In addition, under its delegated authority
                      from the Judicial Conference (JCUS-MAR 89, pp. 16-17), the Committee
                      approved (subject to the availability of funds and authorization by Congress)
                      FY 2005 funding totaling $644,900 for federal defender offices to serve three
                      new districts.


             COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL-STATE JURISDICTION
                      SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY CLAIMS PROCESS

                              The Social Security Administration (SSA) has indicated an intent to
                      propose regulations that would eliminate a claimant’s right to request review
                      by the SSA’s Appeals Council of an adverse decision of an administrative law
                      judge (ALJ). The Appeals Council would be abolished and the ALJ’s
                      decision would become the agency’s final decision, unless it was chosen for a
                      further discretionary review. The Federal-State Jurisdiction Committee was
                      concerned that the proposed changes would significantly increase the number
                      of Social Security cases filed in federal court, and also had the potential for
                      increasing costs and delays for dissatisfied claimants. On recommendation of
                      the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to support efforts to improve
                      the efficiency and effectiveness of the process by which the Social Security
                      Administration considers Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security

    Income claims, but oppose the elimination of a claimant’s right to request
    review of an administrative law judge’s adverse decision by the Appeals
    Council, or another administrative reviewing unit with comparable authority,
    prior to seeking relief in federal district court.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction reported that it is
    considering two proposals to clarify the treatment of stipulations as to the
    amount in controversy in diversity of citizenship actions when such actions
    are removed to federal court, as well as several proposals for amendments to
    the venue statute. The Committee also discussed a number of other legislative
    issues, including bills that seek to eliminate the jurisdiction of the federal
    courts to decide constitutional challenges related to certain issues and the
    jurisdictional provisions in a draft asbestos bill. In addition, the Committee
    reviewed outstanding Conference-approved legislative positions within its
    jurisdiction to determine whether they should be pursued in the 109th
    Congress. The Committee received a report on the work of the Pacific Islands
    Committee of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council and heard a presentation on
    the concept of federalism.


COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Financial Disclosure reported that as of
    December 31, 2004, the Committee had received 3,942 financial disclosure
    reports and certifications for the calendar year 2003, including 1,314 reports
    and certifications from Supreme Court justices, Article III judges, and judicial
    officers of special courts; 353 from bankruptcy judges; 553 from magistrate
    judges; and 1,722 from judicial employees. The Committee also reported that
    it continues to pursue amendment of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to
    change the reporting requirements for judicial officers and employees and
    ensure continuation of the redaction authority that has been granted to the
    judiciary, but is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005.

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Information Technology reported that it discussed a
                      general approach to identifying and implementing more cost-effective service
                      delivery models, and that it is refining the content and purposes of information
                      technology training, especially that pertaining to judges. With respect to
                      privacy and security of the judiciary’s data communications network, the
                      Committee will prepare an overall strategy and provide ample opportunity for
                      comment in advance of making future policy recommendations. The
                      Committee resolved that courts should use non-appropriated funds to provide
                      public access to the Internet and encouraged courts to share non-appropriated
                      funds among all court units within the district for that purpose. The
                      Committee also received updates on various initiatives, including the Edwin

                              The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that during the
                      period from July 1, 2004, to December 31, 2004, a total of 92 intercircuit
                      assignments, undertaken by 57 Article III judges, were processed and
                      recommended by the Committee on Intercircuit Assignments and approved by
                      the Chief Justice. During calendar year 2004, a total of 148 intercircuit
                      assignments were processed and approved. In addition, the Committee aided
                      courts requesting assistance by both identifying and obtaining judges willing
                      to take assignments. The Committee also reported that it was updated on the
                      Administrative Office’s efforts to collect data on visiting judges and
                      accompanying chambers staff for the purpose of evaluating the costs and

COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL RELATIONS
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

             The Committee on International Judicial Relations reported on its
    involvement in rule of law and judicial reform activities throughout the
    world, highlighting those in Croatia, Slovenia, Ecuador, Liberia, Mexico, and
    the Russian Federation. The Committee will be working closely with the U.S.
    Agency for International Development and its contractor in Mexico over the
    next five years to support that country's judicial reform and rule-of-law
    efforts.


COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
    “FEGLI FIX”

             Retired Article III Judges. Pursuant to Public Law No. 106-113, in
    September 2000, the Judicial Conference authorized the Director of the
    Administrative Office to pay any increases in the cost of Federal Employees'
    Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) imposed after April 24, 1999, including any
    expenses generated by such payments, to all active Article III judges aged 65
    and above, senior judges retired under 28 U.S.C. § 371(b) or § 372(a), and
    judges retired under 28 U.S.C. § 371(a) who were enrolled in the program
    (JCUS-SEP 00, pp. 54-55). The purpose of the “FEGLI fix” was to maintain
    stability in FEGLI premium payments of Article III judges (many of whom
    had come to rely on FEGLI benefits as the centerpiece of their estate plans) in
    the face of substantial Office of Personnel Management rate increases. At this
    session, the Committee on the Judicial Branch recommended that the Judicial
    Conference amend its policy prospectively to exclude payments on behalf of
    judicial officers who retire from office under 28 U.S.C. § 371(a), noting that
    such payments could serve as an incentive for Article III judges to retire from
    the judicial office. The policy, as amended, would provide that the judiciary
    will pay the increases in the cost and associated expenses of the judges’
    insurance imposed after April 24, 1999, except that for any Article III judge
    appointed after March 15, 2005, the judiciary will pay these increases only
    while the judge remains in active service or where the judge retains the
    judicial office in senior status under § 371(b) or § 372(a) of title 28, U.S.
    Code. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

          Fixed-Term Judges. In September 2000, upon first learning that
    Congress was considering extending the FEGLI fix to bankruptcy and

                                          21
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      magistrate judges, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the
                      Conference, asked Congress to defer action until a complete review could be
                      accomplished (JCUS-SEP 00, pp. 39-40). Since that time, Congress, over the
                      objection of the Judicial Conference (JCUS-MAR 00, p. 19), extended the
                      FEGLI fix to judges on the Court of Federal Claims as part of the Federal
                      Courts Improvement Act of 2000, Public Law No. 106-518, and has been
                      receptive to extending it to United States Tax Court judges as well (see
                      section 314 of H.R. 1528, which passed both houses of the 108th Congress in
                      different forms). Based on this and other considerations, the Committee on
                      the Judicial Branch, with the concurrence of the Committees on the
                      Administration of the Bankruptcy System and the Administration of the
                      Magistrate Judges System, recommended that the Judicial Conference endorse
                      the concept of extending the FEGLI fix to bankruptcy and magistrate judges
                      (those who are in active status or are retired under the Judicial Retirement
                      System, 28 U.S.C. § 377) and territorial district court judges (those who are in
                      active status or are retired under 28 U.S.C. § 373), exclusive of those judges
                      who elect to engage in the practice of law after retirement under 28 U.S.C.
                      § 377(m) or § 373(d). Bankruptcy, magistrate, and territorial judges who elect
                      to practice law after retirement become ineligible for recall and, therefore,
                      consistent with the exclusion of Article III judges who retire from office under
                      28 U.S.C. § 371(a), are also ineligible for benefits under the FEGLI fix.
                      Finally, parity requires applying a similar limitation to retired Court of
                      Federal Claims judges. Therefore, the Committee recommended that the
                      Conference adopt a policy excepting from the FEGLI fix Court of Federal
                      Claims judges who elect to engage in the practice of law under 28 U.S.C.
                      § 178(j)(4). The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.


                      TRAVEL REGULATIONS FOR UNITED STATES
                      JUSTICES AND JUDGES

                             Judges’ Use of Special Lower Airfares. On recommendation of the
                      Committee, the Judicial Conference approved an amendment to section
                      D.2.a.(6) of the Travel Regulations for United States Justices and Judges
                      (Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, Vol. 3, Ch. C-5, Exh. A) to—

                      a.       Encourage judges to use discounted airfares, including penalty and
                               non-refundable tickets, as well as tickets requiring Saturday night stay-
                               overs, in the interest of economy when it is prudent to do so;




                                                              22
                                                                  March 15, 2005

b.     Authorize a judge’s reimbursement from appropriated funds for
       penalties or additional costs assessed for cancellations or changes in
       reservations; and

c.     Expressly authorize a judge’s reimbursement from appropriated funds
       for the additional cost of meals and lodging incurred in connection
       with a Saturday night stay-over, when such an arrangement represents
       a savings to the government.

The Committee was of the view that the savings the judiciary could obtain
from discount airfares would more than offset any charges assessed for
cancellations or changes in reservations.

         Home-to-Work Transportation for Disabled Judges. In order to
authorize government-provided home-to-work transportation for temporarily
disabled judges, a chief judge must comply with technical requirements and
restrictions provided in 31 U.S.C. § 1344 and section D.4 of the judges’ travel
regulations (Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, Vol. 3, Ch. C-5,
Exh. A, § D.4), some of which have been misinterpreted by the courts. In
order to clarify the time limits established in those provisions, the Committee
recommended, and the Conference approved, an amendment to section D.4. of
the travel regulations to specifically state that an initial determination that
compelling operational considerations exist to justify home-to-work
transportation for disabled judges is limited to a period of 15 days, with
extensions of not more than 90 calendar days where it is determined that
compelling operational considerations continue to exist. On recommendation
of the Committee, the Conference also updated the name of the House
Committee on Government Reform referenced in section D.4. of the judges’
travel regulations.


JUDICIAL COMPENSATION

        Pursuant to the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, the
mechanism for annually adjusting General Schedule employee pay includes
two components, an across-the-board pay adjustment based upon changes in
the Employment Cost Index (ECI) over a 12-month period, minus one half of
one percent, plus a comparability pay adjustment that is based on comparisons
of federal and nonfederal salaries in local areas and varies by pay locality
region. By contrast, the mechanism for annually adjusting salaries of judges,
members of Congress, Executive Schedule officials, and the Vice President,
set forth in the Ethics Reform Act, section 704 of Public Law No. 101-94,
includes only the ECI portion of the salary adjustment applicable to General

                                      23
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      Schedule employees. As a result, since 1994, the rates of pay of General
                      Schedule employees have risen by over 52 percent while the salaries of judges
                      and other senior government officials have only increased by just over 21
                      percent. On recommendation of the Committee on the Judicial Branch, the
                      Judicial Conference agreed to seek legislation to replace the Ethics Reform
                      Act’s ECI salary adjustment mechanism with a provision that would authorize
                      judges, members of Congress, Executive Schedule officials, and the Vice
                      President to receive an enhanced annual pay adjustment in an amount
                      equivalent to the overall average pay increase authorized for the General
                      Schedule under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that it continues to
                      pursue possible avenues of improving judicial compensation and benefits,
                      notwithstanding the constrained budget climate. The Committee is also
                      vigorously examining ways to improve judicial-legislative communications.
                      Education of the public, especially the media, on the judiciary and the role of
                      judges in society remains a priority of the Committee. The Committee hopes
                      that progress on each of these fronts will lead to the objective of maintaining
                      and enhancing the independence and dignity of the federal judicial office.


             COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES
                      ARTICLE III JUDGESHIP NEEDS

                              The Committee on Judicial Resources considered requests and
                      justifications for additional judgeships in the courts of appeals and the district
                      courts as part of its 2005 biennial judgeship survey process. For the district
                      court request, the Committee revised slightly the starting point for
                      recommending additional judgeships from weighted filings in excess of 430
                      per judgeship, to weighted filings in excess of 430 per judgeship with an
                      additional judgeship(s) and utilized new district court case weights. Based on
                      its review, and after considering the comments of the courts and the circuit
                      councils, the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference authorize
                      transmittal to Congress of a request for an additional nine permanent and three
                      temporary judgeships in the courts of appeals, and in the district courts, an
                      additional 44 permanent and 12 temporary judgeships, conversion to
                      permanent status of three existing temporary judgeships, and the extension of
                      one existing temporary judgeship for an additional five years. The

judgeship requests (“P” denotes permanent; “T” denotes temporary):

                      INTER-DISTRICT TRANSFER POLICY

                              Cost-containment measures recommended by the Committee on
                      Criminal Law and adopted by the Conference at its September 2004 session
                      (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 14-15) have resulted in the elimination of, or substantial
                      reduction in, specific categories of work performed by probation and pretrial
                      services offices. As these changes may impact staffing levels in some districts
                      more than in others, the Committee recommended, and the Judicial
                      Conference approved, adoption of the following resolution to acknowledge
                      the value of trained and experienced officers and to make clear that the
                      judiciary values its personnel:

                               Courts in a position to hire new probation and pretrial services
                               officers are strongly encouraged to consider hiring highly
                               qualified and well-trained officers from those federal courts
                               that are forced to make involuntary reductions in staff.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Judicial Resources reported that it endorsed project
                      plans presented by the Administrative Office for two initiatives: (a) a study of
                      compensation policies for all biweekly court employees in both chambers and
                      non-chambers positions; and (b) the development and implementation of a
                      process redesign program that would enhance the effectiveness and quality of
                      court unit functions, while defining measurable procedures to be included in
                      staffing formula development. Both of these initiatives are included in the
                      long-term cost-containment strategy approved by the Judicial Conference in
                      September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 5-7).

COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGES SYSTEM

    RECALL REGULATIONS

            The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges
    System recommended that the Conference approve technical and clarifying
    amendments to the Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United
    States Establishing Standards and Procedures for the Recall of United States
    Magistrate Judges (the ad hoc recall regulations) and the Regulations of the
    Judicial Conference of the United States Governing the Extended Service
    Recall of Retired United States Magistrate Judges (the extended service recall
    regulations) to (a) standardize the information that should be specified in the
    order of recall, (b) provide explicitly that the Magistrate Judges Committee
    has authority to approve or disapprove requests for staff for recalled
    magistrate judges (whose recall is subject to the Committee’s approval), and
    (c) change the title of the ad hoc recall regulations to “Regulations of the
    Judicial Conference of the United States Governing the Ad Hoc Recall of
    Retired United States Magistrate Judges,” to make it more accurate and
    consistent with the title for the extended service recall regulations. The
    Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


    CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE JUDGE POSITIONS

            After consideration of the report of the Committee on the
    Administration of the Magistrate Judges System and the recommendations of
    the Director of the Administrative Office, the respective district courts and
    judicial councils of the circuits, the Judicial Conference made no changes in
    the number, locations, salaries, or arrangements of the full-time and part-time
    magistrate judge positions in the following districts: the District of New
    Hampshire, the Eastern District of Louisiana, the Northern District of Iowa,
    the District of Nebraska, the District of North Dakota, the Northern District of
    California, the Southern District of California, and the Middle District of
    Alabama. In addition, on the Committee’s recommendation, the Judicial
    Conference determined not to authorize at this time filling a magistrate judge
    position in the District of Alaska at Anchorage when it becomes vacant in
    May 2005, with the understanding that the Magistrate Judges Committee will
    reconsider the court’s request to fill the vacancy at its December 2005
    meeting. The Judicial Conference made no other change in the number,
    locations, salaries, or arrangements of the magistrate judge positions in the
    District of Alaska.

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges
                      System reported that as part of its cost-containment effort it did not consider
                      any requests for new positions at its December 2004 meeting. In addition,
                      pursuant to a new Judicial Conference policy adopted in September 2004
                      (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 25), it conducted an enhanced review of magistrate judge
                      position vacancies to determine whether to authorize filling specific positions
                      (see supra, “Changes in Magistrate Judge Positions,” p. 28). The Committee
                      also discussed a forthcoming proposal of the Social Security Administration
                      to overhaul its disability claims process, and resolved that, “[c]onsistent with
                      its long-standing view that magistrate judge adjudication of civil cases with
                      litigant consent improves efficiency and should be encouraged, the Magistrate
                      Judges Committee recommends that parties consider consenting to magistrate
                      judge adjudication of social security appeals in any district court in which
                      such appeals are referred to magistrate judges.”


             COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
                      FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE

                              The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                      Judicial Conference proposed amendments to Bankruptcy Rules 2002
                      (Notices to Creditors, Equity Security Holders, United States, and United
                      States Trustee), 9001 (General Definitions), and 9036 (Notice by Electronic
                      Transmission), together with Committee notes explaining their purpose and
                      intent. The Judicial Conference approved the amendments – which were
                      processed on an expedited schedule because of expected cost savings for the
                      federal judiciary – and authorized their transmittal to the Supreme Court for

                      and transmitted to Congress in accordance with law.


                      FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

                              The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                      Judicial Conference proposed new Civil Rule 5.1 (Constitutional Challenge to
                      a Statute – Notice, Certification, and Intervention) and proposed conforming
                      amendments to Civil Rule 24 (Intervention), together with Committee notes
                      explaining their purpose and intent. The Judicial Conference approved the

       new rule and amendments and authorized their transmittal to the Supreme
       Court for its consideration with a recommendation that they be adopted by the
       Court and transmitted to Congress in accordance with law.


       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

               The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure approved for
       publication proposed style amendments to Civil Rules 23 and 64-86,
       completing its style revision of the Civil Rules. (The Committee had earlier
       approved proposed style amendments to Civil Rules 1-63 for publication once
       all revisions under consideration were completed.) The Committee also
       approved for publication a small number of minor style/substance
       amendments that make modest, non-controversial changes to the Civil Rules,
       as well as amendments intended to resolve “global issues” in the Civil Rules.
       The entire package of proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil
       Procedure (Civil Rules 1-86) were published in February 2005, with the
       public comment period to end on December 15, 2005. The Committee also
       approved for publication proposed amendments to Bankruptcy Rules 1014,
       3007, and 7007.1. The Advisory Committees on Appellate, Bankruptcy,
       Civil, Criminal, and Evidence Rules are reviewing comments from the public
       submitted on amendments to their respective sets of rules proposed in August
       and November 2004.


COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND FACILITIES
      NON-PROSPECTUS SPACE MORATORIUM

              In order to control rental costs, in March 2004, the Committee on
      Security and Facilities approved a one-year moratorium, until March 2005, on
      all non-prospectus space requests (projects costing less than $2.36 million in
      FY 2005), except requests for courtrooms, chambers, lease renewals, official
      parking, and recovery from natural disasters or terrorist attacks (JCUS-MAR
      04, p. 28).2 At this session, on recommendation of the Committee, the
      Conference extended the moratorium to March 2006, to allow additional time
      for the development of space cost-control mechanisms. The Director of the


2
 In September 2004, the Conference approved a similar moratorium on all non-
prospectus space requests for federal defender organizations (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 15-
16).

Judicial Conference of the United States

                     Administrative Office is authorized to make limited exceptions to the
                     moratorium in consultation with the circuit representative to the Security and
                     Facilities Committee and in coordination with the circuit judicial council, the
                     Budget Committee, and the Executive Committee.


                     CLOSING COURT FACILITIES

                             Using criteria established in March 1997 (JCUS-MAR 97, pp. 17-20),
                     the Committee conducted its biennial review of nationwide space assignments
                     to determine the need for non-resident visiting judge facilities. Courts were
                     asked to release all space that was not absolutely necessary in light of the
                     budgetary constraints facing the judiciary. Based on this review, the
                     Committee recommended, and the Conference approved, the release of space
                     and closure of the non-resident court facility in Dubuque, Iowa, and the release
                     of space in Houma, Louisiana.


                     COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                             The Committee on Security and Facilities reported that, in order to
                     achieve necessary Federal Protective Service (FPS) cost reductions, it
                     determined to survey courts about the possibility of reducing or eliminating 24-
                     hours-a-day/seven-days-a-week FPS contract guard posts, including weekend
                     and holiday coverage (when buildings are largely empty); 9:00 p.m to 6:00
                     a.m. weekday posts; and any weekday daytime posts when court security
                     officers (CSOs) are also working. In addition, to examine the CSO staffing
                     formula and hearing standards, the Committee determined to acquire the
                     assistance of two experts: one who would evaluate CSO duties and the staffing
                     formula and the other who would advise the Committee on whether to change
                     the hearing standards. The Committee also approved a resolution
                     recommending that rent, which is currently paid from the Salaries and
                     Expenses account, be funded through a separate appropriation within the
                     judiciary’s budget. The Security and Facilities Committee forwarded the
                     resolution to the Budget Committee for its consideration, which determined to
                     take the matter under advisement.

MEMORIAL RESOLUTION
           The Judicial Conference approved the following resolution noting the
    death of the Honorable Richard S. Arnold of the Eighth Circuit Court of
    Appeals:

                   With profound sadness, the Judicial Conference of the
           United States notes the death of the Honorable Richard S.
           Arnold of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
           Circuit, on September 23, 2004, in Rochester, Minnesota.

                    Judge Arnold served with preeminent distinction as a
           jurist for nearly 26 years, beginning on the federal district
           courts in Arkansas and continuing on the Eighth Circuit
           appellate bench. He was chief judge of his circuit from
           January 1992 until April 1998, and he continued to perform
           valuable judicial service until right before his death, having
           assumed senior judge status in April 2001.

                   Judge Arnold was a pillar of the federal judiciary, both
           within the Eighth Circuit and on the national scene. A
           recipient of the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to
           Justice Award in 1999, he made significant, enduring
           contributions to the administration of justice, the rule of law,
           and the improvement of society.

                   Judge Arnold’s invaluable support of the work of the
           Judicial Conference began shortly after he took the bench and
           continued for the remainder of his life. He served initially on
           the Ad Hoc Committee on Regulatory Reform Legislation from
           1981 to 1984, and on the Judicial Improvements Subcommittee
           of the Committee on Court Administration from 1983 to 1987.
           In late 1987, the Chief Justice selected him to chair the
           Committee on the Budget, a position he went on to hold for
           nine years. As budget chairman, he presided over important
           changes in the judiciary’s budgetary processes and was a
           highly effective advocate for the needs and accomplishments
           of the third branch during times of increasing fiscal austerity in
           the federal government.

                  During his six years as chief circuit judge, Judge
           Arnold was also a member of this body and, by appointment of


                                          31
Judicial Conference of the United States

                               the Chief Justice, the Conference’s Executive Committee. In
                               recent years, he was called upon again to serve the judiciary at
                               the national level—as vice chair of the Committee on the
                               Judicial Branch, where he labored tirelessly to improve the
                               adequacy of judicial compensation. Throughout his
                               Conference and committee service, Judge Arnold was an
                               outstanding judicial leader and ambassador who rightly earned
                               the esteem of his fellow judges and all others with whom he
                               dealt.

                                       Judge Arnold represented the best qualities seen in
                               federal judges. Though blessed with rare intellectual gifts,
                               unquestioned integrity, and a statesmanlike bearing, he was
                               also a modest, gracious and warmhearted man, with great
                               sensitivity for human freedom and dignity. Possessed of a
                               keen, dry wit, he challenged and inspired his colleagues.
                               America has lost a superior jurist, the judiciary has lost a great
                               colleague, and all of us have lost a good friend.

                                      As a sign of their affection and respect, the members of
                               the Judicial Conference convey their deepest sympathies to
                               Judge Arnold’s widow, Kay, and to his family.


             FUNDING
                              All of the foregoing recommendations that require the expenditure of
                      funds for implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to
                      the availability of funds and to whatever priorities the Conference might
                      establish for the use of available resources.
