                 HONORABLE SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR.
                  Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules

            Appointed as committee chairs by Chief Justice William
       H. Rehnquist, these outstanding jurists have played a vital role
       in the administration of the federal court system. These judges
       served with distinction as leaders of their Judicial Conference
       committees while, at the same time, continuing to perform their
       duties as judges in their own courts. They have set a standard
       of skilled leadership and earned our deep respect and sincere
       gratitude for their innumerable contributions. We
       acknowledge with appreciation their commitment and
       dedicated service to the Judicial Conference and to the entire
       federal judiciary.


NEW BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION

         The Executive Committee was asked to approve on behalf of the
Judicial Conference a number of emergency measures required to facilitate
timely implementation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 (Public Law No. 109-8), which generally takes effect
on October 17, 2005. On recommendation of the Committee on Rules of
Practice and Procedure, the Executive Committee adopted new and revised
official bankruptcy forms for nationwide use and, to facilitate uniformity of
practice until the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure can be amended to
reflect the new legislation, agreed to authorize distribution to the courts of
proposed changes in the Bankruptcy Rules that can be adopted in individual
districts by local rule or general order as interim rules. On recommendation
of the Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System, the
Executive Committee also approved interim procedures for in forma pauperis
waivers of chapter 7 filing fees and interim guidelines for certification of
credit counseling agencies and debtor education programs.


JUDICIAL SECURITY COMMITTEE

        Because of increased concerns for the personal safety of judges and
their families, the Executive Committee recommended to the Conference that
the Committee on Security and Facilities be divided into a Committee on
Judicial Security and a Committee on Space and Facilities so that a committee
could devote its efforts entirely to security matters. With the approval of the
Chief Justice, the Conference was polled by mail ballot and adopted the
recommendation. The Executive Committee approved jurisdictional

Judicial Conference of the United States

                      statements for the two committees and determined that the organizational
                      change would take effect on October 1, 2005.


                      HURRICANE KATRINA RESOLUTION

                             The Judicial Conference approved a recommendation of the Executive
                      Committee, introduced as new business on the Conference floor, to adopt the
                      following resolution expressing appreciation for the efforts of judiciary
                      employees related to Hurricane Katrina:

                                   The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with
                               deepest appreciation the extraordinary performance and
                               exemplary dedication to the administration of justice of the
                               federal court personnel who are working to help the affected
                               courts recover from the devastation wrought by Hurricane
                               Katrina.

                                    The Conference expresses special thanks to the judges and
                               court employees of the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits who have
                               suffered great personal loss but continue to work tirelessly to
                               restore court operations. The Conference also recognizes the
                               extraordinary efforts of the chief judges and their staffs who
                               have displayed remarkable leadership under the most difficult
                               of circumstances. The courage, commitment, and hard work of
                               the court personnel in these locations have enabled the affected
                               courts to continue to serve the public – some in their own
                               courthouses and others in temporary quarters – and help to
                               hasten the return of those courts to normal operations.

                                    The Conference also would like to acknowledge the fine
                               work and generosity of the entire federal court family. Across
                               the country, judges, court employees, and Administrative
                               Office staff members have devoted countless hours to assisting
                               their colleagues in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina, and
                               many are also supplying personal financial and other assistance
                               to hurricane victims.

                                     Finally, on behalf of the entire federal judiciary, the
                               Judicial Conference pledges support and encouragement for the
                               ongoing recovery effort and offers the deepest sympathy to
                               everyone who has lost family, friends, homes, or livelihood in
                               this terrible disaster. The Conference acknowledges with pride
                               the federal judiciary's response to the challenges of recovery –


                                                              6

       a response that shows firm determination and a strong,
       cooperative spirit.


MEMORIAL RESOLUTION FOR
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST

       The Executive Committee approved, and the Judicial Conference
affirmed, the following resolution expressing deep regret at the death of the
Honorable William H. Rehnquist of the Supreme Court of the United States:

           The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with
       sadness the death, on September 3, 2005, of the Honorable

                    WILLIAM HUBBS REHNQUIST

       Chief Justice of the United States. A Wisconsin native and an
       adopted son of Arizona, he was born in Milwaukee in 1924,
       and he served in the United States Army Air Corps in North
       Africa in World War II. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of
       Stanford University and received Master of Arts degrees from
       both Stanford and Harvard University. He graduated first in
       his class from Stanford Law School in 1952, and served as law
       clerk to Associate Justice Robert H. Jackson at the Supreme
       Court of the United States.

            Chief Justice Rehnquist entered private practice in
       Phoenix in 1953, and in 1969 was appointed Assistant
       Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel in the Department
       of Justice. In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon nominated
       him to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the
       United States; he was confirmed by the Senate and took his
       oath as the 100th Justice in January 1972.

            Nominated to serve as Chief Justice by President Ronald
       Reagan in June of 1986, he became the 16th Chief Justice of the
       United States on September 26 of that year. In 1999, he
       became the second Chief Justice in the history of the United
       States to preside over an impeachment trial of a president of
       the United States.

           The Chief Justice excelled in administering the federal
       courts. The Chief Justice displayed his leadership in the
       Judicial Conference of the United States almost immediately


                                      7
Judicial Conference of the United States

                               by appointing in 1986 a committee of federal judges to study
                               the organization and operations of the Conference, the first
                               such effort in 17 years. He took his role in the Conference
                               structure seriously, and through the establishment of term
                               limits, he significantly expanded the numbers of judges
                               appointed to serve on Conference committees. Chief Justice
                               Rehnquist presided at the semi-annual Judicial Conference
                               sessions for almost two decades with a firm hand. He ran
                               efficient, effective meetings – showing respect for the rules of
                               order and expecting succinctness in presentation, while
                               demonstrating the wit that was his hallmark. His tenure as
                               head of the judicial branch encompassed, among many other
                               things, the Federal Courts Study Committee, the Powell
                               Committee on capital habeas corpus remedies, which he
                               established, and the White Commission study on the structural
                               alternatives for the federal appellate courts.

                                    Chief Justice Rehnquist loved history as well as the law,
                               and he was the author of four books. Above all, he was a man
                               of integrity and courtesy, deep humility, and courage.

                                    We mourn the passing of our Chief, a great jurist and good
                               friend, and we express our deepest sympathy to his family,
                               which he loved above all else.


                      MISCELLANEOUS ACTIONS

                            The Executive Committee—

                      •     On recommendation of the Committees on Court Administration and
                            Case Management and Information Technology, approved and
                            authorized transmittal to Congress of the annual report for 2005 on
                            deferred court compliance with section 205 of the E-Government Act of
                            2002 (Public Law No. 107-347);

                      •     Adopted a Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure
                            recommendation to request that the Supreme Court withdraw a proposed
                            amendment to Rule 4008 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure
                            so that it could be recommitted to the Committee for further
                            consideration in light of its inconsistency with a provision of the new
                            Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005;




                                                              8
                                                              September 20, 2005

•   Approved a recommendation of the Committee on Financial Disclosure
    to authorize the chair of that committee to work on the Conference’s
    behalf to obtain enactment of legislation extending, in the broadest
    possible terms, the Conference authority to redact financial disclosure
    reports for security purposes that is scheduled to expire on December 31,
    2005, with the understanding that, if extension is otherwise unattainable,
    the Conference would not oppose legislation limiting that authority to
    protection against physical danger;

•   On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, approved a
    revised Statement of Reasons form to be attached to the Judgment in a
    Criminal Case;

•   On recommendation of the Committee on the Budget, agreed to seek
    legislation to give the judiciary the flexibility in multi-year contracting
    and contract payments already permitted to executive branch and certain
    legislative branch agencies;

•   Approved interim fiscal year 2006 financial plans for the Salaries and
    Expenses, Defender Services, Court Security, and Fees of Jurors and
    Commissioners accounts, and for the Electronic Public Access program,
    pending congressional enactment of the judiciary’s appropriations for
    fiscal year 2006;

•   Recommitted to the Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction a
    recommendation regarding the proposed REAL ID Act of 2005
    (H.R. 418 and H.R. 1268, 109th Congress) for development of a more
    general position that would address any legislation intended to preclude
    judicial review of constitutional claims (see also infra, “Legislation to
    Eliminate Federal Court Jurisdiction,” p. 23);

•   Approved an amended jurisdictional statement for the Committee to
    Review Circuit Council Conduct and Disability Orders that reflects
    minor technical changes to the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act;

•   Approved a recommendation of the Committee on Judicial Resources
    that the judiciary seek legislation to amend 5 U.S.C. § 6391(a)(2) to
    include judicial branch agencies among those agencies authorized to
    participate in emergency leave transfer programs; and

•   Deferred for six months implementation of a policy adopted by the
    Conference in March 2005 relating to funding of circuit judicial
    conferences so that various practical issues could be studied.

Judicial Conference of the United States

             COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that it
                      considered issues regarding pay parity between executive-level employees in
                      the judiciary and the executive branch and expressed support for the AO
                      Director to apply to AO executives any interim adjustments in salary caps
                      approved by the Judicial Conference for court executives (see “Executive
                      Compensation,” infra, p. 29). The Committee also endorsed pursuing
                      statutory authorities for AO executive pay comparable to those that already
                      exist or that will be sought in the future for court executives, in order to
                      achieve parity with the executive branch. In light of renewed interest in
                      Congress regarding an inspector general for the judiciary, the Committee
                      determined that there is no reason to propose any change to the Judicial
                      Conference policy strongly opposing an inspector general for the judiciary
                      (JCUS-MAR 96, p. 7).

                      OFFICIAL DUTY STATIONS/
                      PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

                              The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of
                      2005, enacted on April 20, 2005, authorizes the appointment of 28 new
                      bankruptcy judgeships in 21 districts. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 152(b)(1), the
                      Judicial Conference is responsible for determining the official duty stations of
                      bankruptcy judges and their places of holding court, based on
                      recommendations of the Director of the Administrative Office, who in turn
                      must consult with the respective judicial councils. After considering the
                      requests of the judicial councils (some of which requested permission to move
                      an incumbent bankruptcy judge to a new duty station and to locate the newly
                      created judgeship at the original duty station), the Bankruptcy Committee
                      recommended, and the Judicial Conference approved, the following
                      designations of official duty stations and places of holding court:

                      RETIREMENT REGULATIONS

                               For each bankruptcy or magistrate judge covered under the Federal
                      Employees’ Retirement System, the government contributes up to five percent
                      of salary to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) on behalf of that judge, one percent
                      automatically and up to four percent as a matching contribution. However, if
                      a judge then later elects to participate in the Judicial Retirement System
                      (JRS), 5 U.S.C. § 8440b(b)(7) requires that any annuity received under JRS be
                      offset by an amount equal to the portion of any TSP distribution the judge
                      received that represents the government’s earlier contribution to TSP. Noting
                      that § 6.03(e) of the Regulations of the Director Implementing the Retirement
                      and Survivors’ Annuities for Bankruptcy Judges and Magistrates Act of 1988
                      is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. § 8440b(b)(7) because it treats any contributions
                      still unrecovered at the time of a judge’s death as a debt to the government,
                      even though there is no longer a JRS annuity to offset, the Committee
                      recommended that the section be deleted. Since § 6.03(e) also applies to
                      magistrate judges, the Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate
                      Judges System made the same recommendation (see infra “Retirement
                      Regulations,” p. 33). The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendation.

    CONFIDENTIALITY OF TAX INFORMATION

            The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of
    2005 expands the list of tax documents a debtor must file under 11 U.S.C.
    § 521 and requires that courts make these documents available to any party in
    interest in accordance with procedures (to be established by the Director of
    the Administrative Office) that safeguard the confidentiality of the
    information. On recommendation of the Committee and pursuant to the Act,
    the Conference agreed to adopt the “Director’s Interim Guidance Regarding
    Tax Information under 11 U.S.C. § 521,” which balances the disclosure
    requirements of section 521 with the need to protect sensitive financial and
    personal information from unrestricted dissemination.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Bankruptcy Committee reported that it reaffirmed its long-
    standing view that the bankruptcy administrator program should be retained
    within the judiciary. It also received status reports on a wide range of topics,
    including the activities of its Subcommittee on Automation to address
    automation concerns of bankruptcy judges, a study of venue-related issues
    being conducted by a joint subcommittee of the Bankruptcy Committee and
    the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules, the Administrative Office
    study on administrative resources, and developments regarding consumer
    education programs.


COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
    FISCAL YEAR 2007 BUDGET REQUEST

            In recognition of continuing budgetary constraints, the Budget
    Committee recommended a fiscal year 2007 budget request that reflected a
    number of cost-containment measures. The Judicial Conference approved the
    budget request subject to amendments that may become necessary as a result
    of (a) new legislation, (b) actions of the Judicial Conference, or (c) any other
    reason the Executive Committee considers necessary and appropriate.

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Budget reported that it discussed the judiciary’s
                      ongoing efforts to acquire additional resources from Congress and the
                      program committees’ progress on implementing the Judicial Conference-
                      approved cost-containment strategy. The Committee also discussed judicial
                      travel and space rental issues, and endorsed seeking appropriate legislation to
                      affirm the judiciary’s need for increased procurement flexibility (see supra,
                      “Miscellaneous Actions,” pp. 8-9).


             COMMITTEE ON CODES OF CONDUCT
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that since its last report
                      to the Conference in March 2005, the Committee received 19 new written
                      inquiries and issued 18 written advisory responses (one inquiry was
                      withdrawn). During this period, the average response time for requests was
                      16 days. The Chairman received and responded to 23 informal inquiries (by
                      telephone, electronic mail, or in person), and the other Committee members
                      responded individually to 166 informal inquiries from their colleagues.


             COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
             AND CASE MANAGEMENT

                      RESTRUCTURING THE NINTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT

                              In response to efforts in the 108th and 109th Congresses to link
                      authorization of new judgeships requested by the judiciary to legislation to
                      restructure the Ninth Judicial Circuit (i.e., to split it into two or three circuits),
                      the Executive Committee asked the Committees on Court Administration
                      and Case Management and Judicial Resources to advise the Conference on
                      whether it should take a position on the proposed circuit split and, if so, what
                      considerations should inform that position. Following discussion, the
                      Conference agreed to adopt the following recommendations of the Committee
                      on Court Administration and Case Management:




                                                               14
                                                                 September 20, 2005

a.   The Conference’s consideration of the issue of splitting the Ninth Circuit
     should be independently based on the circuit split issue alone and should
     not be driven by possible linkage of that issue to a judgeship bill.

b.   The Conference should not take a position either endorsing or opposing
     legislation providing for the split of the Ninth Circuit.

c.   The Conference should continue to provide Congress with such
     information on the current status of court administration and case
     management in the Ninth Circuit as Congress may request.

d.   While neither endorsing nor opposing the merits of proposals to divide
     the Ninth Circuit, the Conference should strongly emphasize to Congress
     the impact the existing proposals would have on the judiciary as well
     as on the citizens it serves, specifically, (i) the extent to which a split
     would exacerbate the current imbalance between the number of appeals
     originating in California and the number of appellate judges available to
     hear these cases and (ii) the uncertain amount of appropriations to
     support the new circuit structures.

e.   The Conference should endorse the report entitled “Position of the
     Committee on Court Administration and Case Management Regarding
     Legislation to Divide the Ninth Circuit” to the extent it is not inconsistent
     with the recommendations specifically approved by the Conference.

The Conference took additional actions with regard to this issue (see infra,
“Restructuring the Ninth Judicial Circuit,” p. 29).


ELECTRONIC TRANSCRIPTS

        In September 2003, the Judicial Conference adopted a policy requiring
courts that make documents electronically available via the Public Access to
Court Electronic Records (PACER) system also to make prepared electronic
transcripts of court proceedings available remotely. To address privacy
concerns, the policy includes a process for redacting personal identifying
information from transcripts. The Conference deferred implementation of the
policy, however, until it could consider a report to be prepared by the
Committee on Judicial Resources regarding the impact the policy would have
on court reporter compensation (JCUS-SEP 03, pp. 16-17). After considering
the Judicial Resources Committee’s report, presented to the Conference at this
session, as well as information submitted by court reporters and the views of
the Committees on Defender Services and Information Technology, the

Judicial Conference of the United States

                      Committee on Court Administration and Case Management recommended
                      that the Conference implement its policy on electronic availability of
                      transcripts by —

                      a.   Adopting a $.75 per-page fee for remote electronic public access to
                           transcripts, providing that a portion of that transcript fee be paid to the
                           court reporter who prepared the transcript and setting that portion at $.50
                           per page, and directing the judiciary to retain the remainder of the fee
                           ($.25 per page, which includes the current public access fee of $.08 per
                           page) to recoup the cost of developing, maintaining, and operating the
                           systems to perform these functions;

                      b.   Seeking appropriate legislation necessary to effectuate these fees;

                      c.   Authorizing the expansion of the existing pilot project on the electronic
                           availability of transcripts – for at least six months – while the
                           modifications noted above are implemented; and

                      d.   Directing this Committee, as part of the ongoing pilot project, to work
                           with the Defender Services Committee to evaluate the impact of the
                           policy on the Defender Services program (i.e., develop cost estimates for
                           the Defender Services budget and examine implementation issues) and to
                           determine whether to recommend changes to the policy.

                      The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.


                      ATTORNEY ADMISSION FEE FOR THE COURT OF
                      FEDERAL CLAIMS

                              The Judicial Conference adopted a recommendation of the Committee
                      on Court Administration and Case Management to increase the attorney
                      admission fee for the United States Court of Federal Claims from $50 to $150.
                      This makes the Court of Federal Claims fee consistent with the attorney
                      admission fee charged in the district courts, which was raised to $150 in
                      March 2004 (JCUS-MAR 04, p. 9), and in the courts of appeals, which was
                      established at $150 in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 12).


                      FEE FOR TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES IN THE COURTS

                             In September 1997, the Judicial Conference agreed to seek legislation
                      to authorize the judiciary to establish fees for the use of court-provided



                                                             16
                                                               September 20, 2005

technology resources (JCUS-SEP 97, p. 62). Since that time, there have been
legislative and other changes affecting the establishment, collection, and
retention of fees by the judiciary that obviate the need for seeking such
legislation. Therefore, on the Committee’s recommendation, the Conference
agreed to rescind its position to seek legislation that would expressly provide
for fee authority for technology resources in the courts.


APPOINTING AUTHORITY FOR CIRCUIT LIBRARIANS

        In September 2001, the Conference adopted a recommendation of the
then Committee on Automation and Technology (which at that time had
jurisdiction over the library program) to seek legislation amending 28 U.S.C.
§ 713 to provide that circuit librarians be selected and hired by the circuit
judicial councils rather than by the courts of appeals. This was one of a
number of recommendations intended to improve library program governance
(JCUS-SEP/OCT 01, pp. 42-43). After reviewing the breadth of services
librarians are providing and the level of coordination that currently takes place
between the chief circuit judges and library committees or the circuit judicial
councils, the Court Administration and Case Management Committee
determined that this proposed legislation was not necessary. The Committee
recommended that the Conference rescind its September 2001 position
seeking change in the appointing authority for circuit librarians, and the
Conference agreed.


GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION REQUIREMENT
FOR COURT RECORDS

        In March 2001, on recommendation of the then Committee on
Automation and Technology (which had jurisdiction over records
management issues at that time), the Judicial Conference agreed to pursue
legislation that would eliminate the requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 457 that
records be kept at a place where court is held (JCUS-MAR 01, pp. 7-8). The
intent of seeking such legislation was to ensure that electronic records of a
court could be maintained on servers that might not be located at a place
where court was actually held. It was subsequently determined that such
legislation was unnecessary as electronic court records are accessible at the
courthouse, as well as at other locations, through the courts’ Case
Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) system, and therefore the
statutory requirements are met and actually exceeded. The Conference
adopted the Committee’s recommendation that the position be rescinded.

                      LAWBOOKS AND LIBRARIES

                               On recommendation of the Committee on Court Administration and
                      Case Management, the Conference, as part of the judiciary’s cost-containment
                      efforts, adopted a policy with regard to lawbooks and libraries that judges
                      (a) maintain only those subscriptions to print case reporters deemed essential
                      to chambers, (b) cancel all existing subscriptions to print case reporters that
                      are not essential to chambers, and (c) give serious consideration to whether
                      subscriptions to law journals, law reviews, and treatises are essential. The
                      Conference also approved the Committee’s recommendation that the policy be
                      implemented through the librarians with the assistance and participation of the
                      chief judges of the appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts. Finally, on the
                      Committee’s recommendation, the Conference recognized that, although print
                      case reporters are not deemed essential by all judges, the responses from a
                      large number of judges to a questionnaire regarding lawbooks clearly show
                      that, for a significant number of judges, print reporters remain an essential
                      resource for carrying out the courts’ fundamental mission of administering
                      justice.


                      MODEL LOCAL RULES FOR ELECTRONIC FILING

                               The Judicial Conference adopted model local rules for electronic filing
                      in civil and bankruptcy cases in September 2001 and in criminal cases in
                      September 2003 and delegated to the Committee on Court Administration and
                      Case Management the authority to make routine, technical and/or non-
                      substantive modifications to these model local rules (JCUS-SEP/OCT 01,
                      p. 50; JCUS-SEP 03, p. 15). At this session, on recommendation of that
                      Committee, the Conference adopted model local rules for appellate electronic
                      case filing with a similar delegation of authority to the Committee to make
                      subsequent routine, technical, and/or non-substantive modifications.
                      Adoption of the rules by individual appellate courts is discretionary, and it is
                      expected that each court will tailor the rules to fit its local situations.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                      reported that, among other things, it discussed the impact on the courts of the
                      judiciary’s policy on privacy and public access to electronic case files and
                      requested that the Federal Judicial Center conduct a study of this issue. The
                      Committee also reviewed a draft of the American Bar Association's



                                                            18

    “Principles for Juries and Jury Trials,” and created a subcommittee to review
    the principles in greater detail. The Committee was also briefed on the efforts
    by the Administrative Office to work with the National Archives and Records
    Administration regarding the implementation of an agreement reached to
    permit the disposal of paper documents after they have been scanned into the
    Case Management/Electronic Case Files system. The Committee reiterated its
    support for the agreement and urged its implementation as quickly as possible.


COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAW
    CONTRACTING AUTHORITY FOR
    NON-TREATMENT SERVICES

            In addition to broad general contracting authority under 28 U.S.C.
    § 604(a), the Director of the Administrative Office has explicit authority
    under 18 U.S.C. § 3672 to contract for reentry services for federal offenders
    addicted to drugs or suffering from a mental defect who are under post-
    conviction supervision. Such services include substance abuse and mental
    health treatment, and medical, educational, social, vocational training, and/or
    other rehabilitative interventions. Noting that all offenders could benefit from
    transitional services such as emergency housing and vocational training, the
    Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference seek legislation to
    explicitly authorize the AO Director to contract for non-treatment services
    (e.g., medical, educational, emergency housing, and vocational training) and
    other reentry interventions for post-conviction supervision offenders
    generally. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


    POST-CONVICTION SUPERVISION MONOGRAPH

            On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, the Judicial
    Conference approved revisions to The Supervision of Federal Offenders,
    Monograph 109, for publication and distribution to the courts. The revisions,
    modeled after the early termination policy applicable to parolees and other
    offenders under the jurisdiction of the United States Parole Commission,
    create a presumption in favor of recommending early termination of
    supervised releasees and probationers who —

    a.   have been under supervision for at least 18 months and

         1. are not career violent and/or drug offenders, sex offenders, or
            terrorists,

                      PRETRIAL SERVICES SUPERVISION MONOGRAPH

                              On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
                      approved revisions to The Supervision of Federal Defendants, Monograph
                      111, for publication and distribution to the courts. The revisions incorporate
                      program changes that implement cost-containment measures approved by the
                      Judicial Conference in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 14-15). The
                      revisions are designed to limit the growth in the number of offenders under
                      pretrial services supervision, reduce pretrial services supervision program
                      requirements, and contain costs in substance abuse treatment services paid for
                      by the judiciary.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Criminal Law reported that it proposed revisions to
                      the Statement of Reasons attached to the Judgment in a Criminal Case forms
                      (AO 245B and AO 245C) in view of the Supreme Court decision in the
                      consolidated cases, United States v. Booker/United States v. Fanfan, 125 S.Ct.
                      738 (2005). The revisions, which were approved by the Executive Committee
                      on behalf of the Conference, are designed to enable the Sentencing
                      Commission to determine more precisely the number of sentences imposed
                      (1) within the advisory guideline sentencing range, (2) within the advisory
                      guidelines as adjusted by any departure under the advisory guidelines
                      (including departures initiated or supported by the government), and
                      (3) outside the advisory guideline system based on the sentencing judge's
                      articulation of other sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)
                      (including those sentencing adjustments initiated or supported by the
                      government). In addition, the Committee unanimously agreed to generally
                      support the revisions to the U.S. Courts Design Guide recommended by the
                      Committee on Security and Facilities that would reduce the square footage for
                      office space related to probation and pretrial services staff.

COMMITTEE ON DEFENDER SERVICES
       CASE BUDGETING

               Pilot Project. In order to control costs of Criminal Justice Act
       representations in capital cases and non-capital “mega-cases,” the Committee
       on Defender Services recommended, and the Judicial Conference approved, a
       pilot project lasting up to three years wherein the Defender Services
       appropriation would fund up to three circuit positions to support the case-
       budgeting process. These positions are intended to provide objective case-
       budgeting advice to judges and enhance management of, and accountability
       for, the cases most significantly affecting the Defender Services account.

                Investigative and Expert Services. Concerned that some panel
       attorneys are delaying pursuit of aspects of their representation during the
       initial stages of the case-budgeting process, the Committee recommended that
       the Conference amend paragraphs 2.22B(4) and 6.02F of the Guidelines for
       the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act and Related Statutes (CJA
       Guidelines), Volume 7, Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, to state
       that courts, pending submission and approval of case budgets, should act upon
       requests for investigative, expert, and other services where prompt
       authorization is necessary for adequate representation. The Conference
       approved the Committee’s recommendation.


       NON-PROSPECTUS SPACE MORATORIUM

               On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed
       to continue for one year, until September 2006, the moratorium initially
       imposed in September 2004 on all federal defender organization non-
       prospectus space requests,1 except requests for lease renewals, official
       parking, and space necessary for recovery from natural disasters or terrorist
       attacks. The Director is authorized to make limited exceptions in consultation
       with the Defender Services Committee’s chair and the Committee member
       who is the liaison to the federal defender’s circuit. Any exceptions involving
       space requests for federal public defender organizations will also require
       coordination with the circuit judicial council.




1
Non-prospectus space requests are those whose construction costs are less than $2.36
million in FY 2005, and less than $2.47 million in FY 2006.

                      LOCATION OF FEDERAL DEFENDER OFFICE SPACE

                              In September 2003, the Judicial Conference amended the U.S. Courts
                      Design Guide to provide, among other things, that federal defender offices
                      must be located outside the courthouse, or other federal buildings housing law
                      enforcement agencies, unless the federal defender has determined that the
                      location would not compromise the defender organization’s ability to fulfill its
                      mission (JCUS-SEP 03, p. 38). At this session, in order to ensure that the
                      independent character and image of the federal defender function is
                      maintained, and that the fiscal impact of locating a defender office in a
                      courthouse has been fully examined, the Committee on Defender Services
                      recommended that the policy be amended to require the Defender Services
                      Committee’s approval before locating a defender office in a courthouse and,
                      further, that the revision be reflected in the Design Guide. The Conference
                      adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                      PANEL ATTORNEY COMPENSATION

                              Non-Capital Compensation Rate. On recommendation of the
                      Committee, the Judicial Conference approved revisions to paragraphs
                      2.22A(1) through (3) of the CJA Guidelines to reflect the increase by
                      Congress of the non-capital hourly rate for panel attorneys to $90 and to
                      delete obsolete provisions for establishing alternative hourly rates up to $75.

                             Capital Compensation Rate. The Conference approved a Committee
                      recommendation to revise paragraphs 6.02A(1)(a) and 6.02B(1) of the CJA
                      Guidelines to reflect the recent increase by Congress in the maximum capital
                      hourly rate from $125 to $160.

                              Interim Voucher Withholding Percentage. Sample interim voucher
                      orders for non-capital panel attorney claims and for capital and non-capital
                      claims from investigative, expert, and other service providers, contained in
                      Appendices E and F of the CJA Guidelines, include provisions for
                      withholding one-third of compensation on interim vouchers. The purpose of
                      the withholding provision is to strike a balance between the interest in
                      relieving court-appointed attorneys of financial hardships in extended and
                      complex cases, and in preserving the statutorily imposed responsibility of the
                      chief judge of the circuit to provide a meaningful review of claims for excess
                      compensation (CJA Guideline 2.30A). Noting that these objectives could be
                      accomplished by withholding less than one-third of compensation, the
                      Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference endorse revisions to
                      the sample interim voucher orders contained in Appendices E and F of the


                                                             22
                                                                    September 20, 2005

    CJA Guidelines to reduce the suggested one-third of compensation
    withholding amount to 20 percent. The Conference approved the
    Committee’s recommendation.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Defender Services reported that under its delegated
    authority from the Judicial Conference (JCUS-MAR 89, pp. 16-17), it
    approved FY 2006 federal defender organization budgets and grants totaling
    $423,163,000. In addition, after considering proposed changes to the U.S.
    Courts Design Guide, the Committee communicated its recommendations to
    the Security and Facilities Committee, including its agreement with the
    proposed removal of federal defender space standards from the Guide and the
    development of a separate set of standards. The Committee reviewed
    materials regarding electronic access to official transcripts that were being
    presented to the Committees on Court Administration and Case Management
    and Judicial Resources, and then conveyed to those two committees its views
    on issues potentially affecting the Defender Services program.


COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL-STATE JURISDICTION

    LEGISLATION TO ELIMINATE
    FEDERAL COURT JURISDICTION

            The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction considered several bills
    pending in the 109th Congress that would eliminate federal court jurisdiction
    to hear certain constitutional claims. Noting the importance of preserving the
    rights of individuals to bring constitutional claims in Article III courts, and of
    protecting the independence of the judicial branch as a coordinate and coequal
    branch of government, the Committee recommended that the Judicial
    Conference strongly oppose legislation that would deprive a party of the
    opportunity to pursue claims under the U.S. Constitution in Article III courts.
    After discussing the potential breadth of the recommendation, the Conference
    recommitted it to the Committee for further consideration. (See also supra,
    “Miscellaneous Actions,” pp. 8-9).


    DECLARATION AND REMAND PROPOSAL

         As part of its ongoing jurisdictional improvements project, the
    Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction recommended that the Judicial


                                           23
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      Conference seek legislation to preserve state court jurisdiction in diversity
                      cases in which plaintiffs declare that they will forgo recovery in excess of the
                      threshold amount for federal court jurisdiction. In particular, the Committee
                      recommended, and the Conference approved, seeking legislation to —

                      a.   Amend section 1441(a) of title 28, United States Code, to provide that if
                           the plaintiff has filed a declaration in state court, as part of or in addition
                           to the initial pleading, to the effect that the plaintiff will neither seek nor
                           accept an award of damages or entry of other relief exceeding the amount
                           specified in section 1332(a) of title 28, the case shall not be removed on
                           the basis of the jurisdiction conferred in section 1332(a) of this title so
                           long as the plaintiff abides by the declaration and it remains binding
                           under state practice; and

                      b.   Amend section 1447 of title 28, United States Code, to (1) provide that
                           within 30 days after the filing of a notice of removal of a civil action in
                           which the district court’s removal jurisdiction rests solely on original
                           jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of title 28, the plaintiff may file a
                           declaration with the district court to the effect that the plaintiff will
                           neither seek nor accept an award of damages or entry of other relief
                           exceeding the amount specified in section 1332(a), and (2) authorize the
                           district court, upon the filing of such a declaration, to remand the action
                           to state court or retain the case in the interest of justice.

                      The first part of the proposal would preclude removal in those cases where the
                      plaintiff has filed a declaration in state court, if such declaration is permitted
                      by state practice, that the plaintiff will not seek or accept a recovery in excess
                      of the existing federal jurisdictional threshold (now $75,000). The second
                      part of the proposal would provide the federal court with discretion to remand
                      an action to state court on the basis of a declaration filed within 30 days of
                      removal, but would also allow the court to retain the case in the interest of
                      justice.


                      HABEAS CORPUS LEGISLATION

                              Legislation is pending in the 109th Congress (the “Streamlined
                      Procedures Act of 2005,” S. 1088 and H.R. 3035) that is intended to reform
                      federal habeas corpus review of state court convictions in both capital and
                      non-capital cases. In July 2005, letters were transmitted to both the House
                      and Senate Judiciary Committees expressing the judiciary’s opposition to
                      certain provisions of the bills based on existing positions of the Judicial
                      Conference. In late July 2005, the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted a
                      substitute amendment to S. 1088. The Committee on Federal-State


                                                              24
                                                                September 20, 2005

Jurisdiction (in consultation with the Committees on Criminal Law and
Defender Services) undertook a review of those provisions of S. 1088, as
amended in July 2005, and H.R. 3035 that had not been addressed in the
initial letters to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. The Committee
also examined the underlying premise of the proposed bills that there is
unreasonable delay in the resolution of habeas corpus petitions filed by state
prisoners in federal courts that requires remedial legislation. Based on its
review, the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference —

a.   Express support for the elimination of any unwarranted delay in the fair
     resolution of habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners in the federal
     courts;

b.   Urge that, before Congress considers additional amendments to habeas
     corpus procedures, analysis be undertaken to evaluate whether there is
     any unwarranted delay occurring in the application of current law in
     resolving habeas corpus petitions filed in federal courts by state prisoners
     and, if so, the causes for such delay;

c.   Express opposition to legislation regarding federal habeas corpus
     petitions filed by state prisoners that has the potential to (1) undermine
     the traditional role of the federal courts to hear and decide the merits of
     claims arising under the Constitution; (2) impede the ability of the federal
     and state courts to conduct an orderly review of constitutional claims,
     with appropriate deference to state-court proceedings; and (3) prevent the
     federal courts from reaching the merits of habeas corpus petitions by
     adding procedural requirements that may complicate the resolution of
     these cases and lead to protracted litigation, including the following
     sections of the proposed “Streamlined Procedures Act of 2005” in the
     109th Congress (H.R. 3035 as introduced and S. 1088 as amended in July
     2005):

       Section 2 of H.R. 3035 and S. 1088 (mixed petitions);
       Section 4 of H.R. 3035 and S. 1088 (procedurally defaulted claims);
       Section 5 of H.R. 3035 and S. 1088 (tolling of limitation period);
       Section 6 of H.R. 3035 (harmless errors in sentencing); and
       Section 9(a) of H.R. 3035 (federal review of capital cases under
       chapter 154 of title 28, United States Code);

d.   Express opposition to section 3 (amendments to petitions) of H.R. 3035
     and S. 1088 that would prohibit the federal courts from considering
     modifications to existing claims or the addition of new claims that meet
     the requirements of current law;

Judicial Conference of the United States

                      e.   Express opposition to section 7 of H.R. 3035 and section 6 of S. 1088
                           that would make the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
                           1996 (AEDPA) applicable to cases pending prior to its enactment, and
                           section 14 of H.R. 3035 and S. 1088 that would make the proposed
                           Streamlined Procedures Act applicable to pending cases; and

                      f.   Express opposition to the provision in section 11 of H.R. 3035 and
                           section 10 of S. 1088 that would amend 21 U.S.C. § 848(q) to require an
                           application for investigative, expert, or other services in connection with
                           challenges to a capital sentence involving state or federal prisoners to be
                           decided by a judge other than the judge presiding over the habeas corpus
                           proceeding.

                      The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction reported that it continued
                      to monitor the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) proposed changes to
                      the disability claims process, including proposed new regulations, and that a
                      letter commenting on those regulations was sent by the Director of the
                      Administrative Office (Director) to the Commissioner of the SSA. In
                      addition, the Committee asked the Director to convey to Congress the
                      judiciary’s opposition to a provision of the proposed “Federal Consent Decree
                      Fairness Act” (S. 489, H.R 1229, 109th Congress) that would require federal
                      district courts to rule on certain motions within 90 days. Such a provision is
                      inconsistent with the long-standing policy of the Conference opposing
                      statutory imposition of litigation priorities, expediting requirements, or time
                      limitations beyond those already specified in certain cases. The Committee
                      also reviewed asbestos legislation, and, at the Committee’s suggestion, a letter
                      was sent to Congress reiterating the Conference’s concern with provisions that
                      would limit the ability of any court to issue a stay in certain situations.


             COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Financial Disclosure reported that as of July 11,
                      2005, the Committee had received 3,634 financial disclosure reports and

   from magistrate judges; and 1,557 reports from judicial employees. The
   Committee also reported that the authority of the Judicial Conference to
   redact personal and sensitive information from financial disclosure reports
   will expire on December 31, 2005. The primary focus of the Committee's
   legislative effort for 2005 continues to be the repeal of this sunset provision
   (see supra, “Miscellaneous Actions,” pp. 8-9).


COMMITTEE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
   LONG RANGE PLAN FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 612 and on recommendation of the Committee
   on Information Technology, the Judicial Conference approved a 2006 update
   to the Long Range Plan for Information Technology in the Federal Judiciary.
   Funds for the judiciary’s information technology program will be spent in
   accordance with this plan.


   JUDICIARY NETWORK SECURITY AND PRIVACY REPORT

            Based on an independent security assessment of the judiciary’s data
   communications network (DCN), Case Management/Electronic Case Files
   system, and Lotus Notes, the Committee on Information Technology prepared
   a report and recommendations regarding judiciary network security and
   privacy, as well as an overall strategy for implementing the report. After
   soliciting input from the courts and revising the report where possible, the
   Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference approve the report and
   adopt its recommendations and direct the Committee on Information
   Technology to coordinate implementation of the recommendations. The
   Conference agreed.


   COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

           The Committee on Information Technology reported that it endorsed a
   revised approach to information technology training for judges to focus more
   specifically on judges’ tasks and functions and discussed various options.
   The Committee reaffirmed its commitment to cost containment, including
   identifying and implementing cost-effective service delivery models that take
   into consideration performance, service levels, security, and disaster recovery
   techniques. It agreed to permit access to the DCN by community defender
   organizations for administrative purposes and considered issues within its

                      and the Judicial Conference’s electronic transcript policy.


            COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that during the
                      period from January 1, 2005 to June 30, 2005, a total of 47 intercircuit
                      assignments, undertaken by 36 Article III judges, were processed and
                      recommended by the Committee and approved by the Chief Justice. In
                      addition, the Committee aided courts requesting assistance by both identifying
                      and obtaining judges willing to take assignments. The Committee received an
                      update of the Administrative Office’s effort to collect additional data on
                      visiting judge assignments (both intercircuit and intracircuit) to help evaluate
                      the costs and benefits of the intercircuit assignment program.


             COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL RELATIONS
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on International Judicial Relations reported
                      on its involvement in rule-of-law and judicial reform activities throughout the
                      world, highlighting those in Cambodia, Ecuador, Korea, Liberia, Mexico, and
                      the Russian Federation. The Committee continues to work closely on the rule-
                      of-law component of the Open World Program at the Library of Congress,
                      which has been expanded to bring Ukrainian as well as Russian jurists and
                      judicial officials to the United States.


            COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that its priority
                      attention is concentrated on the problem of the adequacy of judicial
                      compensation. This includes seeking vigorously to widen the circle of outside
                      supporters of improved compensation. While focusing upon that objective,
                      the Committee continues to consider other matters of relevance to the
                      judiciary within its jurisdiction, e.g., it is actively examining ways to improve
                      judicial-legislative communications.

COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES
    RESTRUCTURING THE NINTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT

            Along with the recommendations of the Committee on Court
    Administration and Case Management (see supra “Restructuring the Ninth
    Judicial Circuit,” pp. 14-15), the Conference considered and discussed
    recommendations of the Committee on Judicial Resources on proposals to
    restructure the Ninth Circuit. The Conference agreed to adopt, and to give
    prompt notice to Congress of, the following Committee recommendations:

    a.   The Conference opposes any legislation that would restructure the Ninth
         Circuit if, as with H.R. 211, H.R. 212, H.R. 3125, S. 1296, and S. 1301
         (109th Cong.), it would provide an inadequate level of judicial resources
         and an uncertain amount of appropriations to support the new circuit
         structures.

    b.   The Conference opposes efforts to condition legislative action regarding
         the establishment of new judgeships recommended by the Conference on
         the restructuring of judicial circuits.

    Since the Conference determined not to take a position either endorsing or
    opposing legislation providing for the split of the Ninth Circuit (see supra,
    pp. 14-15), it did not reach recommendations of the Committee regarding
    factors the Conference should consider were it to take such a position.


    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

             The salaries of circuit and court unit executives have been subject to a
    locality pay cap established by the Judicial Conference in September 1993 to
    match executive branch limits that are no longer applicable to the executive
    branch senior executive service (JCUS-SEP 93, p. 50). In order to provide
    relief to unit executives, especially those in high cost-of-living areas who have
    reached the pay cap and have had limited pay increases in the past few years,
    to help enhance recruitment and retention efforts in high cost-of-living areas,
    and to take a step toward re-establishing pay parity with the executive branch,
    the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference approve, as an
    interim measure pending completion of a comprehensive compensation study,
    the application of locality pay to circuit and court unit executive salaries up to
    the salary of a district judge, to be applied at the request of the chief judge on
    behalf of the court. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
    recommendation.

                      WORKFORCE RESHAPING

                              The judiciary has in place through 2005 a voluntary separation
                      incentive (buyout) program and a voluntary early retirement program for
                      Court Personnel System (CPS) employees, official court reporters, and federal
                      public defender organization employees (JCUS-SEP 03, pp. 27-28; JCUS-
                      SEP 04, pp. 7, 21-22). Noting the success of these programs both in
                      achieving savings for the judiciary and in facilitating organizational
                      restructuring in court offices, the Committee recommended that the Judicial
                      Conference offer both the buyout and early retirement programs through FY
                      2009, to be implemented each fiscal year at the discretion of the Director of
                      the Administrative Office. The Committee also recommended that, for the
                      early retirement program only, non-chambers Judiciary Salary Plan employees
                      be permitted to participate. CPS employees, official court reporters, and
                      federal public defender organization employees would continue to be included
                      in both programs. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendations.


                      TEMPORARY REPLACEMENTS FOR CHAMBERS STAFF

                              On recommendation of the Committee on Judicial Resources, the
                      Judicial Conference, with regard to the judiciary’s policy on centrally funded
                      temporary replacements for absent chambers staff, affirmed that (a) central
                      funding is generally limited to 20 weeks for maternity reasons, and 24 weeks
                      for medical reasons to care for a family member with a serious health
                      condition; (b) centrally funded temporary replacement is unlimited in cases
                      where the chambers employee is absent due to his or her own illness;
                      (c) appropriate medical documentation is required; and (d) the policy does not
                      cover swing pool secretaries.


                      WAIVER OF COURT REPORTER QUALIFICATIONS

                              Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 753(a), the Judicial Conference has
                      established minimum qualifications for official court reporters in federal
                      courts to ensure speed and accuracy needed to preserve reliable records of
                      court proceedings (see Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures,
                      Volume 6, Court Reporters Manual, Part 3.4.2.). Conference policy also
                      allows for waivers of these qualifications when a court demonstrates a good
                      faith effort to recruit a qualified reporter and when employment is
                      probationary until the qualifications requirements are fulfilled. Guide,
                      Volume 6, Part 3.4.4. Concerned that requests for waivers are increasing in

       frequency and that courts are not taking active steps to meet the qualification
       requirements, the Committee recommended amendments to the qualifications
       policy to stress the importance of maintaining court reporting skills at the
       minimum levels provided. The Committee recommended, and the Conference
       agreed to adopt, a qualifications waiver policy for official court reporters that
       (a) waivers may be granted for a period of one year;2 (b) a court’s request for
       a waiver must demonstrate a good faith effort to recruit a qualified reporter
       through a nationwide search; (c) a court reporter hired under a waiver must
       demonstrate that he or she has taken the scheduled certification tests required
       pursuant to Conference policy each time the tests have been offered, and has
       provided the test results to the respective court and the Administrative Office;
       (d) annual waivers may be authorized by the Administrative Office for a total
       of no more than three years, after which any continued request (including
       justification) would be made to the Committee; and (e) a court reporter not
       meeting the qualification requirements would be on probation during the
       waiver period until the requirements are fulfilled.


       TELEWORK FOR COURT REPORTERS

               Under an existing Judicial Conference guideline, court reporters who
       have been placed on a regular tour of duty and earn annual leave in
       accordance with the Leave Act (5 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq.) are required to serve
       their tour of duty “in the courthouse” (JCUS-SEP 83, p. 49). In order to allow
       court reporters to participate in the judiciary’s telework program, the Judicial
       Conference, on recommendation of the Committee, agreed to amend its
       September 1983 guideline to permit any such court reporter, if the court
       determines the reporter to be eligible for telework under the court’s telework
       program and has authorized the reporter to do so, to perform official duties
       outside the courthouse in a designated location approved by the court.


       COURT INTERPRETERS

               Based on established criteria, the Committee on Judicial Resources
       recommended that the Judicial Conference approve four additional Spanish
       staff court interpreter positions for fiscal year 2007, one for the District of
       Arizona, one for the District of Nebraska, and two for the District of New



2
 By mail ballot completed on November 30, 2005, the Executive Committee, acting
on behalf of the Conference, slightly modified this provision to provide that waivers
may be granted for a period of one year and one day, so that court reporters hired
under the waiver policy are eligible to receive benefits.

Judicial Conference of the United States

                      Mexico, based on the Spanish language interpreting workloads in these courts.
                      The Committee recommended that the Conference not approve additional
                      Spanish staff court interpreter positions for the Southern District of Iowa and
                      the District of New Jersey. The Committee further recommended that with
                      regard to the District of New Mexico’s request for a third additional Spanish
                      staff court interpreter position, the Conference should advise the District to
                      utilize the position currently providing Navajo language interpreting for
                      Spanish language interpreting in light of the decreased need for Navajo
                      language interpreting and the increased need for Spanish language
                      interpreting in that district. Finally, the Committee recommended accelerated
                      funding in fiscal year 2006 for one of the additional Spanish staff court
                      interpreter positions for the District of New Mexico. The Conference adopted
                      the Committee’s recommendations.


                      JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION

                              The Judicial Conference adopted a recommendation of the Committee
                      to raise the target grades of the following positions for the Judicial Panel on
                      Multiditrict Litigation: the executive attorney from Judiciary Salary Plan
                      (JSP)-16 to JSP-17, to bring that salary into conformity with the salary of
                      senior staff attorneys, and the clerk from JSP-15 to JSP-16 and chief deputy
                      clerk from JSP-14 to JSP-15, to reflect new classification criteria adopted in
                      2004 for clerks of district courts.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Judicial Resources reported that it endorsed a
                      report on the first phase of a study of court compensation and a revised plan
                      for further study, including advancing the component dealing with executive-
                      level compensation. A report will be presented to the Committee at its June
                      2006 meeting. Regarding access to work measurement data, the Committee
                      endorsed continuation of the current practice of strict confidentiality for
                      individual employees’ data, but decided to allow access by judiciary
                      personnel to aggregate data without the names of the courts. The Committee
                      reviewed a report and considered a proposal concerning electronic access to
                      official court transcripts and court reporter income. It also affirmed its strong
                      support for the Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS)
                      and the total funding requested for fiscal year 2006 for HRMIS as part of the
                      judiciary’s cost-containment and productivity initiatives.

OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGES SYSTEM

    RETIREMENT REGULATIONS

           As explained above (see “Retirement Regulations,” supra, p. 12),
    Section 6.03(e) of the Regulations of the Director Implementing the
    Retirement and Survivors’ Annuities for Bankruptcy Judges and Magistrates
    Act of 1988 is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. § 8440b(b)(7). The Committee on
    the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System, in parallel with the
    Bankruptcy Committee, recommended that the provision be deleted. The
    Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.

    judicial councils of the circuits, the Judicial Conference approved the
    following changes in positions, salaries, locations, and arrangements for full-

                      ACCELERATED FUNDING

                             On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to
                      designate the new full-time magistrate judge position at Las Cruces, New
                      Mexico, for accelerated funding in fiscal year 2006.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges
                      System reported that it is updating its 2001 report on the growth of the
                      magistrate judges system in response to a request from the Executive
                      Committee. The Committee also continued its cost-containment efforts,
                      recommending accelerated funding for only one of the three new magistrate
                      judge positions it is recommending to the Judicial Conference and agreeing
                      not to consider requests for new full-time magistrate judge positions at its
                      December 2005 meeting. The Committee discussed the issue of security for
                      judges and resolved that “full-time magistrate judges, part-time magistrate
                      judges, and recalled magistrate judges should be included in the spending
                      plan for funds appropriated in the FY 2005 Emergency Supplemental
                      Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami
                      Relief for increased judicial security outside of courthouse facilities,
                      including home intrusion detection systems for judges.”

                              The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                      Judicial Conference a proposed amendment to Appellate Rule 25 (Filing and
                      Service), and a proposed new Rule 32.1 (Citing Judicial Dispositions),
                      together with Committee notes explaining their purpose and intent. The
                      Conference approved the amendment to Rule 25, and after discussion,
                      approved new Rule 32.1 with the stipulation that it apply only to judicial

                      that they be adopted by the Court and transmitted to Congress in accordance
                      with the law.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure reported that, in
                      preparation for implementation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
                      Consumer Protection Act of 2005, many of whose provisions would become
                      effective on October 17, 2005, it recommended a package of proposed interim
                      bankruptcy rules for adoption through standing or general orders by the
                      courts, as well as new official forms. In light of the time constraint, the
                      Executive Committee acted on behalf of the Judicial Conference to approve
                      the forms and authorize distribution of the interim bankruptcy rules to the
                      courts (see supra, “New Bankruptcy Legislation,” p. 5). The Committee
                      expects to publish for public comment no later than August 2006 proposed
                      new and amended Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure based substantially
                      on the interim rules, modified, as appropriate, after considering comments

    from the bench and bar reflecting the use of the interim rules, as well as any
    additional revisions to the official forms.


COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND FACILITIES
    U.S. COURTS DESIGN GUIDE

            Phase I Revisions. In accordance with the integrated cost-containment
    strategy approved by the Judicial Conference in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP
    04, pp. 6-7), the Committee on Security and Facilities has been conducting a
    comprehensive review of the U.S. Courts Design Guide to assess the validity
    of current design standards for new courthouses and to identify revisions that
    would control costs without affecting functionality. After soliciting
    suggestions and comments from judges, court unit executives, and other
    interested parties, and obtaining the views of seven other Conference
    committees, the Committee completed Phase I of the review by
    recommending that the Conference endorse 18 Design Guide revisions for
    chambers suites and court office space. Following discussion, the Conference
    endorsed 10 of the proposed revisions and recommitted the other 8 proposals
    to the Committee for further consideration.

            Exceptions to the U.S. Courts Design Guide. As stated in a policy
    adopted by the Judicial Conference in March 1999 (JCUS-MAR 99, p. 35),
    the authority to approve exceptions to the Design Guide lies generally with
    the circuit judicial councils. As part of its comprehensive review of the
    Design Guide, the Committee recommended that this policy be revised to
    provide that, while the circuit judicial council has the authority and
    responsibility for a circuit’s space management program (see 28 U.S.C.
    § 462(b)), the authority to approve the following exceptions to the Design
    Guide should rest with the Judicial Conference: (a) exceeding the total space
    “envelope” for either the court unit or project as a whole; (b) changing the
    standard configurations for judges’ chambers; and (c) changing the plumbing
    standard for an office. Authority to approve exceptions to exceed the
    recommended office space standards within the total envelope of space for the
    court unit would remain with the circuit judicial councils. The Conference
    adopted the recommendation with a modification that once a circuit judicial
    council has endorsed one of the exceptions itemized above, authority to grant
    that exception would rest with the Committee on Space and Facilities unless
    the Committee disagreed with the circuit judicial council, in which case the
    Judicial Conference would decide whether to grant the exception. Finally, on
    recommendation of the Committee, the Conference rescinded its
    September/October 2001 policy (JCUS-SEP/OCT 01, p. 71), which



                                           39
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      substituted the term “special requirements” for the term departures (also
                      referred to as exceptions, deviations, and waivers) in the Design Guide.


                      INDEPENDENT REAL PROPERTY AUTHORITY

                              In September 1989, the Judicial Conference endorsed seeking
                      legislation to provide the judicial branch with independent authority to
                      manage, acquire, construct, maintain, and dispose of its own real property
                      (JCUS-SEP 89, p. 81). Citing increasing concern with regard to escalating
                      rent payments to the General Services Administration (GSA) and lack of
                      progress in obtaining rent reductions from GSA, the Committee on Security
                      and Facilities recommended that the Conference reaffirm support for
                      legislation to establish independent real property authority for the judiciary
                      separate from GSA. After discussion, the Conference determined to recommit
                      the matter so that the Committee on Space and Facilities, acting in
                      consultation with the Committee on the Budget, could develop and submit to
                      the Conference a detailed plan illustrating how independent real property
                      authority could be implemented.


                      RENT AS A SEPARATE APPROPRIATION

                              Space rent was a separate appropriation prior to FY 1987, when it was
                      merged into the Salaries and Expenses account. In December 2004, the
                      Committee on Security and Facilities adopted a resolution recommending that
                      rent again be sought as a separate appropriation and forwarded the resolution
                      to the Budget Committee for its consideration. The Budget Committee
                      expressed a preference for pursuing administrative rather than legislative
                      remedies at that time. Noting that pursuit of rent as a separate appropriation
                      could provide rental relief for the judiciary in the long term, the Committee
                      asked the Judicial Conference to refer the resolution to the Committee on the
                      Budget for its reconsideration. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendation.


                      COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION PLAN

                              In advance of the March 2005 Conference session, the Committee
                      recommended a courthouse construction project plan through which the
                      judiciary would request fiscal year 2007 funding for seven courthouse
                      projects. The Committee’s recommendation was deferred to the September
                      2005 Judicial Conference to give the Budget Committee an opportunity to
                      make recommendations to the Security and Facilities Committee and the


                                                            40
                                                                        September 20, 2005

       Executive Committee regarding the affordability of pending courthouse
       construction projects not yet approved for construction funding by the
       Conference (JCUS-MAR 05, p. 8). The Security and Facilities Committee
       subsequently reaffirmed its support for the FY 2007 project plan, expanded to
       include two projects suggested by GSA. The Budget Committee
       recommended that, except for projects deemed a judicial space emergency, all
       funding requests for new construction projects should be deferred until at least
       the March 2006 Conference session. Following discussion of the two
       committees’ views, the Conference agreed to seek FY 2007 funding for the
       pending courthouse projects in Buffalo, New York; Salt Lake City, Utah;
       Jackson, Mississippi; Fort Pierce, Florida; and Savannah, Georgia,3 and it
       deferred action on other projects until March 2006.


       BUILDING MANAGEMENT DELEGATION PROGRAM

               In March 1988, the Judicial Conference approved a pilot program in
       which courts could assume responsibility for managing their courthouses
       under a delegation of authority from the General Services Administration
       (JCUS-MAR 88, p. 40). Courts in Birmingham, Alabama, and Miami and
       West Palm Beach, Florida, assumed responsibilities for court facilities under
       this program. Following recent changes to the program instituted by GSA, the
       judiciary sought an independent review of the program. Based on that review,
       the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference (a) end the
       judiciary’s participation in the building management delegation program, and
       (b) develop a transition plan to return to GSA the operation and management
       of the court facilities within the Southern District of Florida and the Northern
       District of Alabama. The Conference adopted both recommendations.


       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

               The Committee on Security and Facilities reported that it discussed
       and continues to pursue several cost-containment initiatives, including a
       comprehensive reevaluation of the long-range facilities planning process, a
       review of existing criteria for closure of non-resident court facilities, and an
       effort to reduce Federal Protective Service (FPS) costs for contract guard
       services. After the Congress provided $11.9 million as an emergency
       supplemental appropriation to improve off-site security for the judiciary, the



3
 These five projects were specifically excluded from the 2-year moratorium on
planning, authorizing, and budgeting for courthouse construction projects imposed by
the Conference in September 2004 (see JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 34-35).

                      Committee resolved to develop an agreement between the Administrative
                      Office and the Department of Justice regarding use of the supplemental
                      funding to provide up to $4,000 per judge for the purchase of home intrusion
                      detection systems for all federal judges.


             FUNDING
                              All of the foregoing recommendations that require the expenditure of
                      funds for implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to
                      the availability of funds and to whatever priorities the Conference might
                      establish for the use of available resources.
