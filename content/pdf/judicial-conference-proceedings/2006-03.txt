                                   The Judicial Conference of the United States recognizes
                               with appreciation, admiration and respect

                                             LEONIDAS RALPH MECHAM
                                            Director of the Administrative Office
                                                         1985 - 2006

                                    Director Leonidas Ralph Mecham has served under three
                               Chief Justices and for more than 20 years as the Administrative
                               Officeโs Director, earning him the distinction of serving longer
                               than any previous Director in the agencyโs history. Under
                               Ralph Mechamโs stewardship, the federal court system has
                               flourished.

                                   Ralph Mecham has focused on enhancing support to the
                               Judicial Conference and its committees, building relationships,

       and providing excellent services to judges and the courts. He
       has also promoted effectiveness and achievement in all
       judiciary programs. Ralph Mechamโs acumen for legislative
       affairs greatly strengthened the judiciaryโs ability to
       communicate its budgetary and legislative needs to Congress
       and the executive branch. His success in securing adequate
       resources for the judiciary in tight budgetary climates enabled
       federal courts to maintain high standards of service to the
       public while carrying out the judiciaryโs critical mission. He
       tirelessly pursued increases in judgesโ and court executivesโ
       pay and enhancements of benefits to ensure that the federal
       judiciary can recruit and retain the best people. He created a
       program that enabled the judiciary to obtain funding for new
       courthouses to replace aging, unsafe facilities, and he pushed
       to enhance judicial security.

            Ralph Mecham has endeavored to reach out across the
       judicial family to build strong relationships and seek broad
       input. He championed innovations that have revolutionized
       court administration. His initiative to decentralize financial
       and management responsibilities to the courts provided judges
       and court managers with the flexibility they needed to address
       their unique requirements and priorities, and enhanced
       accountability and effectiveness. Recognizing early the
       potential benefits of new technologies, he transformed court
       operations through the deployment of a data communications
       network and numerous systems.

            Ralph Mechamโs visionary leadership, deep devotion
       to the independence and integrity of the federal judiciary,
       and unflagging spirit, drive and determination have left an
       enduring legacy for federal judicial administration. A man of
       remarkable intelligence and good humor, he has inspired others
       to accomplish a great deal, as well. The Judicial Conference
       expresses its deep gratitude to Ralph Mecham for his record of
       excellent and dedicated service to the federal judiciary, and it
       wishes the best to him and his warm and gracious wife,
       Barbara, as they enter this new stage of their lives.

      In separate resolutions (which are reprinted in the Appendix), several
committees of the Judicial Conference paid tribute to the dedicated and
accomplished service to the judiciary of Director Mecham. Also set forth in

             EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
                     CIRCUIT JUDICIAL CONFERENCES

                             In March 2005 the Judicial Conference, in an effort to contain costs,
                     approved a policy that would limit the use of the judiciaryโs appropriations to
                     cover the non-travel related expenses associated with circuit judicial
                     conferences by authorizing such use only in alternate years (JCUS-MAR 05,
                     p. 5). Implementation of the policy was subsequently deferred so that possible
                     changes could be considered to address practical issues that had been brought
                     to the Executive Committeeโs attention (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 9). The Committee
                     then considered an alternative policy that would allow the use for circuit
                     conferences of appropriated funds, both centrally held and decentralized, to the
                     extent otherwise permissible, with centrally held funding to be allotted in
                     amounts that would be established biennially, but could be distributed either in
                     alternate years or in separate allotments for each of two successive years. On
                     recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference modified its
                     previous policy with regard to funding for circuit judicial conferences and
                     agreed toโ

                     a.       Encourage the circuits to use non-appropriated funds (e.g., attorney
                              admission fees and conference registration fees), to the extent advisable
                              and permissible, to pay the expenses (other than the travel costs of
                              judiciary personnel) for all circuit conferences in which the bar
                              participates;

                     b.       Direct the Administrative Office, subject to approval by the Executive
                              Committee, to establish and periodically adjust a biennial per capita
                              rate at which centrally held appropriated funds will be made available
                              to pay circuit conference expenses (apart from the travel costs of
                              judiciary personnel) during fiscal years 2007 and 2008, and during
                              ensuing two-year periods; and




                                                              6
                                                                  March 14, 2006

c.   Authorize the Administrative Office to provide such funding to the
     circuits for such expenses in single allotments available in alternate
     years or, if a particular circuit requests, in annual allotments that may
     not, in the aggregate, exceed the biennial funding amount available to
     that circuit in accordance with the per-capita rate established for that
     period.

             COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
                         COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                 The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that, following
                         an exhaustive examination of the judiciaryโs oversight and review system
                         (including local, circuit, and national roles, responsibilities, and mechanisms
                         for review), it concluded that the system is effective and that the AOโs
                         activities in this regard are carried out properly and well. The Committee also
                         proposed, and the Executive Committee approved, modification to the
                         Committeeโs jurisdictional statement to reflect expressly its ongoing
                         responsibility to oversee the audit, review, and investigative assistance
                         activities of the Administrative Office (see supra, โMiscellaneous Actions,โ
                         pp. 7-8). In addition, the Committee determined to establish a recognition
                         program, named in honor of outgoing Director Mecham, by which the
                         Committee will acknowledge AO employees for noteworthy achievements in
                         providing support to the courts.

COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

   CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELING/DEBTOR EDUCATION
   PROGRAMS

           Interim Guidelines. On recommendation of the Committee on the
   Administration of the Bankruptcy System, the Judicial Conference approved
   revisions to the interim guidelines for certification of credit counseling
   agencies and debtor education programs in bankruptcy administrator districts,
   which had been adopted to implement the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
   Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The revisions include changes to the
   structure and extent of the bonding requirement for counseling agencies, a
   more extensive requirement for disclosure of relationships between counseling
   agencies and other businesses, and a requirement for documentary proof of
   non-profit status. The Conference also adopted a recommendation of the
   Committee to delegate to the Director of the Administrative Office authority to
   amend the interim guidelines as necessary to conform to similar guidelines for
   the United States trustee program, as adopted and amended from time to time
   by the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees.

         Bankruptcy Administrator Guidelines. On recommendation of the
   Committee, the Conference amended the Guidelines of the Director of the
   Administrative Office of the United States Courts Relating to the
   Administration of the Bankruptcy Administrator Program toโ

   a.     Require that approved applications of consumer credit counseling
          agencies and debtor education providers be retained until the expiration
          of the applicable statute of limitations on criminal misrepresentations
          and that rejected applications be retained until expiration of the statute
          of limitations on suits against the government; and

   b.     Limit chapter 13 trustees to providing debtor education courses only to
          chapter 13 debtors.


   SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT REGULATIONS

           Section 2.01 of the Judicial Conference Regulations for the Selection,
   Appointment and Reappointment of United States Bankruptcy Judges requires
   that public notice of a bankruptcy judgeship vacancy be published in a โgeneral

                                          9
Judicial Conference of the United States

                     local newspaper or similar publication and in a bar journal, newsletter, or local
                     legal periodical, if available,โ in order to ensure broad dissemination of the
                     public notice and attract qualified applicants. Noting that the cost of
                     newspaper advertisements continues to escalate and that internet employment
                     sites not only provide far-reaching public access, but also are generally offered
                     free of charge or at low cost, the Committee recommended, and the Conference
                     approved, an amendment to section 2.01 to make publication of judicial
                     vacancy announcements through print advertisements in local newspapers
                     optional, rather than required, and to permit electronic publication of those
                     announcements.


                     OFFICIAL DUTY STATION

                             On recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee, and in accordance
                     with 28 U.S.C. ยง 152(b)(1), the Judicial Conference approved Bakersfield as
                     the official duty station for the new bankruptcy judgeship in the Eastern
                     District of California, as requested by the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council.


                     COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                            The Bankruptcy Committee reported that it adopted a resolution
                     commending the judges and employees of the bankruptcy courts for their
                     extraordinary efforts in implementing the new bankruptcy legislation. It also
                     commented on a report on the Administrative Officeโs study of administrative
                     services, and it provided suggestions to the Committee on Information
                     Technology on strategies to help meet the technology needs of judges. The
                     Committee further suggested certain fee amendments made necessary by the
                     new bankruptcy legislation and received reports on a wide variety of topics,
                     including an analysis showing that the benefits of the bankruptcy judge recall
                     program significantly outweigh the costs.


             COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
                      BUDGET CAPS FOR SPACE RENTAL COSTS

                             In furtherance of the judiciaryโs efforts to contain space rental costs,
                      the Budget Committee recommended, and the Judicial Conference approved
                      in concept, the establishment of an annual budget cap for space rental costs to


                                                            10

be determined by the Budget Committee in consultation with the Space and
Facilities Committee. The rent budget cap would apply to all future rent
requirements, including but not limited to new courthouses, repair and
alteration projects, and additional space acquisitions.


FISCAL YEAR 2006 APPROPRIATIONS

        Noting the adverse effects on the judiciary of across-the-board funding
cuts in FY 2004 and 2005, and that a third year of such cuts would severely
jeopardize the judiciaryโs ability to perform its constitutional duties,
the Judicial Conference, in November 2005, approved by mail ballot a
resolution recommended by the Budget Committee urging Congress and the
President to exempt the judiciary from any across-the-board cuts to its fiscal
year 2006 appropriations and to provide funding at least at the level contained
in the judiciary's appeal to congressional conferees.


COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

        The Committee on the Budget reported that it discussed a number of
issues aimed at reducing the judiciaryโs General Services Administration
(GSA) rent requirements since rent paid to GSA continues to consume over
20 percent of the judiciaryโs Salaries and Expenses account budget. In
addition, at the request of the Judicial Conference (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 40), it
reconsidered a proposal to seek a separate appropriation to cover GSA rental
charges and determined that a separate appropriation for rent would not be in
the best interest of the judiciary. The Committee also discussed the
judiciaryโs long-range budget outlook, efforts to acquire additional resources
from Congress, and the program committeesโ progress on the Judicial
Conference-approved cost-containment strategy (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 6-7),
including studies of administrative services and alternative service delivery
models for information technology.

                      on conflicts of interest, outside activities, and other ethical issues. It also
                      advised the Conference that since its last report to the Conference in
                      September 2005, the Committee received 29 new written inquiries and issued
                      28 written advisory responses (one inquiry was withdrawn). During this
                      period, the average response time for requests was 15 days. The Chairman
                      received and responded to 41 informal inquiries, and the other Committee
                      members responded individually to 130 informal inquiries from their

             COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
             AND CASE MANAGEMENT

                      MISCELLANEOUS FEES

                               Electronic Public Access Fee Schedule. On recommendation of the
                      Committee on Court Administration and Case Management, the Conference
                      amended the Electronic Public Access (EPA) Fee Schedule to add a 50-cent-
                      per-page fee for the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER)
                      Service Center to reproduce, on paper, records pertaining to a PACER
                      account, and a $45 fee for a check paid to the PACER Service Center that is
                      returned for lack of funds. Similar fees are already included in the appellate,
                      district, and bankruptcy miscellaneous fee schedules. The fee for reproducing
                      records only applies to services rendered on behalf of the United States if the
                      record or paper relates to the requesterโs account and is remotely available
                      through electronic access. Also on the Committeeโs recommendation, the
                      Conference increased the EPA fee for a search of court records conducted by
                      PACER Service Center staff from $20 to $26, the fee currently charged for
                      searches done by clerkโs office staff, and clarified that this fee applies per
                      name or item searched.

                             Court of Appeals Miscellaneous Fee Schedule. The Bankruptcy
                      Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 establishes a
                      procedure for direct bankruptcy appeals to the courts of appeals in specific
                      circumstances. Under interim rules developed to facilitate uniform practice

                                                            12
                                                                    March 14, 2006

under the new Act,1 litigants are required to pay a $250 filing fee, set forth in
Item 15 of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule, before a direct
appeal can be certified to the court of appeals. However, Item I of the Court
of Appeals Miscellaneous Fee Schedule requires a $250 filing fee when an
appeal is authorized to proceed in the court of appeals. Noting that the
imposition of two $250 filing fees to file a single appeal was probably
unintended and would be unjust, the Committee recommended, and the
Conference agreed, that Item I of the Court of Appeals Miscellaneous Fee
Schedule be amended by adding the following sentence at the end of the
existing language:

       A docketing fee shall not be charged for the docketing of a
       direct bankruptcy appeal when the fee has been collected by the
       bankruptcy court in accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 1930n.
       (Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule, Item 15).

        Waiver of Miscellaneous Fees in Emergencies. In September 1997,
the Judicial Conference delegated authority to the Director of the
Administrative Office to grant waivers of miscellaneous fees, excluding filing
fees, following a natural disaster, for a set period of time not to exceed one
year, upon the request of the chief judge of the affected court (JCUS-SEP 97,
pp. 60-61). Noting that this policy would not cover man-made events such as
terrorist attacks, which could have the same or greater destructive impact as
natural disasters, and that recent legislation permitting courts to hold
proceedings outside of their geographic boundaries in times of emergency
applies under all emergency conditions, the Committee recommended, and the
Conference agreed, that the delegation of authority to the Director to waive
fees in times of natural disasters should be amended to read as follows:

       Authority is delegated to the Director of the Administrative
       Office to grant waivers of certain and specified miscellaneous
       fees, excluding filing fees, when emergency conditions are
       present, for a set period of time not to exceed one year, upon
       the request of the chief judge, or, if the chief judge is not
       available, the most senior active judge of the affected court.

 The Executive Committee, in August 2005, acted on behalf of the Conference
to authorize distribution of proposed interim rules for adoption in individual
districts by local rule or general order, to be used until the Federal Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure could be amended to reflect the new legislation (JCUS-
SEP 05, p. 5).

Judicial Conference of the United States

                              Bankruptcy Miscellaneous Fee Schedule. The Deficit Reduction Act
                      of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-171) increases the filing fees for appellate, civil, and
                      bankruptcy cases, effective April 9, 2006. These legislative fee increases
                      would affect several fees on the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee
                      Schedule, promulgated by the Judicial Conference, that are linked to the filing
                      fees. Since the Judicial Conference has increased nearly all of the
                      miscellaneous fees in recent years, and the judiciary has not had an
                      opportunity to review the appropriateness of these automatic increases, the
                      Committee, in consultation with the Bankruptcy Committee, recommended
                      that the Judicial Conference stay implementation of the automatic increases in
                      order to provide time for the Court Administration and Case Management
                      Committee and the Bankruptcy Committee to review and analyze their merits.
                      The Conference adopted the Committeeโs recommendation.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                      reported that it discussed several issues, including legislative efforts to split
                      the Ninth Circuit, implementation of the policy on electronic availability of
                      transcripts of courts proceedings, the work of its privacy subcommittee, and a
                      follow-up study conducted by the Federal Judicial Center on implementation
                      of the privacy policy. The Committee considered a number of other
                      significant legislative proposals, including a proposal to establish a pilot
                      program that would assign patent cases only to judges who have been
                      designated to hear them, and several proposals relating to cameras in the
                      courtroom. The Committee also discussed the efforts of its library
                      subcommittee to reduce future spending, develop financial plans for
                      lawbooks, modify the list of lawbook material available to newly appointed
                      judges, and review library sizes and types of spaces to determine if reductions
                      could be made.


             COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAW
                      PRESENTENCE INVESTIGATION REPORT MONOGRAPH

                             On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, the Judicial
                      Conference approved revisions to the Presentence Investigation Report for
                      Defendants Sentenced Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Publication
                      107, and a new AO Form 246, for publication and distribution to the courts.

    The revisions (a) incorporate changes prompted by the recent Supreme Court
    decision on sentencing in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),
    (b) provide guidance to judges on ordering modified presentence investigation
    reports in appropriate cases, and (c) restyle and reorganize the monograph to
    facilitate its use as a training and reference document. New AO Form 246
    was developed to assist the courts in ordering specific presentence
    investigations and reports.


    AUTHORITY TO MODIFY MONOGRAPHS

            In order to expedite the implementation of technical, conforming, and
    non-controversial amendments to monographs prepared for use by the
    probation and pretrial services system, the Committee on Criminal Law
    recommended that the Judicial Conference delegate to the Committee the
    authority to approve such changes for existing and future monographs, for
    publication and distribution to the courts. The Conference adopted the
    Committeeโs recommendation.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Criminal Law reported that, in light of the success
    of the 2005 National Sentencing Policy Institute, it asked the Federal Judicial
    Center to convene a National Sentencing Policy Institute during 2006, to
    focus upon the effects of United States v. Booker and to provide a forum for
    discussing federal sentencing policy. The Committee also determined to
    advise the Executive Committee that there is no compelling reason to transfer
    the post-conviction supervision function to an agency outside of the judiciary,
    and furthermore that such a transfer would be detrimental and
    counterproductive.


COMMITTEE ON DEFENDER SERVICES

          Reduction Procedures for CJA Panel Attorney Claims. On
    recommendation of the Committee on Defender Services, the Judicial
    Conference amended paragraph 2.22D of the Guidelines for the
    Administration of the Criminal Justice Act and Related Statutes, Volume 7,

Judicial Conference of the United States

                      Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, to state that courts should
                      provide appointed counsel in CJA representations with prior notice of
                      proposed reductions to CJA vouchers (other than for reductions related to
                      mathematical or technical errors), a brief statement of reasons for proposed
                      reductions, and an opportunity to address the judgeโs concerns. The
                      amendment explicitly endorses informality and flexibility in both
                      communication of the notice and in the resolution of any objection by
                      counsel; no hearing, formal or otherwise, is required. This change is not
                      intended to confer a right to obtain review of the judgeโs decision.

                             Voucher Reductions in Constrained Budgetary Environments. Noting
                      that some judges may delay action on CJA vouchers or reduce the amount of
                      compensation awarded in response to constrained budgetary circumstances,
                      and that appropriations issues should not be resolved at the expense of
                      individual attorneys, the Committee recommended that the Conference
                      approve a new paragraph 2.22D of the CJA Guidelines to advise judges not to
                      delay or reduce vouchers for the purpose of diminishing Defender Services
                      program costs, and redesignate current paragraphs 2.22D (as amended above)
                      through F as 2.22E through G, respectively. The Conference approved the
                      Committeeโs recommendation.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Defender Services reported that to advance its cost-
                      containment efforts, it formulated plans for soliciting circuit interest in
                      participating in a pilot project, approved by the Judicial Conference at its
                      September 2005 session (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 21), under which the Defender
                      Services appropriation will fund three circuit positions for up to three years to
                      support the case-budgeting process. In addition, after considering a report on
                      federal defender organizations that had been affected by catastrophic
                      hurricanes in 2005 and noting problems encountered (such as locating
                      displaced clients and communicating with staff and other parts of the
                      judiciary, including the Administrative Office), the Committee requested that
                      the Administrative Office collect defender organizationsโ continuity of
                      operations and communications plans and that action be taken to initiate or
                      update them.

COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL-STATE JURISDICTION
    AMENDMENTS TO THE VENUE STATUTES

           As part of its jurisdictional improvements project, the Committee on
    Federal-State Jurisdiction recommended that the Judicial Conference adopt
    amendments to title 28 of the United States Code to clarify and improve the
    venue statutes. The Conference approved the recommended amendments as
    follows:

    a.     Add a new 28 U.S.C. ยง 1390 to define the terms and scope of the
           general venue provisions to be set forth in ยง 1391;

    b.     Amend 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 toโ

           1.     establish a single venue standard for both federal question and
                  diversity of citizenship jurisdiction, to apply unless venue is
                  otherwise specified by a federal statute, and to provide that
                  โfallback venue,โ i.e., venue when there is no other district in
                  which the action may be brought, is proper in a judicial district
                  in which any defendant is subject to the courtโs personal
                  jurisdiction as to the action in question;

           2.     clarify that residence for a natural person means the judicial
                  district in which that person is domiciled;

           3.     establish venue without regard to the local or transitory nature
                  of the action;

           4.     extend the rules governing corporate venue to any
                  unincorporated associations that enjoy capacity to sue and be
                  sued under applicable law; and

           5.     limit venue in multiple defendant cases to a district of the state
                  in which all defendants reside; and

    c.     Repeal 28 U.S.C. ยง 1392, which established a separate rule for local
           actions.

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction reported on the status of
                      the Social Security Administrationโs proposed changes to the disability claims
                      process. The Committee also considered immigration reform legislation
                      pending in the 109th Congress and discussed recent changes in the
                      administrative review of immigration cases by the Board of Immigration
                      Appeals and the impact of those changes on the workload of the courts of
                      appeals. The Committee was provided an update on habeas corpus legislation
                      pending in Congress and addressed the need for the federal courts to review
                      the processing of capital habeas corpus petitions filed in the federal courts by
                      state prisoners to determine whether there are any unwarranted delays, and if
                      so, the causes of such delays. Members also participated in a roundtable
                      discussion of ways the Committee may be of assistance to the federal and
                      state courts on issues of mutual concern.


             COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Financial Disclosure reported that as of December
                      31, 2005, the Committee had received 4,084 financial disclosure reports and
                      certifications for calendar year 2004, including 1,344 reports and
                      certifications from Supreme Court justices, Article III judges, and judicial
                      officers of special courts; 357 reports from bankruptcy judges; 563 reports
                      from magistrate judges; and 1,820 reports from judicial employees. The
                      Committee reported that the authority of the Judicial Conference to redact
                      personal and sensitive information from financial disclosure reports expired
                      on December 31, 2005. The primary focus of legislative efforts in this area
                      for 2006 is restoration of the judiciary's redaction authority.


             COMMITTEE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Information Technology reported that it reviewed
                      efforts underway to encourage judges to use technology, resolved that remote
                      access technologiesโsuch as high-speed access to the internet and personal
                      digital assistantsโcan be of great benefit for judgesโ security and efficiency,

    indicated support for courts making these technologies available to judges,
    and requested that the Administrative Office seek funds for this purpose. The
    Committee continued to monitor cost-containment efforts to identify and
    implement cost-effective information technology service delivery models. It
    also provided comments on a study of administrative services, cautioning that
    confidentiality, security, quality of service, reliability, and potential impact on
    the judiciaryโs information technology infrastructure should be considered as
    decisions are made regarding the delivery of administrative services.


COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that, during
    calendar year 2005, a total of 129 intercircuit assignments were undertaken by
    66 Article III judges. In addition, the Committee received an update on the
    Administrative Officeโs effort to collect additional information on visiting
    judge assignments (both intercircuit and intracircuit) to help evaluate the costs
    and benefits of the program. The Committeeโs view, based on fiscal year
    2005 data, was that the benefits of the visiting judge program clearly
    outweigh its costs. The Judicial Resources Committee concurred with this
    conclusion, and the Executive Committee was advised of these results. The
    Committee also reported that it would continue to promote the effective use of
    visiting judges.


COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL RELATIONS
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on International Judicial Relations reported on its
    involvement in rule-of-law and judicial reform activities throughout the
    world, highlighting those in Albania, Indonesia, Montenegro, and the Russian
    Federation. The Committee also reported on its ongoing involvement with the
    rule-of-law component of the Open World Program at the Library of
    Congress, which brings Russian and Ukrainian jurists and judicial officials to
    the United States.

            COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
                      ROTH 401(K)-TYPE PLAN

                              The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001
                      (Pub. L. No. 107-16) authorizes employers in the private and non-profit
                      sectors to offer their employees the opportunity to make Roth 401(k)
                      contributions beginning January 1, 2006. This legislation does not cover
                      federal employees. Roth 401(k) plans differ from traditional 401(k)-type
                      plans, such as the federal employeesโ Thrift Savings Plan, in that
                      contributions are taxable at the time of the contribution but the proceeds, plus
                      any earnings, are completely free from federal tax at the time of distribution.
                      On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to ask the
                      Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to seek legislation that would
                      authorize the establishment of a Roth 401(k)-type option for Thrift Savings
                      Plan participants.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that it has continued to
                      devote its priority attention to the problem of judicial compensation. In view
                      of the upward spiral in the salaries of law firm associates, the Committee
                      questioned whether federal judgesโ salaries bear a reasonable relationship to
                      those of the pool of lawyers from which candidates for judicial office are
                      typically drawn. At its December 2005 meeting, the Committee devoted
                      considerable time and attention to the discussion of benefits matters, including
                      the Judicial Survivorsโ Annuities System.


             COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Judicial Resources reported that it endorsed
                      extending the time line for the court compensation study in order to afford
                      greater involvement of judges, unit executives, and employees. After much
                      discussion, the Committee resolved to create an ad hoc subcommittee to study
                      all facets of law clerk recruitment, including electronic tools to assist in the
                      application and selection process. The Committee determined that the work
                      measurement study of pro se law clerks in the district courts that had been

    scheduled to begin in spring 2006 should be postponed until more information
    on the use of these law clerks is obtained. The Committee endorsed an
    interim policy to allow court and federal public defender organization
    employees to participate in any emergency leave transfer program authorized
    by the President, once appropriate legislative authority is enacted to include
    the judicial branch.


COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL SECURITY
    U.S. BUREAU OF PRISONS MAIL SCREENING

            In the wake of two recent incidents involving the delivery of a
    suspicious package from a U.S. Penitentiary to a clerk of courtโs office, the
    Committee on Judicial Security recommended that all outgoing mail to judges
    from inmates incarcerated at maximum security facilities be screened. After
    discussing and slightly modifying the recommendation, the Conference agreed
    to urge the Bureau of Prisons (which had recently instituted an interim
    screening procedure and was in the process of considering long-term
    measures) to adopt a policy that requires the screening, without reading, of all
    outgoing mail to federal judges and courts from inmates incarcerated in a U.S.
    Penitentiary or high-security Federal Correctional Institution.


    SECURITY AT LEASED PROBATION AND
    PRETRIAL SERVICES OFFICES

           On recommendation of the Committee, which noted the security risks
    faced by probation and pretrial services officers in leased space, the Judicial
    Conference adopted a policy authorizing the placement of security screening
    equipment and contract security guards at leased facilities that house
    probation or pretrial services offices.


    IN-SERVICE TRAINING FOR DEPUTY U.S. MARSHALS

            Expressing concern about the adequacy of training for deputy U.S.
    marshals, the Committee on Judicial Security recommended that the Judicial
    Conference urge the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to provide
    regular, formal, in-service training to deputy U.S. marshals as a priority in, at
    a minimum, the following areas: (a) how to conduct a residential security

                      survey; and (b) how to provide an effective protective security detail. The
                      Conference agreed to the Committeeโs recommendation.


                      JUDICIAL PERSONNEL PROFILES

                              The USMS maintains Judicial Personnel Profiles, which contain
                      personal information about judges and their families that may be needed in an
                      emergency. The Judicial Conference agreed, on recommendation of the
                      Committee, to encourage judges to complete the Judicial Personnel Profile
                      upon taking office and to periodically update this information as requested by
                      the USMS. To address concerns about the confidentiality of the judgesโ
                      personal information, on recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
                      also agreed to request that the USMS take appropriate measures to ensure the
                      security of the information contained in judgesโ Judicial Personnel Profiles.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Judicial Security reported that it discussed the court
                      security officer (CSO) program and the re-evaluation of the CSO staffing
                      formula as a cost-containment issue. The Committee determined that, prior to
                      re-evaluating the formula, it is necessary to conduct a thorough review of the
                      CSO contract. In considering charges to the judiciary for security provided at
                      court locations by the Federal Protective Service (FPS), the Committee
                      recommended that the Budget Committee seek Judicial Conference
                      endorsement for Congress to provide direct appropriations to the FPS, as
                      opposed to the FPS charging each agency and branch of government on a pro-
                      rata basis for its services.

                      CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE JUDGE POSITIONS

                               After consideration of the report of the Committee on the
                      Administration of the Magistrate Judges System and the recommendations of
                      the Director of the Administrative Office and the respective district courts and
                      circuit judicial councils, the Judicial Conference increased the salary of the
                      part-time magistrate judge position at Eureka in the Northern District of

    California from Level 5 ($25,512 per annum) to Level 2 ($63,786 per annum),
    and made no changes in the number, locations, salaries, or arrangements of
    the full-time and part-time magistrate judge positions in the following
    districts: the District of New Jersey, the Middle District of North Carolina,
    the Southern District of West Virginia, the Southern District of Ohio, the
    Western District of Tennessee, and the Western District of Missouri. The
    Judicial Conference also made no change in the location, salary, or
    arrangements of the part-time magistrate judge position at Salisbury in the
    District of Maryland.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges
    System reported that as part of its cost-containment efforts it would continue
    its practice of not considering any requests for additional full-time magistrate
    judge positions at its December meetings. Pursuant to the September 2004
    Judicial Conference policy regarding the review of magistrate judge position
    vacancies (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 26), the Committee considered requests from
    three courts to fill vacancies in magistrate judge positions and determined that
    the three vacancies should be filled. Currently, three magistrate judge
    positions are being held vacant. As part of its ongoing oversight and review
    of the magistrate judge recall program, the Committee reviewed a cost-benefit
    study of the program prepared by staff. It determined that the program to
    recall retired magistrate judges to active service continues to be effective in
    providing needed assistance to courts at a lower cost than authorizing
    additional permanent positions and should be continued.

DISABILITY ORDERS
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

           The Committee to Review Circuit Council Conduct and Disability

                               On recommendation of the Committee on Space and Facilities, the
                      Judicial Conference endorsed core values for the judiciaryโs space and
                      facilities program to serve as a foundation for the programโs long-range
                      strategic plan and the judiciaryโs long-range facilities planning process. The
                      core values pertain to the availability, function, adequacy, sufficiency, cost,
                      and structural security of U.S. courthouses.

ASSET MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND
PROJECT SCORING

        As part of the judiciaryโs comprehensive cost-containment strategy
adopted by the Judicial Conference in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04,
pp. 6-7), the Committee on Space and Facilities has been re-evaluating the
judiciaryโs long-range facilities planning process. The Committee determined
that the process, which had been initiated in 1988 (JCUS-MAR 88, p. 39) and
subsequently refined (see, e.g., JCUS-MAR 95, pp. 31-32; JCUS-MAR 96,
p. 36; JCUS-SEP 02, p. 63), did not address the benefits of a project as
compared to its financial impact. After obtaining input from the courts, the
Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference adopt, in concept, asset
management planning as an objective methodology that identifies the costs
and benefits of alternatives to enhance the long-range facilities planning
process. The Committee also recommended that the Conference endorse, in
concept and subject to further refinement, asset management planning as the
new methodology for scoring and placing courthouse projects on a five-year
courthouse project plan, to apply to the 35 projects without congressional
appropriations or authorizations2 on the Five-Year Courthouse Project Plan
for FYs 2005-2009 and to future projects. The remaining 18 projects on that
plan, which have congressional authorizations and appropriations and were
scored previously under the judiciaryโs existing methodology, would not be
subject to the asset management planning process. The Conference adopted
the Committeeโs recommendations.


INDEPENDENT REAL PROPERTY AUTHORITY

        In September 2005, facing skyrocketing rental costs and increasing
frustration with the judiciaryโs dependent relationship with the General
Services Administration, the then Committee on Security and Facilities
recommended that the Judicial Conference reaffirm its 1989 policy to seek
independent real property authority for the judiciary (JCUS-SEP 89, p. 81) .
The Conference recommitted the matter to the Space and Facilities

 These projects were also subject to a two-year space moratorium adopted by
the Judicial Conference in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 34-35).

                      Committee3 so that it could develop, in consultation with the Budget
                      Committee, a plan illustrating how independent real property authority could
                      be implemented (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 40). After endorsing general concepts of a
                      draft implementation plan,4 and obtaining and incorporating the views of the
                      Budget Committee, the Committee on Space and Facilities recommended that
                      the Judicial Conference affirm its continued support for legislation to establish
                      independent real property authority for the judiciary separate from GSA, with
                      the form and timing of seeking and implementing such authority to be subject
                      to approval by the Executive Committee in consultation with the Space and
                      Facilities Committee and the Budget Committee. The Conference adopted the
                      Committeeโs recommendation.


                      COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION PLAN FOR
                      FISCAL YEARS 2007 AND 2008

                              In September 2005, the Judicial Conference agreed to seek FY 2007
                      courthouse construction funding for pending projects in Buffalo, New York;
                      Salt Lake City, Utah; Jackson, Mississippi; Fort Pierce, Florida; and
                      Savannah, Georgia, and it deferred action on four other projects (San Antonio,
                      Texas; Mobile, Alabama; Rockford, Illinois; and San Jose, California) until
                      March 2006. Noting the continuing significant security and operations
                      problems at the locations of the four deferred projects, the Committee
                      recommended that the Conference seek funding in FY 2008 for those four
                      projects, as well as for the five projects endorsed for FY 2007 that remain
                      unfunded. The Committee also recommended that the FY 2007 request be
                      amended to include funding for site acquisition for two of the four deferred
                      projects, San Antonio, Texas and San Jose, California. The Conference
                      adopted the Committeeโs recommendations.

                       Effective October 2005, the Judicial Conference divided the Security and
                      Facilities Committee into a Committee on Space and Facilities and a
                      Committee on Judicial Security (JCUS-SEP 05, pp. 5-6).
                      4
                       The Committee will continue to refine the implementation plan to reflect
                      emerging trends in real property management and the terms of the authorizing
                      legislation ultimately enacted.

BUDGET CHECK PROCESS FOR
NON-PROSPECTUS SPACE PROJECTS

        In September 2004, in order to control rental costs, the Judicial
Conference endorsed an interim budget check process for all pending space
requests, to be performed jointly by the Administrative Office and circuit
judicial council staff, to ensure that alternative space, future rent implications,
and affordability by the judiciary are considered prior to project approval. If
funding is determined not to be available, but a circuit judicial council
nevertheless determines that the space is necessary, then the council must seek
an exception from the Judicial Conference through the Space and Facilities
Committee, in coordination with the Budget Committee, to proceed with the
project (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 36). At this session, on recommendation of the
Committee, the Judicial Conference reaffirmed that all non-prospectus space
requests are subject to the budget check process and endorsed the following
time frame for consideration of requests for exceptions for non-prospectus
space projects:

       A request for an exception for a non-prospectus space project
       will be considered sequentially, first by the Space and
       Facilities Committee at its June or December meeting; second,
       by the Budget Committee at its July or January meeting; and
       finally, by the Judicial Conference at its September or March
       session.


JUDICIAL SPACE EMERGENCIES

        As part of the Committeeโs cost-containment initiative to re-evaluate
the long-range facilities planning process, the Committee considered the
conditions under which a judicial space emergency should be declared. Based
on its review, the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference
approve the following policy:

       A building is eligible to be considered a judicial space
       emergency when the Committee on Space and Facilities
       determines that, among other things, (1) the court building is
       severely damaged or (2) it has an excessive caseload that
       impacts its space. The Committee on Space and Facilities will
       examine each emergency situation on a case-by-case basis to


                                        27
Judicial Conference of the United States

                               determine whether to recommend that the Judicial Conference
                               declare the project a space emergency.

                      The Committee noted that in making its case-by-case determinations, it would
                      take into account whether any unique situations merit the declaration of a
                      space emergency. The Conference approved the Committeeโs
                      recommendation.


                      CRITERIA FOR CLOSURE OF
                      CERTAIN COURT FACILITIES

                               In March 1997, the Judicial Conference adopted criteria for circuit
                      judicial councils to use in determining whether to close facilities without a
                      resident judge (JCUS-MAR 97, p. 18-19). As a cost-containment measure,
                      this Committee recently undertook a review of those criteria and whether they
                      should also be applied to closure of one-judge court facilities. After obtaining
                      views from judges and court personnel, the Committee recommended that the
                      Judicial Conference adopt revised closure criteria factors and weights and
                      apply the criteria only to non-resident judge locations. Under the new
                      methodology, an overall closure score would be developed by comparing a
                      weighted average for three criteria scores (facility usage, location, and
                      building condition) to the fourth criterion score (building operating cost). The
                      circuit judicial councils, which have the statutory authority to determine
                      whether court accommodations are necessary (28 U.S.C. ยง 462(b)), would
                      then determine if a facility should be recommended for closure. The
                      Conference adopted the Committeeโs recommendation.


                      U.S. COURTS DESIGN GUIDE

                              The Committee has been conducting a comprehensive review of the
                      U.S. Courts Design Guide to identify revisions that would control costs
                      without affecting functionality. In September 2005, the Judicial Conference
                      approved several Phase I revisions to the Design Guide pertaining to court
                      office space but recommitted for further Committee consideration proposed
                      revisions pertaining to chambers suites (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 39). For this
                      session, the Committee recommended modified Phase I revisions for
                      chambers suites, as well as Phase II technical revisions concerning public
                      space or atria, raised or access flooring, and acoustics. The Conference
                      adopted the Phase II technical revisions as recommended and, after
                      discussion, adopted the newly recommended Phase I chambers suites

                                                            28
                                                                   March 14, 2006

revisions, with further modifications to the standards for ranges of shelving in
judgesโ chambers.


APPELLATE CHAMBERS IN LEASED SPACE

       Concerned about the cost and security implications of providing
chambers for circuit judges in leased space, the Committee recommended, and
the Conference agreed to adopt, the following policy:

a.     If a new circuit judge is appointed in a locale within a normal
       commuting distance of an existing courthouse or court facility with
       space available for a circuit judge, that space (rather than private
       leased space) should be assigned to the new circuit judge. If more
       than one chambers is available in the court facility, the new circuit
       judge may select among the available chambers.

b.     If the available chambers does not contain adequate square footage to
       accommodate the new circuit judge and five staff members, or if there
       are not private offices for four law clerks, a proposed alternative
       consistent with the standards of the U.S. Courts Design Guide may be
       considered by the circuit judicial council to the extent funding is
       available.


LEASE CONSTRUCTION

        Noting that lease construction as a method for building court facilities
raises space planning and monetary concerns, the Committee on Space and
Facilities recommended, and the Judicial Conference agreed to, the following:

a.     That circuit judicial councils be advised that lease-construct projects,
       including those that were approved by a circuit judicial council prior
       to the adoption of the Conferenceโs budget check process in
       September 2004 and that have experienced cost increases since
       estimates were initially developed by GSA, are subject to the budget
       check process; and

b.     That a qualified construction manager be hired by the judiciary to
       monitor each lease-construct project during design and construction.

                      requests for exceptions and exemptions to the space moratoria and budget

             RESOLUTIONS HONORING
          ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE DIRECTOR

     COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

In recognition of twenty years of distinguished service to the federal
judiciary, we, the Committee on the Administrative Office, express
our sincere appreciation to Leonidas Ralph Mecham, Director of the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts. A remarkable man
of remarkable achievement, under Director Mechamโs stewardship, the
federal courts have enjoyed a golden age of judicial administration.

During his tenure as the longest-serving director of the Administrative
Office, Director Mecham transformed federal judicial administration
through the force of his vision and leadership, reinventing the
Administrative Office to improve its service to the federal judiciary.
Since he became Administrative Office Director in 1985, Director
Mecham has launched countless successful initiatives in support of the
independence and quality of the judicial branch, to assist federal
judges and judicial employees, and to promote the effectiveness of
court operations. His program of decentralizing administrative
authorities to the courts has empowered chief judges and court
executives by providing them with greater local administrative control,
flexibility, and accountability, which, in turn, has resulted in better
service to the public and savings to the taxpayers.

He has improved Administrative Office relations with judges and court
staff by working closely with the federal judgesโ professional
associations and by establishing court advisory groups, composed of
court executives and judges, to provide feedback and advice on
important issues. He has also emphasized the key roles played by
bankruptcy judges and magistrate judges and has worked to increase
their participation in the judiciaryโs policy making processes.

Over the course of his service, Ralph Mecham has shown exceptional
leadership on legislative and budgetary matters, successfully obtaining
funding for judiciary operations and courthouses in the face of
continuing fiscal austerity. He was the driving force in attaining
funding and approval for the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary
Building. He has improved court business processes and service to the
public by championing the innovative use of information technology,
particularly through the creation of a judiciary-wide data

                      communications network and the provision of electronic case filing
                      and remote public access to court records.

                      Ralph Mecham has worked tirelessly to improve the quality of judgesโ
                      and judiciary employeesโ lives by improving personal security for
                      judges and their families, strengthening courthouse security,
                      improving emergency response capability, fighting for fair
                      compensation for judicial officers and executives, developing a
                      ground-breaking benefits program, and protecting judges aged 65 and
                      older from drastic increases in their life insurance premiums.

                      Therefore, in recognition of his courageous leadership and twenty
                      years of dedicated service to the Judicial Conference, judges, and the
                      entire judicial family, and in recognition of his outstanding
                      accomplishments that have made an indelible contribution to the
                      administration of justice, the Committee on the Administrative Office
                      commends Director Leonidas Ralph Mecham.

                      The Judicial Conference Committee on the Administration of the
                      Bankruptcy System commends Leonidas Ralph Mecham, Director of
                      the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, for his
                      assiduous and effective work on behalf of the federal judiciary for over
                      20 years. The Directorโs willingness to become personally involved in
                      addressing major issues affecting the judiciaryโas demonstrated most
                      recently by his dedicated efforts to enhance compensation and benefits
                      for judges, increase their personal security and that of their families,
                      and ensure that the judicial branch receives adequate appropriationsโ
                      as contributed immeasurably to the administration of the federal court
                      system. His tenure as Director has been marked by a degree of
                      dedication to the judiciary that has set a gold standard for all
                      successors.

                      The members of the Committee express their sincere appreciation to
                      Director Mecham for his strong, inspired support and devoted service
                      to the judiciary.

                 COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET

In appreciation and recognition of the Honorable Leonidas Ralph
Mecham, the Budget Committee of the Judicial Conference extends
our heartfelt appreciation for his distinguished leadership as Director
of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for nearly
twenty-one years.

His outstanding guidance and direction leave an enduring legacy. His
devoted and skillful leadership enabled the judiciary to carry out its
mission and serve the American people. The judiciary as a whole has
benefitted greatly from his keen intellect; his calm but highly effective
management skills; and his personal integrity and warmth. Working
with him as members of the Budget Committee has been a source of
great personal pleasure and a high honor to all of us.

His contribution to the communications between the legislative and
judicial branches on funding issues has greatly enhanced the stature of
the judiciaryโs budget. The trust that now exists between these
branches is a result of his openness with Congress and with Judicial
Conference committee chairs. His determined defense of the
independence of the Judiciary and its budget during a time of major
growth in workload has been extremely effective.

To Ralph, we express our genuine and heartfelt thanks. The Budget
Committee will sorely miss his gentle guidance and courageous spirit.
We wish the best to him and his family and hope for many future
associations with him in the years to come.

Mecham, Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts from 1985 to 2006.

Appointed to the position by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in 1985,

                      of skilled leadership and earned our deep respect and sincere gratitude
                      for his innumerable contributions. The Committee acknowledges with
                      appreciation his commitment and dedicated service to the Judicial
                      Conference and the entire federal judiciary. He will be greatly missed.

                             COMMITTEE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

                      The Judicial Conference Committee on Information Technology
                      recognizes with grateful appreciation Leonidas Ralph Mecham for his

                      As Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Mecham has played a
                      pivotal role in assisting this Committee to fulfill its charter of
                      providing policy recommendations, planning, and oversight of the
                      judiciary information technology program. Under his management,
                      the data communications network connected the entire judiciary,
                      electronic systems revolutionized case management, and unparalleled
                      efforts were made to meet the information privacy and security needs
                      of judges.

                      We acknowledge Mr. Mechamโs lasting contribution to the judiciaryโs
                      information technology program, resulting from his exemplary
                      leadership, the dedication of scarce resources, tireless management,
                      and determination. We extend our heartfelt thanks and gratitude for
                      his matchless efforts.

                      The Committee on the Judicial Branch recognizes Administrative
                      Office Director Leonidas Ralph Mecham for his commitment to
                      excellence and for his leadership of the Administrative Office of the

                      Since his appointment in 1985, Director Mecham has devoted tireless
                      energy in support of the independence of the judicial branch and the
                      advancement of judicial administration. Working with the Judicial
                      Conference and its committees, Director Mecham decentralized
                      administrative authorities to the courts, shaped the Administrative
                      Office into an outstanding service organization, and tirelessly pursued
                      increased appropriations, judgeships, courthouses, improved
                      compensation and benefits, enhanced security, and other issues of
                      concern to the judicial branch.

          COMMITTEE ON SPACE AND FACILITIES

The Judicial Conference Committee on Space and Facilities, by
unanimous resolution, commends with deep appreciation and respect
the 20 years of distinguished and dedicated service to the federal
judiciary of Leonidas Ralph Mecham, Director of the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts.

Beginning in July 1985, Director Mecham tirelessly pursued and
successfully revived a court space and facilities program through new
construction and major renovations, which considerably improved the
administration of justice and court operations. During his tenure, 68
new courthouses were constructed nationwide. Twenty more are now
in the planning or design stages due to Director Mechamโs personal
commitment to the facilities needs of the courts. The Committee
praises his outstanding commitment and unparalleled achievements to
the space and facilities program upon his retirement.
