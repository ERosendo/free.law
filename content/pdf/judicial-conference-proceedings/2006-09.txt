                      RESOLUTION

                              The Judicial Conference approved a recommendation of the Executive
                      Committee to adopt the following resolution recognizing the substantial
                      contributions made by the Judicial Conference committee chairs whose terms
                      of service end in 2006:

                                    The Judicial Conference of the United States recognizes
                               with appreciation, respect, and admiration the following
                               judicial officers:

                                           HONORABLE ROBERT B. KUGLER
                                           Committee on the Administrative Office

                                           HONORABLE NINA GERSHON
                             Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System

                                              HONORABLE JANE R. ROTH
                                              Committee on Space and Facilities

                                    Appointed as committee chairs by the Chief Justice of the
                               United States, these outstanding jurists have played a vital role
                               in the administration of the federal court system. These judges
                               served with distinction as leaders of their Judicial Conference
                               committees while, at the same time, continuing to perform their
                               duties as judges in their own courts. They have set a standard
                               of skilled leadership and earned our deep respect and sincere
                               gratitude for their innumerable contributions. We

                                                               September 19, 2006

       acknowledge with appreciation their commitment and
       dedicated service to the Judicial Conference and to the entire
       federal judiciary.


JUDICIAL ETHICS

        Media accounts alleging that certain judges may have participated in
cases in which they had a financial interest or failed to include in financial
disclosure reports their attendance at privately funded educational seminars
have led to renewed congressional interest in judicial ethics, including efforts
to impose an inspector general on the judiciary. The Executive Committee
discussed the issue on a number of occasions and agreed that a strong,
appropriate response was necessary to assure Congress and the public that the
judiciary is committed to upholding the highest ethical standards and
maintaining accountability. With the endorsement of the Chief Justice, the
Committee, in August 2006, distributed to judges and congressional
leadership a report on the status of the judiciary’s efforts to address judicial
ethics issues. In addition, the Committee asked the Codes of Conduct
Committee to consider on an expedited basis proposals regarding the use of
automated conflict-checking software (see infra “Judicial Ethics,” p. 11). It
had also previously asked the Judicial Branch Committee to make proposals
to the Conference, in coordination with the Codes of Conduct Committee,
concerning judges’ attendance at privately funded educational seminars
(see infra “Judges’ Attendance at Privately Funded Educational Programs,”
p. 24).


IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION

        In March 2006, anticipating quick action in Congress on pending
immigration legislation, the Executive Committee approved two
recommendations of the Federal-State Jurisdiction Committee on the
Conference’s behalf: (a) that the Conference oppose a provision that would
require a “certificate of reviewability” from a single circuit judge before a
Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision could be reviewed in a court of
appeals by a three-judge panel; and (b) that Congress be urged to provide the
judicial branch with sufficient resources to carry out its responsibilities for
handling any additional immigration caseload resulting from such legislation.
The Executive Committee also reaffirmed, in the context of immigration
cases, the Conference’s previously stated opposition to the consolidation of
appeals in a single court and determined to reiterate that position for purposes

                                       5
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      of a Senate hearing on the matter. Further, the Committee agreed that any
                      communication to Congress on this topic should also express support for
                      additional resources for the executive branch to litigate and review
                      immigration cases, and support for modifications to BIA composition and
                      procedures, to enhance administrative review of these cases.


                      COURT SPACE PROJECTS

                              At the request of the Director of the Administrative Office, the
                      Executive Committee considered, and then endorsed, requests for exemptions
                      from the Judicial Conference’s prospectus-level space moratorium for court
                      space projects in Charlotte, North Carolina; Toledo, Ohio; Orlando, Florida;
                      Billings, Montana; Bangor, Maine; Springfield, Massachusetts; New Bern,
                      North Carolina; and Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition, the Committee approved,
                      on behalf of the Conference, a recommendation of the Committee on Space
                      and Facilities that a judicial space emergency be declared with respect to the
                      court facility in Billings, Montana. Also on behalf of the Conference and on
                      recommendation of the Space and Facilities Committee, which had
                      coordinated with the Budget Committee, the Executive Committee approved
                      an exception to the Conference’s budget check process so that chambers could
                      be obtained through a commercial lease for a newly appointed Ninth Circuit
                      judge for whom an existing chambers suite was not available. The Executive
                      Committee conditioned its actions with respect to the projects in Billings,
                      Bangor, Springfield, New Bern, and Cincinnati and the Ninth Circuit judge’s
                      chambers project on certain funding arrangements and on charging the
                      additional rent associated with each project against the respective circuit
                      council’s future space rental cap (see infra “Rent Budget Cap,” p. 10). In
                      addition, it conditioned the Billings and Ninth Circuit chambers projects on
                      application of the latest changes to the U.S. Courts Design Guide.


                      MISCELLANEOUS ACTIONS

                               The Executive Committee—

                      •        Approved, on behalf of the Judicial Conference and on
                               recommendation of the Committees on Court Administration and Case
                               Management and Information Technology, an annual report to
                               Congress on deferred court compliance with section 205 of the E-
                               Government Act of 2002, and authorized transmittal of that report to
                               Congress as specified in the Act;

                                                             6

    •      Agreed to a legislative strategy proposed by the Court Administration
           and Case Management Committee regarding the issue of cameras in
           the courtroom and delegated to that committee, assisted by the
           Administrative Office, the authority to respond to Congress on actions
           it may take on cameras issues and report to the Executive Committee;

    •      Pending final congressional action on the judiciary’s appropriations
           for fiscal year 2007, approved fiscal year 2007 interim financial plans
           for the Salaries and Expenses, Defender Services, Court Security, and
           Fees of Jurors and Commissioners accounts and for the Electronic
           Public Access program, and endorsed a strategy for distributing court
           allotments among the court programs; and

    •      Recommended that the Conference approve memorial resolutions in
           memory of two former Conference members (see infra “Memorial
           Resolutions,” pp. 38-41).


COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that it discussed
    recently introduced legislation to establish an inspector general in the
    judiciary and the communication effort to explain the Judicial Conference’s
    strong opposition to that proposal. This opposition arises from concerns that
    an inspector general would seriously undermine the principle of an
    independent federal judiciary and that the judiciary already has an extensive
    system for oversight and review that effectively addresses operational
    integrity and stewardship. The Committee endorsed several enhancements to
    the Administrative Office’s audit and review program, including a more
    formal process to follow up on actions taken by courts to address audit
    findings. The Committee selected the first two recipients of its Leonidas
    Ralph Mecham Award for Exemplary Service to the Courts, created by the
    Committee to recognize individual Administrative Office staff for significant
    accomplishments.

             COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
             OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

                      BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIPS

                              In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 152(b)(3), the Judicial Conference
                      conducts a comprehensive review of all judicial districts every other year to
                      assess the continuing need for authorized bankruptcy judgeships. By
                      December 31 of each even-numbered year, the Conference reports its
                      recommendations to Congress for the elimination of any authorized
                      bankruptcy judgeship position that can be eliminated when a vacancy exists
                      by reason of resignation, retirement, removal, or death. On recommendation
                      of the Bankruptcy Committee, which relied on the results of the 2006
                      continuing-need survey, the Judicial Conference agreed to take the following
                      actions:

                      a.       Recommend to Congress that no bankruptcy judgeship be statutorily
                               eliminated; and

                      b.       Advise the Eighth and Ninth Circuit Judicial Councils, as appropriate,
                               to consider not filling vacancies in the District of South Dakota, the
                               District of Alaska, and the Central District of California that currently
                               exist or may occur by reason of resignation, retirement, removal, or
                               death, until there is a demonstrated need to do so.


                      SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT REGULATIONS

                              In March 2006, the Judicial Conference approved an amendment to
                      section 2.01 of the Judicial Conference Regulations for the Selection,
                      Appointment, and Reappointment of United States Bankruptcy Judges to
                      make publication of judicial vacancy announcements through print
                      advertisements in local newspapers optional, rather than required, and to
                      permit electronic publication of those announcements (JCUS-MAR 06,
                      pp. 9-10). At this session, on recommendation of the Committee, the
                      Conference made a parallel change to section 5.02(a) of the regulations,
                      dealing with reappointment notices, to permit publication of a notice of an
                      incumbent’s willingness to be reappointed to be made through electronic
                      means and to make newspaper advertisement optional.




                                                               8
                                                              September 19, 2006



DEBTOR AUDIT STANDARDS

        Section 603(a) of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-8) requires the Judicial Conference to
establish procedures in bankruptcy administrator districts to determine the
accuracy, veracity, and completeness of petitions, schedules, and other
information a debtor is required to provide in cases filed in chapter 7 or
chapter 13 cases in which the debtor is an individual. Audits pursuant to
§ 603(a) must be in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
unless the Judicial Conference determines to develop alternative standards.
Noting that the ten generally accepted auditing standards were developed in
the context of auditing financial statements of businesses, and that § 603(a)
applies by its terms to audits of individuals only, the Committee
recommended alternative standards modeled after standards adopted by the
Attorney General for judicial districts served by United States trustees. The
proposed standards are consistent with generally accepted auditing standards.
The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

        The Bankruptcy Committee reported that it approved implementation
of a new bankruptcy judge recall registry system on the J-Net to enable courts
needing assistance from a recalled judge to identify, quickly and easily,
retired judges who have expressed a willingness to serve on recall. The
Committee also forwarded to the Court Administration and Case Management
Committee a number of recommendations for changes to the Bankruptcy
Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule (see infra “Miscellaneous Fees,” pp. 12-
14); endorsed a resolution in support of maintaining existing bankruptcy
clerk’s office staffing levels through the next fiscal year to ensure effective
transition and implementation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
Consumer Protection Act of 2005; and endorsed a proposal that the
Administrative Office make available electronically “fillable” versions of
bankruptcy forms.

Judicial Conference of the United States

             COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
                      FISCAL YEAR 2008 BUDGET REQUEST

                              Noting the continuation of a constrained budget environment, the
                      Budget Committee recommended a fiscal year 2008 budget request that was
                      lower than the funding levels proposed by the program committees. The
                      Judicial Conference approved the budget request subject to amendments
                      necessary as a result of new legislation, other actions of the Conference, or
                      any other reason the Executive Committee considers necessary and
                      appropriate.


                      FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE FUNDING

                             Currently the Federal Protective Service (FPS) charges individual
                      agencies on a pro-rata basis for the services it provides. Concluding that
                      savings in administrative costs could be realized if the FPS were funded
                      through direct appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security, the
                      Budget Committee, at the request of the Judicial Security Committee,
                      recommended that the Judicial Conference (a) ask Congress to provide direct
                      appropriations to the FPS, and (b) make a request to the President to
                      incorporate direct funding for FPS charges into the President’s fiscal year
                      2008 budget request. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendations.


                      RENT BUDGET CAP

                               On recommendation of the Budget Committee, and after discussion,
                      the Judicial Conference set an annual cap on rent for all future rent
                      requirements at an average annual growth rate of 4.9 percent for fiscal years
                      2009 through 2016 in order to control space rental costs. The amount of the
                      cap is provisional based on information available to the Budget Committee at
                      its July 2006 meeting and is subject to reconsideration when the fiscal year
                      2009 budget is formulated, should actions or events outside the control of the
                      judiciary or the adoption of budget caps covering other budget categories
                      require such reconsideration.

    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

           The Committee on the Budget reported that it considered strategies for
    developing budget caps for non-space areas of the Salaries and Expenses
    account to be used in formulating future budget requests and stated it would
    work with program committees to identify the impact of proposed caps in
    each area of the budget. It also discussed flexibility in budget decentralization
    rules with regard to ways to enable movement of funds from one court unit to
    another. The Committee supported the development of and continued to
    endorse a comprehensive financial management continuing education
    program for court staff, and it discussed the judiciary's ongoing efforts to
    acquire additional resources from Congress and ways to enhance
    congressional outreach.


COMMITTEE ON CODES OF CONDUCT
    JUDICIAL ETHICS

            In response to a request from the Executive Committee (see supra
    “Judicial Ethics,” p. 5), and after consultation with several other Conference
    committees, the Committee on Codes of Conduct recommended that the
    Judicial Conference adopt a conflict-screening policy that mandates checking
    for financial conflicts of interest with the aid of computer software. The
    policy would be administered and directed by the circuit councils under the
    authority set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 332(d)(1) and by the individual courts not
    subject to the authority of a circuit council. After discussion, the Conference
    modified slightly and then adopted the Committee’s recommendation. Use of
    automated conflict screening is intended to be an addition to, and not a
    replacement for, each judge’s personal review of matters for conflicts.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that since its last report
    to the Conference in March 2006, the Committee received 26 new written
    inquiries and issued 26 written advisory responses. During this period, the
    average response time for requests was 13 days. The Chairman received and
    responded to 39 informal inquiries (by telephone, electronic mail, or in

             COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
             AND CASE MANAGEMENT

                      MISCELLANEOUS FEES

                              Chapter 15 Reopening Fee. Item 11 of the Bankruptcy Court
                      Miscellaneous Fee Schedule provides that the fee for reopening a bankruptcy
                      case is the same as the filing fee prescribed in 28 U.S.C. § 1930(a) for
                      commencing a new case. The filing fee for commencing a chapter 15 case,
                      however, is a miscellaneous fee authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 1930(b) and not a
                      statutory fee set forth in § 1930(a); therefore, Item 11 does not provide a
                      reopening fee for chapter 15 cases. On recommendation of the Committee on
                      Court Administration and Case Management, the Conference agreed to amend
                      Item 11 of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule to create a
                      reopening fee for chapter 15 cases equal to the chapter 15 filing fee contained
                      in Item 16 of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule as of the date
                      of the request to reopen.

                             Exemptions from Reopening Fee. Item 11 of the Bankruptcy Court
                      Miscellaneous Fee Schedule provides an exemption from the fee for
                      reopening a bankruptcy case “for actions related to the debtor’s discharge.”
                      Concerned that this exemption could be interpreted to apply in cases in which
                      no discharge had been entered, the Committee recommended that Item 11 be
                      amended to clarify the two situations in which the exemption from the
                      reopening fee is applicable (i.e., reopening a case to enforce the discharge and
                      reopening a case to file nondischargability complaints under Bankruptcy Rule
                      4007(b)) and to expressly state that the reopening fee applies to requests to
                      reopen cases in which the court did not enter a discharge. The Conference
                      approved the recommendation.

                              Chapter 7 Trustee Fee. Section 330(b) of the Bankruptcy Code
                      requires that the trustee in a chapter 7 case be paid a fee of $60–$45 from the
                      statutory filing fee and an additional $15 to be prescribed by the Judicial
                      Conference. For initial filings, the additional $15 trustee fee is set forth in
                      Item 9 of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule. In establishing
                      the fee for reopening a chapter 7 case and the fee for splitting a joint chapter 7
                      case, Items 11 and 19 of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule,


                                                             12
                                                                September 19, 2006

respectively, require petitioners to pay the amount of the statutory filing fee
but do not require payment of the additional $15 trustee fee. In order to
comply with the requirement of 11 U.S.C. § 330(b) regarding chapter 7 trustee
fees, on recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to amend
the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule to add a $15 chapter 7
trustee fee to the fee for reopening a chapter 7 case (Item 11) and to the fee for
splitting a joint chapter 7 case (Item 19).

        Adversary Proceeding Fee. Item 6 of the Bankruptcy Court
Miscellaneous Fee Schedule links the fee for filing an adversary proceeding to
the statutory fee for filing a civil action. Title X of the Deficit Reduction Act
of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-171) increased the civil action filing fee from $250
to $350, which has the effect of increasing the fee for filing an adversary
proceeding, as well. Noting that the two types of actions can vary
significantly, and that the amount in controversy in bankruptcy actions is
typically much lower than that in civil actions, the Committee recommended
that the fee for filing an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy be delinked from
the civil action filing fee, that the fee remain $250, and that the fee schedule
be amended accordingly. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
recommendation.

        Bankruptcy Appellate Docketing Fee. The fee for docketing an appeal
or a cross appeal from a bankruptcy court determination (Items 15 and 21,
respectively, of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule) is linked
to the appellate court docketing fee (Item 1 of the Court of Appeals
Miscellaneous Fee Schedule), which the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 raised
from $250 to $450. Since bankruptcy appeals are usually heard in the first
instance in a district court or by a bankruptcy appellate panel, and then may
be taken to a court of appeals, two docketing fees would be required in those
cases in which a second appeal is taken. Because of the unique structure of
the bankruptcy appellate process, the Committee recommended that the
docketing fee for appeals and cross appeals from a bankruptcy court
determination be de-linked from the appellate court docketing fee and remain
at $250, but that an additional $200 fee be required if a direct appeal or cross
appeal from the bankruptcy court to the court of appeals is granted, to equal
the $450 appellate court docketing fee. The Conference agreed to amend the
fee schedule in accordance with the Committee’s recommendation.

        Bankruptcy Direct Cross-Appeal Docketing Fee . On recommendation
of the Committee, the Conference agreed to amend Item 1 of the Court of
Appeals Miscellaneous Fee Schedule to provide that no fees would be
collected by the courts of appeals under that item for docketing direct cross


                                       13
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      appeals in bankruptcy cases if fees had already been collected under Item 21
                      of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule for such appeals. A
                      similar amendment to Item 1 was made in March 2006 with regard to direct
                      bankruptcy appeals (JCUS-MAR 06, pp. 12-13).

                               Conversion Fees. On recommendation of the Committee, the
                      Conference amended Item 10 of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee
                      Schedule to include a general bankruptcy conversion fee to be assessed
                      whenever the filing fee of the chapter to which a case is converted exceeds the
                      filing fee for the chapter under which the case was initially filed. This fee is
                      equal to the difference in the filing fees. However, in the event a case is
                      converted to a chapter with a lower filing fee, a refund would not be granted.
                      Conversions from chapter 7 or 13 to chapter 11 are specifically excluded
                      because fees are assessed for these conversions pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
                      § 1930(a).


                      ELECTRONIC PUBLIC ACCESS

                              Fee Schedule. Currently, the Electronic Public Access (EPA) Fee
                      Schedule prohibits users of the Public Access to Court Electronic Records
                      (PACER) system who are exempt from EPA fees from selling the information
                      they receive from that system; however, it does not prohibit users from
                      disseminating the same information at no charge. Therefore, the Committee
                      recommended that the fee schedule be amended to prohibit any transfer of
                      case information received under a fee exemption absent express authorization
                      from the court. The Committee also recommended that language be added to
                      the fee schedule policy notes to state that this prohibition does not apply to the
                      quotation or reference to such materials in a scholarly or other similar work.
                      The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.

                               Crime Victim Notification Data. To assist the Department of Justice
                      in fulfilling its statutory obligation under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, 18
                      U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2), to notify crime victims of upcoming proceedings in
                      federal cases, the Judicial Conference, on recommendation of the Committee,
                      authorized the Administrative Office to enter into a memorandum of
                      understanding with the Department of Justice to provide the Department with
                      an electronic feed of case information, with the following conditions:

                      a.       the Department will not be required to pay the EPA fees for the
                               information received, but agrees to reimburse the judiciary for
                               the costs incurred in programming the data feed;

                                                             14

b.     the data transferred is limited to the information required to
       fulfill the victim-notification responsibilities set by statute;

c.     the data is provided directly to the Department’s Victim
       Notification System (VNS);

d.     the Department agrees to use the information only for victim
       notification; and

e.     the Department agrees not to sell or transfer the information
       other than for the purposes of victim notification (with an
       exception for transfers to judicial branch organizations, such as
       pretrial services and probation offices).


JURY MATTERS

        Jury Service. To impress upon the public the serious nature of jury
service, on recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed
to seek amendments to the statutes establishing penalties for failure to appear
in response to summonses relating to jury service, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1864(b) and
1866(g), to increase the maximum amount of the fine from $100 to $5,000,
and to offer an option for community service.

      Grand Juror Handbook. The Conference adopted a Committee
recommendation to amend the Handbook for Federal Grand Jurors to
conform with the Model Grand Jury Charge revisions approved by the
Conference in March 2005 (JCUS-MAR 05, p. 12), with two additional
changes for clarity.


CONSOLIDATION OF DISTRICT AND BANKRUPTCY COURT
CLERKS’ OFFICES IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

        Section 156(d) of title 28 requires Judicial Conference and
congressional approval of plans to consolidate bankruptcy and district court
clerks’ offices. In March 1998, the Conference adopted procedures for
considering consolidation plans (JCUS-MAR 98, pp. 10-11). Pursuant to
these procedures, the Committee, in consultation with the Bankruptcy
Committee, reviewed a joint proposal from the district and bankruptcy courts
of the District of Columbia to consolidate their clerks’ offices. The plan had
been endorsed by their circuit judicial council. Concluding that the proposal

                      could be expected to produce cost savings and that there would not be a
                      decrease in the quality of services to the judges, the bar, and the public, the
                      Committee recommended that the Conference endorse the consolidation. The
                      Conference agreed to the Committee’s recommendation, and Congress will be
                      notified of the Conference’s action.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                      reported that it considered, among other things, a wide array of issues
                      pertaining to the judiciary’s records management program, and that it offered
                      assistance to the Administrative Office in this area. The Committee also
                      discussed recent reports relating to judges who have issued rulings in cases in
                      which they may have had a conflict of interest due to financial interests in one
                      of the parties, and expressed its view to the Executive Committee that circuit
                      judicial councils should mandate use of the automated conflict-checking
                      capabilities of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) system.
                      The Committee also reviewed the ongoing cost-containment efforts relating to
                      libraries and law books, the law books and computer-assisted legal research
                      budget request for fiscal year 2008, and the final steps in the complete
                      migration from WestMate software to the current web-based Westlaw legal
                      research service.


             COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAW
                      FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT

                              A bill pending in the 109th Congress (S. 2453) would require the
                      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to sit en banc on a quarterly basis.
                      The Committee noted that members of the court are widely dispersed and that
                      the frequency of travel contemplated in the legislation would be costly and
                      inefficient, but concluded that meeting en banc, as appropriate to ensure
                      uniformity and consistency in decision-making, would be beneficial. On
                      recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to support
                      legislation that would authorize judges on the Foreign Intelligence
                      Surveillance Court to sit en banc, but to express its preference that such
                      sittings be authorized to occur at the court’s discretion. The Conference
                      adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION

        The Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation
of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2003 (Pub. L. No. 108-21) amended
28 U.S.C. § 991, regarding composition of the U. S. Sentencing Commission.
It replaced the requirement that at least three of the Commission’s voting
members must be federal judges with a provision that not more than three
such members may be federal judges. In September 2003, the Judicial
Conference expressed opposition to that provision, along with several others
in the PROTECT Act, noting that the judiciary and the Sentencing
Commission had not been consulted regarding the legislation (JCUS-SEP 03,
pp. 18-20). At this session, citing, among other things, the unique expertise
on sentencing issues that judges provide, the Committee recommended, and
the Conference agreed, that the judiciary affirmatively seek restoration of the
statutory requirement that at least three federal judges be included among the
voting members of the Sentencing Commission.
        .

SUPERVISED RELEASE

         Generally, the maximum length of a term of supervised release is
determined by the classification of the offense committed. The Committee
expressed the view that greater discretion to tailor the duration of a term of
supervised release to the specifics of a case would improve its effectiveness.
On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to
support an amendment to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b) to give the court authority to
impose a longer term of supervised release, based on specific findings, if the
unusual circumstances of a case indicate that a longer term is needed to
rehabilitate the offender, protect society, and otherwise serve the interest of
justice.


PROFITING FROM A CRIME

        On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
determined to support legislation that would establish “not profiting from a
crime” as a mandatory condition of probation and of supervised release and to
support similar legislation (to the extent it relates to the federal courts and the
administration of justice) to prevent criminals from profiting from their
crimes.

                      RESTITUTION

                               Currently, there is no authorization under federal law for general
                      restitution to crime victims. A judge may order restitution only if the loss
                      suffered by the victim falls within certain categories specified by statute. On
                      recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to support
                      legislation that would authorize general restitution in any criminal case at the
                      discretion of the judge when the circumstances of the case warrant it.


                      SENTENCING IN COCAINE CASES

                              Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99-570), 100
                      times as much powder cocaine as crack cocaine is needed to trigger the same
                      mandatory minimum sentences. Noting concern that this disparity could have
                      a corrosive effect on public confidence in the courts, the Committee
                      recommended that the Judicial Conference oppose the existing difference
                      between crack and powder cocaine sentences and support the reduction of that
                      difference. After discussion, the Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendation.


                      RESIDENTIAL REENTRY CENTERS

                              As a result of recent case law, a disparity exists among the circuits
                      with regard to the extent to which an inmate in Bureau of Prisons custody may
                      serve a term of incarceration in a residential reentry center. Noting the
                      statutory requirement that sentencing judges impose sufficient punishment,
                      but no more than is necessary to achieve the penological goals of the statute,
                      the Committee recommended that the Conference support legislation to
                      resolve the statutory ambiguities between 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c) and 18 U.S.C.
                      § 3621(b) that have given rise to the intercircuit disparity. The Conference
                      adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                      CRIME VICTIMS RIGHTS ADVISORY GROUP

                             On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed
                      to recommend to the U.S. Sentencing Commission that it establish a Crime

    Victims Rights Advisory Group, analogous in structure to the existing
    Practitioners Advisory Group and Probation Officers Advisory Group. Such a
    group would facilitate the exchange of ideas and information between crime
    victim advocates and the Sentencing Commission.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Criminal Law reported that on March 16, 2006, its
    chair testified on behalf of the Conference before the House Judiciary
    Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security about the impact
    of the 2005 Supreme Court decision in United States v. Booker. He noted that
    patterns of federal sentencing have not changed dramatically following
    Booker and urged that the courts of appeals be allowed to work through
    uncertainties caused by Booker and establish a jurisprudence of
    “reasonableness” review. The Criminal Law Committee endorsed the
    development of an automated system to transmit sentencing documentation to
    the U.S. Sentencing Commission and the Bureau of Prisons, endorsed
    centralizing Probation/Pretrial Services Automated Case Tracking System
    (PACTS) servers in a contract facility, and encouraged the use of evidence-
    based practice research in the supervision and treatment of federal defendants
    and offenders.


COMMITTEE ON DEFENDER SERVICES
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Defender Services reported that it had selected the
    Second, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits to participate in a pilot project under which
    the Defender Services appropriation will, for up to three years, fund three
    circuit positions to support the process of case budgeting, which is a high-
    priority cost-containment initiative. The Committee endorsed, for
    dissemination, a list of suggested “good practices” identified by the Vera
    Institute of Justice in its January 2006 report, “Good Practices for Panel
    Attorney Programs in the U.S. Courts of Appeals.” Consistent with the goals
    of the judiciary’s study on administrative services, the Committee approved a
    new protocol for maximizing the utilization of federal defender organization
    personnel through the sharing of services of certain non-attorney staff, within
    prescribed parameters. The Committee also approved federal defender
    organization budgets under its delegated authority from the Judicial
    Conference (JCUS-MAR 89, pp. 16-17).

             COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL-STATE JURISDICTION

                      VENUE

                               In March 2006, the Judicial Conference adopted several
                      recommendations for changes to the statutory provisions governing venue (28
                      U.S.C. § 1391 et seq.) (JCUS-MAR 06, p. 17). At this session, in continuance
                      of its jurisdictional improvements project, the Committee recommended, and
                      the Conference approved, seeking the following additional changes to clarify
                      and improve the venue statutes:

                      a.       Amend 28 U.S.C. § 1391 to authorize a civil action to be filed in any
                               division of a district, subject to the power of the district court to
                               provide by local rule or court order for the initial filing in a particular
                               division and for the transfer of any civil action between divisions of
                               the district;
                      b.       Amend 28 U.S.C. § 1404 to authorize the district court, in its
                               discretion, to transfer a civil action or other proceeding of a civil
                               nature anywhere within the district for trial or for any other phase of
                               the litigation;

                      c.       Amend 28 U.S.C. § 1391 to specify that district courts shall disregard
                               for venue purposes aliens and United States citizens who have their

                      TERRITORIAL COURT INTERPRETER PROGRAMS

                               A bill pending in the 109th Congress, S. 2611, the Comprehensive
                      Immigration Reform Act of 2006, would authorize financial assistance for
                      state court interpreter programs. At the request of the Pacific Islands
                      Committee of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council, which noted that local courts
                      in the Pacific island territories are experiencing the same challenges as the
                      state courts with regard to providing effective court interpreting services, the
                      Federal-State Jurisdiction Committee recommended that the Judicial
                      Conference seek inclusion of the United States territories and former trust
                      territories in any bill that authorizes or appropriates federal funding for state



                                                                20

    court interpreter programs. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
    recommendation.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

           The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction reported that it gave
    extensive consideration to immigration reform legislation pending in the 109th
    Congress and considered proposed legislation, not yet introduced in Congress,
    that would affect the jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade. The
    Committee received an update on the final regulations of the Social Security
    Administration pertaining to the disability claims process and was briefed on
    the capital habeas corpus study being undertaken by the Administrative Office
    and the Federal Judicial Center in consultation with this and other Conference
    committees. The Committee also discussed the federalism implications of
    proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 502, which seeks to address problems
    with subject-matter waiver, inadvertent disclosure, enforceability of
    confidentiality orders, and selective waiver.


COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Financial Disclosure reported that as of July 6,
    2006, the Committee had received 3,745 financial disclosure reports and
    certifications for calendar year 2005, including 1,209 reports and
    certifications from Supreme Court justices, Article III judges, and judges of
    special courts; 333 reports from bankruptcy judges; 508 reports from
    magistrate judges; and 1,695 reports from judicial employees. The
    Committee also provided an update on the judiciary’s legislative initiative to
    have the Judicial Conference’s authority to redact sensitive information from
    financial disclosure reports restored. That authority, which was contained in
    5 U.S.C. app. § 105(b)(3)(E), expired on December 31, 2005. The Committee
    also reported that in response to recent media attention, on May 16, 2006, its
    chair sent a memorandum to all judges reminding them of their obligation to
    report educational trips and seminars reimbursed or paid for by private
    educational or nonprofit organizations.

              COMMITTEE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
                      LONG RANGE PLAN FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

                              Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 612 and on recommendation of the Committee
                      on Information Technology, the Judicial Conference approved the fiscal year
                      2007 update to the Long Range Plan for Information Technology in the
                      Federal Judiciary. Funds for the judiciary’s information technology program
                      will be spent in accordance with this plan.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Information Technology reported that as part of its
                      ongoing efforts to identify and implement more cost-effective service delivery
                      models, it approved the consolidation of servers for the Probation/Pretrial
                      Services Automated Case Tracking System (PACTS) and plans to review
                      recommendations regarding Financial Accounting System for Tomorrow
                      (FAS4T), Lotus Notes e-mail, and Jury Management System (JMS) servers.
                      The Committee endorsed limited access to the judiciary’s Data
                      Communications Network for the United States Tax Court, the United States
                      Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the United States Court of Appeals
                      for Veterans Claims, and the Rules Committees’ official reporters and
                      consultants. The Committee also discussed available mechanisms to reduce
                      the amount of unwelcome e-mail, also known as “spam,” and endorsed efforts
                      by the Administrative Office to implement measures at the national gateways
                      to limit the amount of spam.


            COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that during the
                      period from January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2006, a total of 63 intercircuit
                      assignments, undertaken by 45 Article III judges, were processed and
                      recommended by the Committee and approved by the Chief Justice. The
                      Committee continued to disseminate information about intercircuit
                      assignments to increase awareness and facilitate the use of visiting judges and
                      regularly aided courts requesting assistance by identifying and obtaining
                      judges willing to take assignments.

COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL RELATIONS
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

           The Committee on International Judicial Relations reported on its
    involvement in rule of law and judicial reform activities throughout the world,
    highlighting those in Albania, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Korea, the
    Russian Federation, and Ukraine. The Committee completed its work with
    the American Bar Association on a U.S. Department of State-funded project
    on judicial integrity involving Albania, Indonesia, and Kenya.


COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
    JUDICIAL SURVIVORS’ ANNUITIES SYSTEM

            Tax Treatment of Judges’ Contributions. Currently, judges’
    contributions to the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities System (JSAS) are made
    after federal, state, and local taxes have been deducted from the judges’
    paychecks. On recommendation of the Committee on the Judicial Branch, the
    Judicial Conference agreed to seek legislation that would provide for judges’
    contributions to JSAS to be made using pre-tax instead of after-tax dollars.

            Annuity Benefit Levels. In response to indications that some judges
    would be willing to pay, out-of-pocket, for a higher level of JSAS benefits,
    the Committee recommended that the Conference seek legislation to allow
    judges to voluntarily increase their contributions to JSAS in order to increase
    their survivors’ annuities. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
    recommendation.


    TRAVEL REGULATIONS FOR UNITED STATES
    JUSTICES AND JUDGES

            Evacuation, Safe Haven, and Other Special Allowances. The Judicial
    Conference approved an amendment to the Travel Regulations for United
    States Justices and Judges, recommended by the Committee, to establish a
    permanent policy on the payment of evacuation, safe haven, or other special
    allowances to judges in the event of a disaster. Such a policy will enable
    courts to promptly establish alternate work locations and resume normal court
    operations as early as possible in the wake of a disaster.

Judicial Conference of the United States

                              Judges with Special Needs. The judges’ travel regulations currently
                      allow the Director of the Administrative Office to authorize reimbursement
                      for travel and subsistence expenses for a family member or travel attendant to
                      accompany a judge with special needs, but not for the expense of personal
                      care services that may be provided by such an attendant. Noting that
                      executive branch travel regulations were recently amended to permit
                      reimbursement for the latter expenses, and that such reimbursement is both
                      necessary and appropriate, the Committee recommended, and the Conference
                      approved, an amendment to the judges’ travel regulations to authorize
                      payment for the services of an attendant traveling with a judge to
                      accommodate the judge’s special needs.


                      JUDGES’ ATTENDANCE AT PRIVATELY FUNDED
                      EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS

                              The Judicial Branch Committee recommended and, after discussion,
                      the Judicial Conference slightly modified and then approved a policy intended
                      to ensure greater transparency and accountability with regard to judges’
                      attendance at privately funded educational programs. The policy requires
                      non-government educational program providers (other than state and local bar
                      associations, subject-matter bar associations, judicial associations, the Judicial
                      Division of the American Bar Association, and the National Judicial College)
                      that wish to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by federal judges in
                      connection with attendance at programs whose significant purpose is the
                      education of federal or state judges, to disclose certain information about the
                      programs and their sources of funding. Providers are subject to the disclosure
                      requirements if they wish to reimburse or pay judges’ expenses above the
                      threshold amount at which judges must report reimbursements on their annual
                      financial disclosure reports (currently $305). Judges may not accept such
                      reimbursements unless they first ascertain that the program providers have
                      made the required disclosures, and they must report their attendance within 30
                      days of the conclusion of the program. Both the seminar provider disclosures
                      about programs and the judges’ disclosures about attendance at programs will
                      be publicly available on the internet. The policy becomes effective January 1,
                      2007.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that it continues to
                      actively address problems confronting the judiciary, including the inadequacy

    of judicial compensation and survivors’ benefits. The Committee is also
    taking steps to enhance communications between the judiciary and Congress
    and the media. These activities, combined with the Committee’s development
    of a policy that addresses the issue of judges’ attendance at privately funded
    educational programs, are intended to further the broader objective of
    maintaining and improving judicial independence.


COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES
    STAFFING FORMULAS

            At the request of the Committee on Judicial Resources, the
    Administrative Office conducted a review of the district and bankruptcy
    clerks’ offices staffing formulas adopted in September 2004 (JCUS-SEP 04,
    pp. 20-21), to assess the impact of the CM/ECF system and other innovations
    that may have led to efficiencies and increased effectiveness in the judiciary,
    and to address concerns raised by the Administrative Office’s District Clerks
    Advisory Group with regard to the district clerk’s office staffing formula.
    Based on that review, the Committee recommended, and the Conference
    approved, new staffing formulas for district and bankruptcy clerks’ offices, to
    be implemented in fiscal year 2007. The district clerk’s office formula will be
    revisited in two years and the bankruptcy clerk’s office formula will be
    reassessed on a somewhat shorter cycle to take into account changes in
    bankruptcy clerk’s office procedures resulting from passage of the Bankruptcy
    Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.


    COURT-SIZING FORMULAS

             Court-sizing formulas are used to determine the appropriate grades and
    salaries of court unit executives, including district and bankruptcy clerks of
    court, and by extension, chief deputy clerks. The court-sizing formulas for
    district and bankruptcy clerks take into account the numbers of court unit
    employees based on 100 percent of the relevant staffing formulas, as well as
    the number of authorized judgeships. Since the new staffing formula for
    bankruptcy clerks’ offices will result in a decrease in staffing allocations for
    some courts, the Committee recommended that the Conference approve
    technical adjustments to the court-sizing formula for bankruptcy clerks of
    court, so that their grades are not adversely affected solely by virtue of
    implementation of the new staffing formula. As in the past, adjustments to
    court unit executive grades will continue to follow increases and decreases in

                      workload. The Committee also recommended that the Conference delegate to
                      the Committee on Judicial Resources the authority to make such technical
                      adjustments to any court-sizing formulas in the future, as needed, when the
                      respective staffing formulas are revised. The Conference adopted the
                      Committee’s recommendations.


                      COMPENSATION COST-CONTAINMENT INITIATIVES

                              In 2004, the Executive Committee asked the Committee on Judicial
                      Resources to consider cost-containment initiatives that could be implemented
                      in fiscal year 2005 and beyond. Among the short-term actions taken to
                      contain compensation costs was the elimination of funding for the longevity
                      bonus program1 and for new positions for the swing pool secretarial program2
                      for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. At this session, the Judicial Conference
                      approved the Committee’s recommendations to continue the suspension of the
                      longevity bonus program pending completion of a court compensation study
                      currently underway, and to eliminate permanently centralized funding of new
                      and/or replacement positions for the swing pool secretary program, for all
                      court units.


                      TEMPORARY EMERGENCY FUND

                              The Temporary Emergency Fund (TEF) provides money to circuit
                      judicial councils for temporary staffing emergencies in chambers. The funds
                      may also be reprogrammed for use in tenant alterations. The funds have been
                      distributed to the circuits each year based on the number of authorized
                      judgeships in each circuit, with 5 percent held in reserve and managed by the
                      Administrative Office. In response to concerns that TEF funding levels have
                      been declining in recent years and are not sufficient to address the need for
                      emergency personnel in some courts, the Committee recommended that the



             1
              Under the longevity bonus program, employees who are at the top step of a salary
             range are eligible for a 1 percent cash bonus on an annual basis if certain criteria are
             met.
             2
              The swing pool secretary program was established to provide secretarial assistance
             to judges for short periods of time when hiring a temporary replacement for principal
             secretarial staff would not be feasible.

Conference approve the allocation of all TEF funding to the circuit judicial
councils without maintaining a 5 percent reserve. The Committee further
recommended that the Conference stress the importance of using these funds
for staff, rather than alterations. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
recommendations.


LAW CLERK QUALIFICATIONS

        In recent years, the Judicial Conference expanded the qualification
standards for “elbow” law clerks to allow experience as a pro se law clerk or
as a staff attorney to be considered as equivalent to elbow law clerk
experience for purposes of establishing the grade level for elbow law clerks
(JCUS-SEP 03, p. 28; JCUS-MAR 04, p. 20). Since there appears to be no
reason to distinguish bankruptcy appellate panel law clerk experience for
these purposes, at this session the Committee recommended that the
Conference approve an expansion of the qualification standards for elbow law
clerks to consider bankruptcy appellate panel law clerk experience as
creditable for purposes of establishing grade eligibility. The Conference
adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

         In March 1998, the Judicial Conference approved “basic” and “robust”
staffing factors for clerk’s office positions performing duties related to
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) (JCUS-MAR 98, pp. 20-21). The basic
staffing factor was intended to apply to most district courts’ ADR programs,
while the robust factor was intended for a limited number of courts with
extensive ADR programs. Based on the number of cases participating in the
ADR programs in the Central District of California and the Middle District of
Pennsylvania, and on the number of hours spent processing these cases, the
Committee recommended that the Conference approve the requests of those
districts for application of the robust staffing factor for clerk’s office positions
with duties related to ADR. The Conference approved the Committee’s
recommendations.

                      COURT INTERPRETERS

                              Based on established criteria, the Committee on Judicial Resources
                      recommended, and the Judicial Conference approved, one additional Spanish
                      staff court interpreter position for fiscal year 2008 for the Western District of
                      Texas, and accelerated funding for that position in fiscal year 2007. On the
                      Committee’s recommendation, the Conference declined to approve two
                      additional Spanish staff court interpreter positions for the District of New
                      Mexico.


                      FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

                              On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
                      approved changing the date for submission of The Judiciary Fair Employment
                      Practices Annual Report from the March to the September session of the
                      Judicial Conference by amending the last sentence of the Conference’s
                      resolution on equal employment opportunity (see JCUS-MAR 80, p. 5). This
                      will allow the Administrative Office sufficient time to complete the complex,
                      multi-step process required to produce the detailed report.

                      action planning for the judiciary’s human resources program. The Committee
                      also endorsed the establishment by the Administrative Office of a group, with
                      representatives from all court unit types, to study the “core modeling”
                      methodology for use in work measurement and to prepare a report to be

            Senior Judge Participation. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 631(a) and the
    Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United States Establishing
    Standards and Procedures for the Appointment and Reappointment of United
    States Magistrate Judges, magistrate judges are currently selected by majority
    vote of the active district judges of a court from a list provided by a merit
    selection panel. An amendment to the Senate’s version of the proposed
    Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611, 109th Cong.)
    would specifically confer on senior judges the right to vote on the
    appointment of magistrate judges in their districts. Noting that the current
    method of appointment is effective, the Committee on the Administration of
    the Magistrate Judges System recommended that the Conference oppose the
    amendment. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

            Electronic Publication of Notices. In light of the ready availability and
    low cost of electronic publication of notices, the Committee recommended,
    and the Judicial Conference approved, amendments to Sections 2.01 and
    6.03(a) of the Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United States
    Establishing Standards and Procedures for the Appointment and
    Reappointment of United States Magistrate Judges to require wide circulation
    of magistrate judge position vacancy announcements and notices of
    consideration of reappointments, and to make publication of such notices
    through print advertisements in local newspapers and legal periodicals
    optional rather than required. Similar revisions were made to the selection
    and appointment regulations for bankruptcy judges in March 2006 and at this
    Conference session (see JCUS-MAR 06, pp. 9-10 and “Selection and
    Appointment Regulations,” supra, p. 8).

                      ACCELERATED FUNDING

                             On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges
                      System reported that pursuant to Judicial Conference policy regarding the
                      review of magistrate judge position vacancies (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 26), the
                      Committee determined that vacancies in four district courts should be filled.
                      The Committee approved an initiative to automate the list of retired magistrate
                      judges who are willing and available to serve on recall and to post the list on
                      the J-Net so that it can be viewed by chief judges and other court personnel
                      seeking the services of a recalled magistrate judge. The Committee
                      considered statistics on the gender and ethnic diversity of magistrate judges
                      and agreed that the chair will send a letter to each court that receives approval
                      to fill a magistrate judge position vacancy to urge the court to consider the
                      importance of diversity in the magistrate judge appointment process.


             COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
                      RULES IMPLEMENTING THE E-GOVERNMENT ACT

                              To implement the E-Government Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 107-347),
                      the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the Judicial
                      Conference a proposed amendment to Appellate Rule 25 (Filing and Service),
                      and proposed new Bankruptcy Rule 9037 (Privacy Protection for Filings
                      Made with the Court), Civil Rule 5.2 (Privacy Protection for Filings Made
                      with the Court), and Criminal Rule 49.1 (Privacy Protection for Filings Made
                      with the Court), together with Committee Notes explaining their purpose and
                      intent. The Act requires the Supreme Court to prescribe rules “to protect
                      privacy and security concerns relating to electronic filing of documents and
                      the public availability . . . of documents filed electronically.” The proposed
                      amendment and new rules are based on Judicial Conference policy regarding
                      the redaction of certain personal information from court filings (JCUS-
                      SEP/OCT 01, pp. 48-50; JCUS-SEP 03, pp. 15-16). The Judicial Conference

approved the amendment and new rules and authorized their transmittal to the
Supreme Court for its consideration with a recommendation that they be
adopted by the Court and transmitted to Congress in accordance with the law.


FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE

regarding a proposed amendment to Appellate Rule 25 (Filing and Service).


FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE

        The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
Judicial Conference proposed amendments to Bankruptcy Rules 1014
(Dismissal and Change of Venue), 3007 (Objections to Claims), 4001 (Relief
from Automatic Stay; Prohibiting or Conditioning the Use, Sale, or Lease of
Property; Use of Cash Collateral; Obtaining Credit; Agreements), 6006
(Assumption, Rejection or Assignment of an Executory Contract or
Unexpired Lease), and 7007.1 (Corporate Ownership Statement), and
proposed new Bankruptcy Rules 6003 (Interim and Final Relief Immediately
Following the Commencement of the Case — Applications for Employment;
Motions for Use, Sale, or Lease of Property; and Motions for Assumption or
Assignment of Executory Contracts), and 9005.1 (Constitutional Challenge to
a Statute — Notice, Certification, and Intervention), together with Committee

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION
AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2005

        Following passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 (the Act), the Executive Committee, acting on behalf
of the Judicial Conference, authorized distribution to the courts of proposed
interim bankruptcy rules that could be adopted in individual districts by local


                                      33
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      rule or general order to facilitate uniform practice under the Act, pending
                      amendment of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (JCUS-SEP 05,
                      p. 5). At this session, the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure
                      proposed an amendment to Interim Bankruptcy Rule 1007 with a
                      recommendation that it be distributed to the courts and adopted by standing
                      order or local rule to take effect on October 1, 2006. The proposed
                      amendment addresses problems arising from the debtor’s obligation to file a
                      certificate showing completion of a credit counseling course prior to
                      commencing a bankruptcy case, by providing debtors a 15-day grace period
                      within which to file the certificate. The Committee also submitted proposed
                      revisions to Official Forms 1, 5, 6, 9, 22A, 22C, and 23, and new Exhibit D to
                      Official Form 1, which include revisions implementing the proposed
                      amendment to Interim Rule 1007 and new statistical reporting requirements
                      mandated by the Act. The Judicial Conference approved distributing to the
                      courts the amendment to Interim Rule 1007 and approved the revisions to the
                      Official Forms. The effective date of the revised Official Forms is October 1,
                      2006.


                      FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

                              The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                      Conference a proposed comprehensive style revision of Civil Rules 1-86 and
                      the Illustrative Forms contained in the Appendix of Forms of the Federal
                      Rules of Civil Procedure, to clarify and simplify them without changing their
                      substantive meaning. Similar revisions have already been made to the Federal
                      Rules of Appellate Procedure (JCUS-SEP 97, p. 82) and the Federal Rules of
                      Criminal Procedure (JCUS-SEP/OCT 01, p. 70). The Committee also
                      proposed minor substantive amendments to proposed restyled Civil Rules 4
                      (Summons), 9 (Pleading Special Matters), 11 (Signing of Pleadings, Motions,
                      and Other Papers; Representations to Court; Sanctions), 14 (Third-Party
                      Practice), 16 (Pretrial Conferences; Scheduling; Management), 26 (General
                      Provisions Governing Discovery; Duty of Disclosure), 30 (Depositions Upon
                      Oral Examination), 31 (Depositions Upon Written Questions), 40
                      (Assignment of Cases for Trial), 71.1 (Condemning Real or Personal
                      Property), and 78 (Motion Day). Finally, the Committee proposed style
                      changes to pending amendments (scheduled to take effect in December 2006)
                      to Civil Rules 5.1 (Constitutional Challenge to a Statute — Notice,
                      Certification, and Intervention), 33 (Interrogatories to Parties), 34 (Production
                      of Documents, Electronically Stored Information, and Things and Entry Upon
                      Land for Inspection and Other Purposes), 37 (Failure to Make Disclosure or

Rulings) and to proposed new Civil Rule 5.2 (Privacy Protection for Filings
Made with the Court) (see supra “Rules Implementing the E-Government
Act,” pp. 32-33). The Judicial Conference approved the amendments and
authorized their transmittal to the Supreme Court for its consideration with a
recommendation that they be adopted by the Court and transmitted to
Congress in accordance with the law.


FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

        The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
Judicial Conference proposed amendments to Criminal Rules 11 (Pleas), 32
(Sentencing and Judgment), 35 (Correcting or Reducing a Sentence), and 45
(Computing and Extending Time), together with Committee Notes explaining
their purpose and intent, and a recommendation to abrogate the form entitled,
“Model Form for Use in 28 U.S.C. § 2254 Cases Involving a Rule 9 Issue”
contained in the Appendix of Forms to the Rules Governing Section 2254
Cases in the United States District Courts. The Judicial Conference approved
the amendments and the recommendation to abrogate the model form and
authorized their transmittal to the Supreme Court for its consideration with a
recommendation that they be adopted by the Court and transmitted to
Congress in accordance with the law. See also supra “Rules Implementing
the E-Government Act,” pp. 32-33, regarding a proposed new Criminal
Rule 49.1 (Privacy Protection for Filings Made with the Court).


COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

        The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure reported that it
approved for publication proposed amendments and additions to the Federal
Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and Official Forms to implement the
Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The
proposed changes are based substantially on the interim rules, modified as
appropriate after considering comments from the bench and bar as a result of
the use of the interim rules. The Committee also approved for publication
proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and a new
Criminal Rule, as well as a proposed new Federal Rule of Evidence. The
comment period expires on February 15, 2007.

Judicial Conference of the United States

             COMMITTEE ON SPACE AND FACILITIES
                      U.S. COURTS DESIGN GUIDE

                              As part of the judiciary’s long-term cost-containment strategy, the
                      Committee on Space and Facilities has been conducting a comprehensive
                      review of the U.S. Courts Design Guide to identify revisions that would
                      reduce costs without affecting functionality. Revisions pertaining to court
                      office space and chambers suites, as well as certain technical revisions, have
                      already been adopted (JCUS-SEP 05, pp. 39-40; JCUS-MAR 06, pp. 28-29).
                      In continuation of this effort, the Conference took the following actions with
                      regard to Committee recommendations concerning the Design Guide:

                      a.       Agreed, after discussion, to apply the standards of the new 2007
                               edition of the U.S. Courts Design Guide to the design and construction
                               of new buildings and annexes, all new leases, and repair and alteration
                               projects where new space, including courtrooms and chambers, is
                               planned for an entire court unit;

                      b.       Agreed, after discussion, to amend the Design Guide to state that when
                               designing for new construction, the court must adopt a palette of
                               finishes as the new building standard and apply that standard to all
                               future renovation projects in that courthouse;

                      c.       Adopted a policy that once a courtroom configuration is agreed upon
                               by a court, that layout will be the standard courtroom configuration for
                               that judge type in that project, and changes to the standard courtroom
                               configuration will be included among the exceptions that must be
                               approved by the Committee on Space and Facilities, or the Judicial
                               Conference, as appropriate;

                      d.       Adopted a policy that a circuit judicial council must specifically
                               approve any attorney lounge for a district or bankruptcy court;

                      e.       Endorsed a standard that provides a separate dining area for judges
                               only when a cafeteria is planned for that building;

                      f.       Agreed to require, with regard to access or raised flooring, that (a) the
                               floor finish facilitate access to the underfloor cabling and wiring
                               without complete removal and replacement of floor covering; and
                               (b) high quality carpet tile, vinyl composition tile (for high traffic or
                               utility spaces such as computer rooms), “quick release” nonadhesive

                                                              36
                                                              September 19, 2006

       carpet strips, or “quick release” adhesive broadloom carpet be used as
       the floor finish or covering;

g.     Declined to approve sample floor plans for appellate, district,
       bankruptcy, and magistrate judge courtrooms that depict ramps as the
       preferred method to accommodate persons with disabilities; and

h.     Approved a number of technical revisions to the Design Guide
       pertaining to shared support space, CM/ECF space, mechanical
       systems, ceiling heights, and lighting.


BUDGET CHECK PROCESS

        A budget check process was adopted by the Judicial Conference in
September 2004 as a space cost-control mechanism and is applicable to all
prospectus and non-prospectus space actions (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 35-36). At
this session, the Committee recommended, and the Conference adopted, the
following with respect to budget checks:

a.     the budget check process is applicable to requests from the General
       Services Administration (GSA) for input into feasibility studies; and

b.     with regard to chambers space requests for judges taking senior status
       or for their replacements needed within the next 24 months, the budget
       check process is streamlined as follows: Circuit judicial councils will
       conduct a budget analysis jointly with the Administrative Office with
       review by the Committee on Space and Facilities, prior to transmitting
       any space request to GSA. Requests for courtrooms associated with
       these judges will be subject to the regular budget check process.

        The Committee also recommended that the projects in Greenville,
South Carolina; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; San Antonio, Texas; San Jose,
California; and Anniston, Alabama, which already have authorization from
Congress to begin design and are therefore not subject to the budget check
process, proceed with the following conditions: they will incorporate all
approved revisions to the U.S. Courts Design Guide, they will not exceed the
amount of square footage authorized by Congress for the judiciary in the
projects, including the specific number of courtrooms and chambers, and the
rent resulting upon the completion of these projects will be charged against
the future annual rent budget caps (see supra “Rent Budget Cap,” p. 10). The
Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.

                              In addition, the Conference adopted a Committee recommendation to
                      approve exceptions to the budget check process for non-prospectus space
                      projects in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico; Port Huron, Michigan; Jackson,
                      Tennessee; and Las Cruces, New Mexico, on the condition that the projects be
                      funded from the local or circuit council tenant alterations funds and any
                      additional rent that will be accrued because of the alteration will be charged
                      against the circuit councils’ future space rental caps.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Space and Facilities reported that it is continuing to
                      test the new long-range facilities planning methodology called asset
                      management planning as a cost-containment initiative. Another such
                      initiative, the rent validation project, which involves reviewing space
                      assignments, GSA rent charges, appraisals, and rental rates, will be completed
                      within one year.


             MEMORIAL RESOLUTIONS
                             The Judicial Conference approved the following resolutions noting the
                      deaths of the Honorable Edward R. Becker of the Third Circuit Court of
                      Appeals and the Honorable Howard T. Markey, who had served on the
                      Federal Circuit Court of Appeals:

                                       The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with
                               profound sadness the death of the Honorable Edward R.
                               Becker of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
                               Circuit, on Friday, May 19, 2006, in Philadelphia,
                               Pennsylvania. Judge Becker’s very distinguished career on the
                               federal bench spanned nearly 36 years, beginning in 1970 with
                               an appointment, at age 37, to the United States District Court
                               for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He became an
                               appellate judge in 1982 and served as chief judge of his circuit
                               and, therefore, a member of this body from 1998 to 2003. As a
                               senior judge, he continued to perform valuable service until
                               shortly before his death.

                                       During his lengthy tenure, Judge Becker made
                               significant and enduring contributions to federal judicial
                               administration, both in his own circuit and at the national level.

                                                              38
                                                        September 19, 2006

In 1979, he was appointed by Chief Justice Warren Burger to
what is now known as the Judicial Conference Committee on
Criminal Law, where he served for 11 years, including 3 years
as committee chair. Recognizing his keen analytical abilities,
broad knowledge of the judicial process and judiciary
programs, and remarkable work ethic, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist called upon Judge Becker in 1990 to serve for nearly
five and a half years on the Committee on Long Range
Planning, where he played a leading role in producing the
judiciary’s first comprehensive long-range plan. At
approximately the same time he served a four-year term on the
Board of the Federal Judicial Center, which benefitted from his
renowned pragmatism and efficiency as well as many years of
judging experience. Soon after he became a Conference
member, Chief Justice Rehnquist asked him to serve on the
Executive Committee, a forum in which his customary energy
and creativity were brought to bear on the problems of the
judiciary as a whole.

       While devoting considerable time to administrative
matters, Judge Becker was also a towering legal scholar,
responsible for many influential rulings that often anticipated
changes in the law later adopted by the Supreme Court. In
recognition of his numerous contributions to the law and the
administration of justice, the American Judicature Society
bestowed upon him the 20th annual Edward J. Devitt
Distinguished Service to Justice Award in 2002.

         A man of high principle and unquestioned integrity,
Judge Becker was admired not only for his superior intellect
and powerful decisions, but also his great courage, ceaseless
determination, personal humility, and respect for all persons no
matter their station in life. He earned the esteem and affection
of everyone with whom he worked, was widely revered as a
leader, counselor, and friend, and was well-known for a
musical talent that he loved to share. The nation has lost one
of its finest jurists, and we have lost a dear colleague with
whom it was an occasional privilege to “charge up San Juan
Hill.” We will long remember Edward Becker and honor his
plentiful achievements.

                                      As a sign of their affection and respect, the members of
                               the Judicial Conference convey their deepest sympathies to

                                                             ***

                                       With profound sadness, the Judicial Conference of the
                               United States notes the death of the Honorable Howard T.
                               Markey, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Customs
                               and Patent Appeals from 1972 to 1982, and then Chief Judge of
                               the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from
                               its inception (in 1982) until 1990. He served with great
                               distinction and the widespread acclaim of judges from
                               throughout the judiciary until his retirement to academia in
                               1991.

                                       Chief Judge Markey was a giant of the federal
                               judiciary; while he was ably leading both courts, he was also
                               shaping the course of judicial administration of the entire Third
                               Branch. By the end of his tenure, he was the senior member of
                               the Judicial Conference, having served from 1972 to 1990. For
                               many years, he chaired the committee now called the
                               Committee on Codes of Conduct. In this capacity, he wrote
                               many of the leading opinions construing and applying
                               in particular cases the ethical canons applicable to federal
                               judicial officers. He also served on the Executive Committee
                               and the Committee on Court Administration, and he chaired
                               the Committee on the Bicentennial of the Constitution and the
                               Ad Hoc Committee on the International Appellate Judges
                               Conference of 1989/90.

                                       Although the chief judge of a busy court with numerous
                               areas of jurisdiction, he nevertheless sat repeatedly with all
                               other courts of appeals around the country. He is believed
                               to be the only judge to have sat with every regional circuit. In
                               addition, he carried a full caseload with his court, sitting more
                               often than any other active judge on the Federal Circuit.

                                      Chief Judge Markey led his two courts with
                               extraordinary energy and efficiency, frequently returning a
                               portion of the annual appropriation by the Congress to the U.S.
                               Treasury. He led a lean court in which each judge had only


                                                              40
                                                                  September 19, 2006

           two law clerks. He lived out the motto posted in his chambers
           which read, “The best possible decision, in the shortest
           possible time, at the least possible cost.”

                   Throughout his Judicial Conference, Conference
           committee, and court service, Chief Judge Markey was a
           forceful and renowned judicial leader, who rightly earned the
           respect of fellow judges, lawyers, and other persons with
           whom he dealt. A larger-than-life personality, he is well
           remembered by many for his endless store of jokes, fascinating
           anecdotes and instructive stories, as well as for his Irish wit
           and charm. He inspired his colleagues, and many others.
           In 1998, in recognition of his many judicial achievements, the
           National Courts Building was renamed by Act of Congress the
           “Howard T. Markey National Courts Building.” America has
           lost an extraordinary patriot, jurist, and judicial leader. Many
           have lost a good friend.

                   As a sign of their admiration, affection and deep respect
           the members of the Judicial Conference wish to convey their
           heartfelt sympathies to Chief Judge Markey’s surviving family,
           especially his sister, Catherine; sons, Jeffrey and Christopher;
           and daughter, Jennifer.
