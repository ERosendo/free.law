                      on the Judicial Branch, reported on the current judicial pay restoration

             ELECTIONS
                              The Judicial Conference elected to the Board of the Federal Judicial
                      Center, each for a term of four years, Judge David O. Carter of the District
                      Court for the Central District of California to succeed Judge James A. Parker

             EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
                      JUDICIAL COMPENSATION

                              In order to address a crisis in judges’ compensation, highlighted in
                      Chief Justice Roberts’ 2006 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, the
                      Committee on the Judicial Branch recommended that the Judicial Conference
                      endorse “an immediate and substantial increase in judicial salaries.” Because
                      of the current interest in Congress in considering judicial pay legislation, the
                      Executive Committee approved the recommendation on behalf of the
                      Conference on an expedited basis. This revised policy statement supersedes
                      the Conference’s more specific endorsement of a 16.5 percent increase in
                      judicial salaries (see JCUS-SEP 03, p. 27). The new formulation takes into
                      account the continuing decline in real judicial compensation, affords the
                      judiciary flexibility to pursue a pay raise that more fully meets its needs, and
                      accommodates the interests of the other two branches of government.

FIVE-YEAR SELF-EVALUATION AND
JURISDICTIONAL REVIEW

         Every five years, each committee of the Judicial Conference must
recommend to the Executive Committee, with a justification, whether it
should be maintained or abolished (JCUS-SEP 87, p. 60). Pursuant to this
mandate, each committee completed and submitted to the Executive
Committee for consideration at the latter’s February 2007 meeting a self-
evaluation questionnaire, which expressed the committee’s views about its
continuation, mission, functions, and structure. The Executive Committee
made no changes to the committee structure itself, but tentatively agreed to
make revisions to the jurisdictional statements of the following committees
(largely based on suggestions of the committees themselves): Committee on
Codes of Conduct, Committee on Defender Services, Committee on Judicial
Security, Committee to Review Circuit Council Conduct and Disability
Orders, and Committee on Space and Facilities. The changes were either
technical or clarifying or made explicit a responsibility for subject areas that
the committee already handled. In addition, at the request of the Committee
to Review Circuit Council Conduct and Disability Orders, the Executive
Committee agreed to change the name of that committee and determined that
it be called the “Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability.” Chairs were
provided an additional opportunity for comment, and revisions were made
final in March 2007.


CONFERENCE-APPROVED LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

        Every two years, at the beginning of a new Congress, each Conference
committee considers Conference-endorsed legislative proposals within its
jurisdiction that have not yet been enacted to determine whether the judiciary
should pursue those proposals in the new Congress. At its February 2007
meeting, the Executive Committee reviewed the determinations of other
committees as to which legislative proposals should be pursued in the 110th
Congress. In addition, the Committee reviewed the one proposal within its
own jurisdiction—establishment of a Judicial Conference Foundation
to receive and expend private contributions in support of official programs
(JCUS-MAR 95, p. 6)—and determined not to pursue the proposal in the
present Congress.

                               section 1043 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended by section 418
                               of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (Pub. L. No. 109-432,
                               div. A); and

                                                               6

    •      Made referrals to Conference committees as follows: (a) asked the
           Committee on Court Administration and Case Management to
           consider the adequacy of juror attendance fees and to explore
           measures with regard to the summoning of potential jurors that could
           make jury service less burdensome and more cost-effective; (b) asked
           the Judicial Resources Committee to consider issues related to court
           reporters; (c) asked the Committee on Codes of Conduct to develop
           illustrative standards, criteria, or examples to guide judges in making
           recusal decisions related to attendance at privately funded educational
           seminars; (d) asked the Committee on Financial Disclosure to consider
           consolidation, simplification, or clarification of the multiple,
           overlapping reporting requirements imposed on judges who attend
           such seminars; and (e) asked the Committee on Judicial Conduct and
           Disability to address implementation of the report of the Chief
           Justice’s Judicial Conduct and Disability Act Study Committee (see
           infra, “Judicial Conduct and Disability Act Study Committee Report,”
           pp. 19-20).


COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
    WIRETAP REPORTS

            The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.
    § 2519, requires the Administrative Office to report to Congress annually the
    number, nature, and disposition of federal and state applications for orders
    approving the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications
    (wiretap orders), based on reports submitted to it by federal and state judges
    and the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice is seeking
    legislation to extend its statutory deadline for reporting data on wiretap orders
    to the Administrative Office, stating that the current deadline leaves it
    insufficient time to provide accurate data. On recommendation of the
    Committee, the Conference agreed to support the Department of Justice in
    securing such an extension provided that the legislation include a
    commensurate extension of the judiciary’s deadline for submitting the annual
    wiretap report to Congress.

Judicial Conference of the United States



                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that it discussed
                      the results of a survey the AO conducted in 2006 of Judicial Conference
                      members, committee chairs, chief judges, court unit executives,
                      and federal defenders, which was intended to assist the AO in focusing on the
                      judiciary’s most important issues and requirements. The Committee will
                      participate in an internal review Director Duff is conducting of the AO’s
                      structure and services. The Committee discussed at length its key role in the
                      judiciary’s system for oversight and review, including its oversight of the
                      AO’s audit, review, and investigation services.


             COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
             OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

                      ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

                              Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 152(b), the Judicial Conference submits
                      periodic recommendations for new bankruptcy judgeships to Congress. In
                      March 1991, the Conference adopted a policy that provides for a national
                      survey of judgeship needs every two years and establishes criteria for
                      evaluating requests for additional bankruptcy judgeships (JCUS-MAR 91,
                      pp. 12-13). Based on the 2006 biennial survey of judgeship needs, the
                      Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System recommended
                      that the Judicial Conference authorize the Administrative Office to transmit to
                      Congress proposed legislation to create three additional bankruptcy
                      judgeships for the Eastern District of Michigan and one for the Northern
                      District of Mississippi, and to convert one existing temporary position to
                      permanent in each of the following districts: Eastern District of Michigan,
                      Southern District of Georgia, Southern District of Illinois, and Western
                      District of Tennessee. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendations. Because the long-term impact of the Bankruptcy Abuse
                      Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-8) on
                      bankruptcy filings is not yet known, the Committee will monitor filing levels
                      and initiate a new survey at the end of 2007, if warranted.

    CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE COMPENSATION

            In September 1991, the Judicial Conference agreed to seek legislation
    to ensure that trustees who serve in cases converted to chapter 7 of the
    Bankruptcy Code receive compensation equivalent to that received by trustees
    serving in cases originally filed under chapter 7 (JCUS-SEP 91, p. 53).
    Subsequently, the Judicial Conference amended the Bankruptcy Court
    Miscellaneous Fee Schedule to provide for full compensation to chapter 7
    trustees in cases converted from other chapters of the Code (JCUS-SEP 06,
    p. 14). Since the goal of the 1991 position has been achieved, on
    recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to rescind its 1991
    position to seek legislation.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Bankruptcy Committee reported that it decided to study further a
    request by the Director of the Executive Office for United States Trustees for
    Judicial Conference approval of the mandatory use of data-enabled forms. It
    also decided, as a long-range planning matter, to monitor the current
    Administrative Services Methods Analysis Program effort to identify and
    share information on best practices among the courts in performing various
    functions. In addition, the Committee discussed the involvement of
    bankruptcy judges on Judicial Conference committees and at Conference
    sessions, and received status reports on various topics, including recent
    activities of its Subcommittee on Fees and Revenue Enhancement, the
    Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules, the Administrative Office’s
    Bankruptcy Judges Advisory Group, and the Federal Judicial Center.


COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
    CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE PAYMENTS

           In March 2004, the Judicial Conference agreed to seek legislation to
    simplify the accounting procedures associated with chapter 7 trustee payments
    (JCUS-MAR 04, p. 8). Subsequently, it was determined that the desired
    modifications could be achieved without legislation. Therefore, on
    recommendation of the Budget Committee, the Conference rescinded its
    March 2004 position.

Judicial Conference of the United States



                      SALARIES AND EXPENSES ACCOUNT BUDGET CAP

                              In March 2006, the Judicial Conference approved, in concept, the
                      establishment of an annual budget cap on growth in space rental costs, and in
                      September 2006, set that cap at an average annual growth rate of 4.9 percent
                      for fiscal years 2009 through 2016 (JCUS-MAR 06, pp. 10-11; JCUS-SEP 06,
                      p. 10). At this session, the Conference adopted a recommendation of the
                      Budget Committee to set an overall cap on annual increases in the Salaries
                      and Expenses account for fiscal years 2009 through 2017 at an average of 8.2
                      percent over prior year appropriations. This cap will allow funding of
                      expenses classified as mandatory and hold rent to the 4.9 percent space cap;
                      discretionary elements in the account will have to be reduced accordingly to
                      bring requirements within the levels of the overall budget cap.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Budget reported that it continues to be
                      concerned about the long-term financial health of the judiciary and spent
                      considerable time discussing internal and external actions that will impact
                      future budgets. The Committee continues to view the judiciary's two-pronged
                      approach—congressional outreach and cost containment—as critical to
                      protecting the independence of the judiciary and securing adequate funding
                      from the Congress. To that end, the Committee remains steadfast in its desire
                      to implement budget caps for all of the judiciary’s major accounts including
                      Defender Services and Court Security.


             COMMITTEE ON CODES OF CONDUCT
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that since its last report
                      to the Judicial Conference in September 2006, the Committee received 43
                      new written inquiries and issued 43 written advisory responses. During this
                      period, the average response time for requests was 18 days. In addition, the
                      Committee chair received and responded to 43 informal inquiries from
                      colleagues, and individual Committee members responded to 192 such
                      inquiries.

COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
AND CASE MANAGEMENT

    COURTROOMS FOR SENIOR JUDGES

            In July 2006, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
    passed a resolution as part of its authorization of a courthouse construction
    project, directing the Judicial Conference to, among other things, revise the
    U.S. Courts Design Guide within one year to provide for one courtroom for
    every two senior judges in new construction projects. The Court
    Administration and Case Management Committee, in conjunction with the
    Space and Facilities Committee, recommended that the Conference take no
    action at this time on this portion of the resolution, with the understanding that
    the two Conference committees and the Administrative Office will continue to
    work with the House committee to address this issue in conjunction with an
    ongoing study of courtroom usage, and that the Space and Facilities
    Committee will be mindful of the resolution in reviewing proposed
    courthouse construction projects. The Conference adopted the Court
    Administration and Case Management Committee’s recommendation.


    PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

            Southern District of Iowa. The Southern District of Iowa recently
    relinquished its courtroom space in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and moved into a
    significantly smaller space as a cost-containment measure. The new space is
    sufficient for hearings and bench trials, but not for occasional civil jury trials.
    The District of Nebraska courthouse in Omaha is located five miles from
    Council Bluffs, and is convenient to the Southern District of Iowa jury pool
    and bar, and the District of Nebraska has agreed to allow the Southern District
    of Iowa to hold these civil trials in its Omaha courthouse. At the request of
    the Southern District of Iowa and on recommendation of the Committee, the
    Conference agreed to seek legislation to allow that district occasionally to
    hold civil trials upon party consent in Omaha, Nebraska, with the
    understanding that this legislative proposal will be narrowly tailored to fit the
    unique circumstances of the request.

           Western District of Texas. On recommendation of the Committee, the
    Conference rescinded its September 2003 endorsement of legislation to amend
    28 U.S.C. § 124(d) to move Hudspeth County from the Pecos Division to the
    El Paso Division of the Western District of Texas (see JCUS-SEP 03, p. 8) .

Judicial Conference of the United States

                      The Western District of Texas had advised the Committee that the change is
                      no longer necessary.


                      ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO DIGITAL AUDIO RECORDINGS

                               The Conference adopted a recommendation of the Committee to
                      endorse a pilot project in selected districts, for 6 to 12 months, to allow digital
                      audio recordings to be accessible through the Case Management/Electronic
                      Case Files (CM/ECF) system and to make them available to the public
                      through the judiciary’s Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER)
                      program. Such recordings are already available for purchase at clerks’
                      offices.


                      SEALED CASES AND DOCUMENTS

                              Noting that the CM/ECF system has a proven record of security and
                      success in managing sealed court records, the Committee recommended that
                      the Conference endorse the sealing functionality of the CM/ECF system and
                      encourage courts to use that functionality. The Committee also recommended
                      that the Conference strongly urge courts to ensure that, in response to queries
                      about sealed cases, the CM/ECF message reads “case under seal” rather than
                      “case does not exist.” The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendations.


                      ELECTRONIC TRANSCRIPTS POLICY

                              In September 2005, the Conference asked the Court Administration
                      and Case Management Committee to work with the Defender Services
                      Committee to evaluate the impact on the defender services program of the
                      judiciary’s policy concerning public access to electronic transcripts, and to
                      determine whether to recommend changes to the policy (JCUS-SEP 05,
                      p. 16). At this session, the Court Administration and Case Management
                      Committee, in consultation with the Defender Services Committee,
                      recommended revisions to that policy to clarify (a) the scope of an attorney’s
                      responsibility with regard to redacting personal identifying data from
                      electronic transcripts, (b) the role of standby counsel to pro se defendants in
                      the redaction process, (c) the scope of the “hold harmless” provision for
                      failure to redact or for redaction errors, to make clear that it includes
                      attorneys, and (d) issues relating to Criminal Justice Act panel attorney

                                                              12

    appointment, compensation, and reimbursement for performing duties
    required under the policy. The Conference approved the recommendation.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

             The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
    reported that it discussed the ongoing courtroom usage study, which is being
    conducted for the Committee by the FJC, and the Committee’s efforts to keep
    Congress fully informed on the study’s progress; its extensive work with the
    Space and Facilities Committee regarding the implementation of the
    Conference's criteria for recommending the closure of non-resident facilities
    (JCUS-MAR 06, p. 28); and its responsibilities relating to management of the
    judiciary's records. With regard to the last item, the Committee strongly
    supported the Administrative Office’s new initiative to create records
    disposition schedules for the courts’ electronic case files and the ongoing
    initiative to provide courts with the flexibility to destroy or retain all presently
    existing paper case files after they have been scanned into the courts’
    electronic dockets.


COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAW
    RE-ENTRY SERVICES

            The Director of the Administrative Office has explicit authority under
    18 U.S.C. § 3672 to contract for re-entry services for those federal offenders
    under post-conviction supervision who are dependent on alcohol and/or drugs
    or who suffer from a psychiatric disorder. In September 2005, the Judicial
    Conference agreed to seek legislation to expand that authorization to allow the
    Director to contract for services (e.g., medical, educational, emergency
    housing, and vocational training) and other re-entry interventions for
    post-conviction offenders generally (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 19). At this session,
    the Criminal Law Committee recommended that such legislation be expanded
    to cover individuals under pretrial supervision and also to include authority
    for the Director to expend funds for emergency re-entry services. Such
    authority would enhance probation and pretrial services officers’ ability to
    work with defendants and offenders re-entering the community. The
    Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                      SEPARATION OF JUDGMENT AND
                      STATEMENT OF REASONS

                              The judgment forms for criminal cases include an attached statement
                      of reasons, which sets forth the reasons a sentence was imposed. Because it
                      may include sensitive information about whether a defendant’s substantial
                      assistance served as a basis for the sentence, the statement of reasons is not
                      disclosed to the public (see JCUS-MAR 01, p. 17). The Prosecutorial
                      Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of
                      2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L. No. 108-21, amended 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) to
                      require that courts describe with specificity in the written judgment the
                      reasons relied on when departing from sentencing guidelines and amended 28
                      U.S.C. § 994(w) to require that a statement of reasons for the sentence
                      (including reasons for any departure) be submitted to the U.S. Sentencing
                      Commission. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of
                      2005, Pub. L. No. 109-177, further amended 28 U.S.C. § 994(w) to require
                      that the statement of reasons be submitted to the Sentencing Commission on
                      forms issued by the Judicial Conference and approved by the Sentencing
                      Commission. The consequence of these provisions is that the statement of
                      reasons form, which is neither available to the public nor locally modifiable,
                      would appear to be a required part of the judgment form, which is generally
                      available to the public and may be modified locally. To alleviate problems
                      this creates for clerks’ offices, on recommendation of the Committee, the
                      Conference agreed to seek legislation that would authorize the recording of
                      the statement of reasons in a document separate from the judgment form.


                      PROVISIONAL HIRING OF PROBATION AND
                      PRETRIAL SERVICES OFFICERS

                              Under a policy initiated in 1973, probation and pretrial services
                      officers could not be placed on the payroll prior to completion of a pre-
                      employment background investigation unless the AO Director determined that
                      an emergency situation required immediate appointment. In September 2002,
                      the Conference adopted a policy requiring background investigations and
                      checks in the courts for positions not already covered by previously approved
                      policies. As part of that policy, court unit executives and federal public
                      defenders were given authority to hire staff provisionally prior to completion
                      of the background check (JCUS-SEP 02, pp. 52-53). In order to alleviate
                      workload demands on district and AO staff without compromising the officer

    selection process, the Criminal Law Committee recommended that the
    Judicial Conference delegate to the chief judge of each district court authority
    similar to that now available to court unit executives and public defenders, to
    (a) waive the requirement that the initial background investigation of
    probation and pretrial services officers and officer assistants be completed
    prior to commencing employment; and (b) provisionally appoint probation
    officers and officer assistants and approve pretrial services officers and officer
    assistants, without prior approval of the Director of the Administrative Office,
    pending completion of the required background investigation. The
    Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Criminal Law reported that in November 2006,
    Judge Reggie Walton, a committee member, testified on behalf of the
    Conference before the United States Sentencing Commission about the impact
    on the administration of justice of the disparity between crack-cocaine and
    powder-cocaine sentences. He cited the Conference policy supporting the
    reduction of the disparity (see JCUS-SEP 06, p. 18), emphasizing the
    importance of ensuring both that justice is served and that the public
    appearance of justice is preserved. The Committee reviewed the existing
    Conference policy on searches and seizures conducted by probation officers,
    and is considering the implications of updating the policy. At the request of
    the Committee, staff in the Administrative Office convened a meeting of
    representatives of the AO, the Sentencing Commission, the Bureau of Prisons,
    the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Immigration and
    Customs Enforcement to discuss the viability of automating the transmission
    of sentencing documents.


COMMITTEE ON DEFENDER SERVICES
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Defender Services, in collaboration with the
    Committee on Court Administration and Case Management, endorsed changes
    to the Judicial Conference policy on electronic access to official transcripts
    (see supra, “Electronic Transcripts Policy,” pp. 12-13). At the request of the
    Executive Committee, the Committee on Defender Services made
    recommendations as to which outstanding Judicial Conference-approved

                      legislative proposals relating to defender services should be pursued in the
                      next Congress. The Committee also received status reports on defender
                      services program cost-containment initiatives, including recent progress on
                      two of them: (a) establishing a source to provide objective case-budgeting
                      assistance to judges, and (b) requesting that the Department of Justice use an
                      expedited process for determining whether to eliminate the death penalty as
                      an option in certain cases.


             COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL-STATE JURISDICTION
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction reported that it received
                      an update from a representative of the Social Security Administration (SSA)
                      on the implementation of a new disability claims process in that agency’s
                      Boston Region, which began on August 1, 2006. The Committee also
                      continued its discussion of proposed legislation, not yet introduced in
                      Congress, that would affect the jurisdiction of the Court of International
                      Trade, shifting to that court some categories of cases currently heard in the
                      federal district courts. The Committee was also briefed on the capital habeas
                      corpus study being undertaken by the Administrative Office and the Federal
                      Judicial Center. The Committee discussed with a representative of the
                      Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules the federalism implications of
                      proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 502, which would govern the
                      consequences of disclosing privileged or protected matters.


             COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Financial Disclosure reported that it assisted the
                      Judicial Conference in pursuing legislation to restore the judiciary’s authority
                      to redact judicial officers’ financial disclosure reports for security reasons,
                      and to make the financial disclosure obligations of judicial officers more
                      consistent with the role of the judiciary and judges’ recusal obligations under
                      28 U.S.C. § 455. At the request of the Executive Committee (see supra,
                      “Miscellaneous Actions,” pp. 6-7), the Committee began a comprehensive
                      review of judicial branch ethics policies relating to judicial attendance at
                      expense-paid private seminars, and the correlation of the various reporting

    requirements triggered by judicial attendance at such events. The Committee
    also reported that as of December 31, 2006, it had received 4,260 financial
    disclosure reports and certifications for calendar year 2005, including 1,358
    reports and certifications from Supreme Court justices, Article III judges, and
    judicial officers of special courts; 378 reports from bankruptcy judges; 566
    reports from magistrate judges; and 1,958 reports from judicial employees.


 COMMITTEE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Information Technology reported that it reviewed
    the Judiciary Information Technology Fund Annual Report, which describes
    sources of funds, obligations, and unobligated balances. The Committee
    focused on the significant accumulation of unobligated balances, which in
    large measure reflects the cumulative results of cost-containment initiatives
    and the success of the CM/ECF system in the district and bankruptcy courts.
    It adopted a multi-part strategy to reduce future unobligated balances,
    including expanding the use of Electronic Public Access funds. The
    Committee also supported proposed changes to the advanced information
    technology training program for judges, including moving from a national to a
    local delivery model. The Committee also endorsed the creation of an “IT
    Associates” exchange program that would allow both court and
    Administrative Office managers to identify and utilize, on a temporary basis,
    the expertise and skills of information technology employees from the
    Administrative Office or courts, respectively, to accomplish specific tasks or
    projects.


COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that, during
    calendar year 2006, 132 intercircuit assignments were undertaken by 80
    Article III judges and one retired associate justice. The Committee continued
    to disseminate information about intercircuit assignments to increase
    awareness and facilitate the use of visiting judges, and it aided courts
    requesting assistance by identifying and obtaining judges willing to take
    assignments.

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on International Judicial Relations reported on its
                      involvement in rule of law and judicial reform activities throughout the world,
                      highlighting those in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Russian
                      Federation. The Committee further reported on its continued participation in
                      the rule of law component of the Library of Congress’s Open World Program
                      for Russian and Ukrainian jurists visiting the United States. In addition, the
                      Committee reported on foreign delegations of jurists and judicial personnel
                      receiving briefings at the Administrative Office, and on the Korean judge

                      JUDGES’ TRAVEL

                              In order to maintain compliance with income tax laws, the Committee
                      on the Judicial Branch recommended, and the Judicial Conference adopted, a
                      revision to section F.1 of the Travel Regulations for United States Justices and
                      Judges (Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, vol. 3, ch. C-5, ex. A) to
                      require judicial travelers to submit receipts or other documentary evidence to
                      substantiate their claims for reimbursement of certain official travel expenses.


                      FEDERAL EMPLOYEES’ GROUP LIFE INSURANCE

                              In March 2002, the Conference agreed to seek legislation to require
                      the federal government to pay all the costs associated with active and senior
                      Article III judges’ and congressional members’ Federal Employees’ Group
                      Life Insurance (FEGLI) premiums (JCUS-MAR 02, p. 20). Citing significant
                      executive branch opposition to and little congressional support for an
                      employer-pay-all FEGLI benefit for a narrow category of federal employees,
                      the Committee recommended that the Conference rescind its March 2002
                      position, and the Conference agreed.

    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that it has devoted its
    priority attention to securing an immediate and substantial increase in judicial
    salaries, consistent with the Chief Justice’s 2006 Year-End Report on the
    Federal Judiciary (see also supra, “Judicial Compensation,” p. 4). In other
    efforts to promote judicial independence, the Committee continues to take
    affirmative steps to enhance interbranch communications, as well as to
    maintain communications with the bar and the media. It also continues to
    give substantial attention to judicial benefits matters.


COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND DISABILITY1
    JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND DISABILITY ACT
    STUDY COMMITTEE REPORT

            In 2004, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist appointed a committee,
    chaired by Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer, to study the implementation
    of the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980. The Judicial Conduct and
    Disability Act Study Committee (the Breyer Committee) issued its report in
    September 2006, and the Executive Committee subsequently asked the
    Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability to review and make
    recommendations to the Conference on any actions that should be taken
    concerning the report (see supra, “Miscellaneous Actions,” pp. 6-7).

            Conference Authority to Review Committee Decisions. The Breyer
    Committee recommended that the Conference consider clarifying the scope of
    the Conference’s authority to review Judicial Conduct and Disability
    Committee decisions. Noting that its own authority is entirely derivative of
    the Conference’s authority and that, therefore, any Committee decision is
    reviewable by the Conference, the Judicial Conduct and Disability Committee
    recommended that the Conference direct it to prepare for Conference
    consideration a rule, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 331 and 358(a), that clarifies
    the authority of the Judicial Conference to review on its own initiative any
    Judicial Conduct and Disability Committee decision, including orders

     Prior to March 12, 2007, this Committee was known as the Committee to
    Review Circuit Council Conduct and Disability Orders (see supra, “Five-Year
    Self-Evaluation and Jurisdictional Review,” p. 5).

                      granting or denying petitions for review in misconduct proceedings. The rule
                      would also make clear that no complainant or judge who is the subject of a
                      complaint would have any right to invoke such review. The Conference
                      adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                               Other Breyer Committee Recommendations. In order to achieve the
                      goals set forth by the Breyer Committee and fulfill its own mission, the
                      Judicial Conduct and Disability Committee recommended that the Conference
                      authorize and direct the Committee to develop, and present to the Conference
                      for approval, comprehensive guidelines, and, as necessary, additional rules
                      pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 331 and 358(a), to implement the Judicial Conduct
                      and Disability Act in a consistent manner throughout the federal court system.
                      The Committee indicated that chief judges, circuit judicial councils, and
                      circuit staff should be provided specific binding guidance on an array of
                      difficult, substantive, procedural, and administrative issues identified in the
                      Breyer Committee report. In addition, clerks’ offices and circuit judicial
                      councils should be required to transmit specified material to the Committee so
                      that it has a sufficient basis for monitoring implementation. The Conference
                      adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                      JURISDICTION TO CONSIDER PETITIONS FOR REVIEW

                               In its April 28, 2006 opinion, In re Opinion of Judicial Conference
                      Committee to Review Circuit Council Conduct and Disability Orders, 449
                      F.3d 106 (U.S. Jud. Conf. 2006), the Judicial Conduct and Disability
                      Committee expressed the view that it does not have jurisdiction to review a
                      circuit judicial council’s affirmance of a chief judge’s dismissal of a conduct
                      and disability complaint where a special investigating committee under 28
                      U.S.C. § 353 had not been appointed. Believing, upon reconsideration, that
                      such authority does exist, the Committee recommended that the Judicial
                      Conference direct it to prepare for Conference consideration a rule, pursuant
                      to 28 U.S.C. §§ 331 and 358(a), that explicitly authorizes the Committee on
                      Judicial Conduct and Disability to examine whether a misconduct complaint
                      requires the appointment of a special committee, upon dismissal of the
                      complaint by the chief judge under 28 U.S.C. § 352(b), or upon the denial of a
                      petition for review of the complaint by the circuit judicial council under 28
                      U.S.C. § 352(c). The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability reported that it
    continues to carry out its responsibilities with regard to considering petitions
    for review of final actions by circuit judicial councils on complaints of
    misconduct or disability of federal judges.


COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES
    ARTICLE III JUDGESHIP NEEDS

            Additional Judgeships. The Committee on Judicial Resources
    considered requests and justifications for additional judgeships in the courts of
    appeals and the district courts as part of its 2007 biennial judgeship survey
    process. Based on its review, and after considering the views of the courts
    and the circuit councils, the Committee recommended that the Judicial
    Conference authorize transmittal to Congress of a request for the addition of
    13 permanent and 2 temporary judgeships in the courts of appeals, and for the
    addition of 38 permanent and 14 temporary judgeships, the conversion to
    permanent status of 5 existing temporary judgeships, and the extension of

                      are reviewed for the purpose of determining whether to recommend to the

The Conference adopted a Committee recommendation that Congress be
advised that the existing vacancy in the District of Wyoming and the next
judgeship vacancy occurring in the Eastern District of Louisiana should not be
filled, based on the consistently low weighted caseloads in these districts.


ACCESS TO JUDGES’ PERSONAL DATA

        The Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS) is
the judiciary’s automated personnel and payroll system, housing, among other
things, personal benefits and retirement data for judges and judiciary
employees. Currently court staff (primarily human resources managers and
specialists) have “view-only” access to standard personal data (e.g., benefits
and retirement information) for judiciary employees. They have not had
access of any kind to judges’ data because of security concerns. After
determining that HRMIS has passed comprehensive independent and self-
administered security testing, and in order to provide judges with the same
level of personnel service as that received by judiciary employees, the Judicial
Resources Committee recommended that the Conference authorize the
Administrative Office to provide certain court staff with view-only access to
judges’ personal data in the judiciary’s automated personnel and payroll
system, subject to the following conditions:

a.     the chief judge of each participating court, or his or her designee,
       makes a determination that access be provided with respect to data for
       all the judges in a particular court;

b.     each participating court designates which staff is to be provided
       access; and

c.     each participating court establishes procedures to ensure the security
       of the judges’ data.

The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


LAW CLERK QUALIFICATIONS

         Since 2003, the Judicial Conference has expanded the qualifications
standards for chambers law clerks, for purposes of establishing grade
eligibility, to include experience as a pro se law clerk (JCUS-SEP 03, p. 28), a
staff attorney (JCUS-MAR 04, p. 20), and a bankruptcy appellate panel law

                                      23
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      clerk (JCUS-SEP 06, p. 27). Because there is no reason to distinguish death
                      penalty law clerk experience for this purpose from that gained while
                      employed in these other positions, the Committee recommended, and the
                      Conference approved, an expansion of the qualifications standards for
                      chambers law clerks to credit death penalty law clerk experience in
                      establishing grade eligibility.


                      PRO SE LAW CLERKS

                              In March 2002, the Judicial Conference adopted a stabilization policy
                      for allocating pro se law clerk positions, which provides that the number of
                      such positions in a court will be reduced only if the number of prisoner filings
                      does not support the court’s allocated positions under the staffing formula for
                      two consecutive years (JCUS-MAR 02, p. 22). Due to a greater than usual
                      increase in prisoner petition filings for the 12-month period ending in June
                      2005 (likely a result of the Supreme Court’s decisions in Blakely v.
                      Washington and United States v. Booker/United States v. Fanfan), followed
                      by a return to “normal” levels for the period ending June 2006, many districts
                      are currently over strength and, under the existing stabilization policy, would
                      be required to reduce their on-board staffing levels by December 2007.
                      Noting that a new staffing formula for pro se law clerks is in development and
                      may require courts that downsize to rehire immediately, the Judicial
                      Resources Committee recommended, and the Conference approved, a
                      temporary modification to the stabilization factor for the pro se law clerk
                      allocation for courts with over-strength positions in fiscal year 2007. Starting
                      with fiscal year 2008, the number of allocated positions will only be reduced
                      if the number of prisoner filings does not support the allocated positions under
                      the pro se law clerk staffing formula for three consecutive years. The two-
                      year requirement will resume once a new pro se law clerk staffing formula is
                      in place. As with the two-year stabilization policy, if an over-strength
                      position is vacated, the court will not be allowed to refill that vacancy.


                      ELECTRONIC COURT RECORDER OPERATOR

                             Individual requests for additional staffing resources for the Court of
                      Federal Claims are made to the Conference, through the Judicial Resources
                      Committee, whenever the court determines a need. Noting that an increasing
                      number of the court’s judges are using electronic sound recording in lieu of
                      contract court reporters to take the official court record, the chief judge of the
                      Court of Federal Claims requested one additional full-time deputy clerk

                                                              24

position to be used for an electronic court recorder operator. On
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the request for a
period of three years, with the understanding that any extension of the
position or authorization of any other clerk’s office position in this court
would occur only in accordance with an authorized staffing formula based on
a work measurement study by the Administrative Office.


INFORMAL RECOGNITION AWARDS

        Non-monetary “informal recognition” awards are given to employees
for performance that may not merit a larger award but is recognized by
supervisors or peers as contributing significantly to the mission of the court by
improving internal or external customer service or increasing efficiency. The
cost of an informal recognition award has generally not been permitted to
exceed $50 per court employee, per year. Guide to Judiciary Policies and
Procedures, vol. 1, ch. 10, subch. 1451.2.F.4.c(1). In response to concerns
from the courts that this limit does not provide enough flexibility for courts to
acknowledge outstanding individual and team performance, service, and acts,
the Committee recommended, and the Conference agreed, that the non-
monetary informal recognition award cap should be raised from $50 to $100,
per court employee, per year.


COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

        The Committee on Judicial Resources reported that the portion of its
report to the September 2007 Judicial Conference dealing with the court
compensation study will be made available for court comment before it is
submitted to the Conference. In addition, the Committee endorsed a change
in the work measurement methodology employed to develop staffing formulas
to (a) use a combination of “core modeling” and other measurement
techniques to reflect better the courts’ full staffing requirements; and (b) use
court-reported data that are validated through simultaneous measurement by
the Administrative Office. The Committee voiced strong support for the
background checks and investigations program for courts and federal public
defender organizations.

Judicial Conference of the United States


             COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL SECURITY
                      FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE

                              The Committee on Judicial Security cited serious concerns about the
                      ability of the Federal Protective Service (FPS) to provide the judiciary with
                      adequate services, working equipment, detailed billing records, justification
                      for current costs, and projections for future costs that would allow for proper
                      budgeting. The Committee therefore recommended that the Conference
                      support the efforts of the United States Marshals Service, through
                      administrative and/or legislative remedies, to assume the security functions
                      currently performed by the FPS in courthouses, as appropriate, and the
                      associated funding. The Conference approved the Committee’s
                      recommendation.


                      HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12

                               Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), signed by
                      President Bush in August 2004, establishes a mandatory standard for a secure
                      and reliable form of identification, known as the Personal Identity
                      Verification (PIV) card, to be issued by the federal government to its
                      employees and contractors (including contractor employees). These cards
                      will be used initially only for visual identification purposes, but eventually
                      could be used with electronic card readers to provide access to government
                      facilities and computer networks. HSPD-12 applies only to executive branch
                      personnel but, as a practical matter, the judiciary is affected by the directive
                      because it is housed in facilities owned or leased by the General Services
                      Administration and is protected by the Marshals Service, and both of these
                      agencies must comply with HSPD-12. Without PIV cards, judges, clerks, and
                      other court personnel might not have after-hours access to their buildings and,
                      during regular business hours, may be required to enter the building on the
                      same terms as members of the general public, which could affect the
                      judiciary’s service to the public. On recommendation of the Committee, the
                      Conference endorsed judiciary participation in the HSPD-12 program.

    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

            The Committee on Judicial Security reported that it discussed
    continuing progress on updating the court security officer (CSO) formula,
    transferring responsibility for court security officer medical standards to the
    Marshals Service, and completing a memorandum of understanding with the
    Marshals Service regarding the settlement of court security officer lawsuits
    related to the CSO medical standards. In addition, the Committee was briefed
    on the status of the home intrusion detection systems program and other
    pending issues by the Director of the Marshals Service.

magistrate judge position vacancies (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 26), the Committee
chair approved filling existing or upcoming vacancies in six courts during the

                                      29
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      period between the Committee’s June 2006 and December 2006 meetings,
                      and at its December 2006 meeting the full Committee determined that one
                      magistrate judge position vacancy should be filled. The Committee discussed,
                      from a long-range planning perspective, the involvement of magistrate judges
                      in court governance and reaffirmed its existing long-range goal for voting
                      membership of magistrate judges at all levels of the court governance
                      structure. The Committee communicated with the Judicial Panel on
                      Multidistrict Litigation to urge the Panel to invite magistrate judges to its
                      yearly conference for active transferee district judges.


             COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
                      FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

                              The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                      Judicial Conference a technical amendment to subdivision (6)(a) of Rule C (In
                      Rem Actions: Special Provisions) of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or
                      Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions, together with a Committee
                      Note explaining its purpose and intent. The Judicial Conference approved the
                      proposed amendment and authorized its transmittal to the Supreme Court for
                      consideration with a recommendation that it be adopted by the Court and
                      transmitted to Congress in accordance with the law.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                             The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure approved for
                      publication proposed amendments to Civil Rules 13(f), 15(a), and 48. The
                      Committee also approved in principle the recommendation of the Advisory
                      Committee on Bankruptcy Rules to publish for public comment proposed
                      amendments to Bankruptcy Rules 7052 and 9021 and proposed new
                      Bankruptcy Rule 7058. The Advisory Committees on Bankruptcy, Criminal,
                      and Evidence Rules are reviewing comments from the public submitted on
                      amendments proposed in August 2006 to their respective sets of rules. The
                      proposals include amendments implementing the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,
                      18 U.S.C. § 3771, and amendments implementing the Bankruptcy Abuse
                      Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-08), which
                      are based substantially on the interim bankruptcy rules.

COMMITTEE ON SPACE AND FACILITIES
    FIVE-YEAR COURTHOUSE PROJECT PLAN

             In order to address a growing backlog of construction projects on the
    judiciary’s annual Five-Year Courthouse Project Plan, in September 2003, the
    Judicial Conference froze the plan as adopted in that year until not more than
    $500 million of courthouse projects remained on the first-year list (JCUS-SEP
    03, pp. 37-38). Since that time, courthouse project requests have been
    submitted to the Conference for approval one year at a time. At this session,
    in response to strong support expressed in Congress for resumption of Five-
    Year Courthouse Project Plans, the Committee proposed, and the Conference
    endorsed (subject to revisions related to project costs, funding phases, or
    congressional action), a Five-Year Courthouse Project Plan for FYs 2008-
    2012. No projects without congressional authorizations and/or appropriations
    are included in the plan. Moreover, it is anticipated that the projected rent for
    all the projects in the plan will fit within the rent budget cap of 4.9 percent
    annual growth approved by the Judicial Conference (JCUS-SEP 06, pp. 10).


    BUDGET CHECK PROCESS

            Since September 2004, the Judicial Conference has maintained an
    interim budget check process for all pending space requests to ensure that
    alternative space, future rent implications, and affordability by the judiciary
    are considered prior to project approval (see JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 35-36; JCUS-
    MAR 06, p. 27). Pursuant to that process, and on recommendation of the
    Committee, in consultation with the Budget Committee, the Conference
    approved 10 space requests. The annual rent that will be generated by these
    requests will be charged against, and is anticipated to fit within, the 4.9
    percent annual budget cap on space rental growth. (See also supra,
    “Miscellaneous Actions,” pp. 6-7).


    U.S. COURTS DESIGN GUIDE

            As noted above, in July 2006 the House Committee on Transportation
    and Infrastructure passed a resolution that requires courtroom sharing for
    senior judges (see supra, “Courtrooms for Senior Judges,” p. 11). This
    resolution also directs the Judicial Conference to approve specifically each
    departure (also referred to as an exception) from the U.S. Courts Design


                                           31
Judicial Conference of the United States

                      Guide relating to a courthouse construction project that would result in
                      additional costs. It also requires that justification for the departure, with a
                      cost estimate, be provided to GSA, which would then recommend whether the
                      relevant House and Senate committees should approve the departure. In order
                      to curtail costly departures from the Design Guide, and to comply with the
                      House Committee resolution, the Space and Facilities Committee
                      recommended that, for prospectus-level courthouse projects, Conference
                      approval be required, after review by the Space and Facilities Committee, for
                      any departure from the Design Guide approved by a circuit judicial council
                      that would result in additional estimated costs (including additional rent
                      payment obligations). In addition, so that Congress fully understands why
                      departures are being sought for individual projects, the Committee
                      recommended that if a departure is approved by the Conference, the chair of
                      the circuit’s space and facilities committee or the chief judge or project judge
                      requesting construction that exceeds Design Guide criteria must be willing, if
                      requested by the Committee on Space and Facilities, to appear before
                      Congress concerning funding for such construction. After discussion, the
                      Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.


                      NAMING COURTHOUSES

                             In order to establish consistency in naming conventions for federal
                      courthouses, the Committee recommended and the Conference approved the
                      following conventions:

                      a.       For a facility occupied solely by a federal court, the title “United
                               States Courthouse” should be used;

                      b.       For a multi-tenant facility that includes at least one courtroom, the title
                               “United States Courthouse and Federal Building” or “United States
                               Courthouse and Post Office” should be used; and

                      c.       When naming a building after a judge, the title “Honorable” or
                               “Judge” should not be used.




                                                               32
                                                                         March 13, 2007



    COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

             The Committee on Space and Facilities reported that with regard to
    criteria for the closure of non-resident facilities, it reconsidered and agreed to
    include additional data elements to calculate the effectiveness score for the
    facilities. In addition, the Committee agreed to change the relative weight
    given to the operating cost score as compared to the effectiveness score when
    calculating an overall closure score. The Committee also considered changes
    to its jurisdictional statement, reviewed Conference-approved legislative
    proposals dealing with space issues, updated and endorsed its long-range
    strategic plan, and was briefed on the rent budget cap and rent validation
    initiatives.


FUNDING
            All of the foregoing recommendations that require the expenditure of
    funds for implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to
    the availability of funds and to whatever priorities the Conference might
    establish for the use of available resources.
