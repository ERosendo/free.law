                                     Appointed as committee chairs by the Chief Justice of the
                                United States, these outstanding jurists have played a vital role
                                in the administration of the federal court system. These judges
                                served with distinction as leaders of their Judicial Conference
                                committees while, at the same time, continuing to perform their
                                duties as judges in their own courts. They have set a standard
                                of skilled leadership and earned our deep respect and sincere
                                gratitude for their innumerable contributions. We acknowledge
                                with appreciation their commitment and dedicated service to
                                the Judicial Conference and to the entire federal judiciary.


                       SENIOR DISTRICT JUDGE PARTICIPATION
                       IN COURT GOVERNANCE

                               The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 (Pub. L. No. 110-177),
                       enacted in January 2008, contained two provisions that expand the role in
                       court governance of district court judges who take senior status under
                       28 U.S.C. § 371(b). However, the provisions differ on whether these judges
                       must meet a workload requirement in order to exercise a statutory right to
                       participate in the selection of magistrate judges. Noting the confusion in the

                                                                5

                      courts caused by the contradictory provisions, and the need for expeditious
                      resolution of the discrepancy before the 110th Congress adjourns, the
                      Committee on Court Administration and Case Management asked the
                      Executive Committee to approve on behalf of the Conference a
                      recommendation that the Conference seek repeal of section 504, which does
                      not contain a workload requirement. The Executive Committee approved the
                      recommendation. (See also infra, “Senior Judge Participation in Court
                      Governance,” pp. 11-12; 29-30.)

                        an extensive briefing on the AO’s audit and investigations responsibilities.
                        The Committee emphasized that conducting thorough and comprehensive
                        financial audits and ensuring that corrective actions are taken to address any

                              The Bankruptcy Committee reported that it considered a
                      recommendation of its Subcommittee on Judgeships regarding the continued
                      need for existing bankruptcy judgeships. It also endorsed the proposed new
                      staffing formula for bankruptcy clerks’ offices approved by the Judicial
                      Conference at this session (see infra, “Staffing Formulas,” p. 24), and voted to
                      recommend to the Budget Committee that funding in FY 2010 remain at the
                      FY 2009 adjusted current services levels for the three areas within the
                      Bankruptcy Committee’s jurisdiction. In addition, the Committee received

                      FISCAL YEAR 2010 BUDGET REQUEST

                              After careful consideration of the funding levels proposed by the
                      program committees, the Committee on the Budget recommended to the
                      Judicial Conference a fiscal year 2010 budget request to Congress that is 7.4
                      percent above assumed appropriations for fiscal year 2009. This request is
                      consistent with the budget caps approved by the Judicial Conference for the
                      various accounts within the judiciary’s budget. The Conference approved the
                      budget request subject to amendments necessary as a result of (a) new
                      legislation, (b) actions of the Judicial Conference, or (c) any other reason the
                      Executive Committee considers necessary and appropriate.


                      CAPITAL INVESTMENT FUND

                              In order to provide courts with greater flexibility in the management of
                      their resources, the Budget Committee proposed that the Judicial Conference
                      establish a fund that would allow courts to carry forward moneys saved from a
                      previous fiscal year to use in future years to fund major and multi-year
                      projects. In accordance with the Committee’s recommendation, the

                       Conference agreed to establish a Capital Investment Fund pilot program for a
                       four-year period beginning in fiscal year 2009, subject to congressional
                       approval, which would allow participating court units to do the following:

                       a.       Voluntarily return funds for deposit into the Capital Investment Fund
                                up to a maximum at any given time of $50,000;

                       b.       Utilize funds deposited into the Capital Investment Fund in subsequent
                                fiscal years, once the Executive Committee has approved the national
                                Salaries and Expenses financial plan and final allotments have been
                                transmitted to the courts; and

                       c.       Expend funds deposited into the Capital Investment Fund specifically
                                for, and limited to, tenant alterations, cyclical facilities maintenance,
                                non-judicial furniture, capital goods, courtroom technology, and multi-
                                year contracts for services that enhance major projects and

                       Cost Control Monitoring System, the funding formula used to issue salary
                       allotments to the courts. These changes included updating salary baselines,
                       modifying national average salaries for bankruptcy court and court interpreter
                       positions, and adding a locality adjustment factor to national average salaries
                       for courts in high-cost areas. The Committee also discussed the work
                       measurement process used to develop court staffing formulas and endorsed
                       updates to the information technology infrastructure and law enforcement
                       funding formulas.

                              In response to a request from Congress, the Court Administration and
                      Case Management Committee asked the Federal Judicial Center to conduct an
                      independent and comprehensive study of courtroom use in the district courts.
                      Based on the findings of this study, the Committee, after consultation with
                      several other Conference committees, recommended that the Conference adopt
                      several policy changes with regard to courtroom usage to be applied to new
                      courthouse construction and to construction of additional courtrooms in
                      existing buildings. After discussion and in accordance with the Committee’s
                      recommendations, the Conference agreed to —

                               regarding the assignment of courtrooms for senior judges to reflect a
                               policy that provides one courtroom for every two senior judges,
                               recognizing that the application of this policy for some senior judges
                               who maintain a high caseload may require closer examination and the
                               development of a standard, objective, and narrowly tailored exemption
                               policy.

                               – in consultation with the Committee on Space and Facilities and the
                               Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System – to
                               develop appropriate regulations for the U.S. Courts Design Guide to
                               implement a courtroom sharing policy for magistrate judges, balancing
                               the need to maintain the flexibility afforded to district courts to utilize
                               magistrate judge resources to meet local needs with the ability to
                               standardize space planning on a national basis, and ensuring the
                               efficient use of courtrooms without sacrificing the availability of
                               immediate access to a courtroom.

                       c.       Direct the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                                – in consultation with the Committee on Space and Facilities – to
                                assess the feasibility of, and to develop an appropriate policy
                                implementing, courtroom sharing among non-senior district judges in
                                large courthouses (i.e., courthouses with more than ten non-senior
                                district judges).

                       d.       Direct the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                                to study the usage of bankruptcy courtrooms and, if usage levels so
                                indicate, develop – in consultation with the Committee on Space and
                                Facilities and the Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy
                                System – an appropriate sharing policy for bankruptcy courtrooms.

                       e.       Adopt the proposed “Report on the Usage of Federal District Court
                                Courtrooms” as the position of the Conference and transmit it, in
                                conjunction with the Federal Judicial Center’s study on courtroom use,
                                to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure’s
                                Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and
                                Emergency Management, as an explanation of the Conference’s views
                                on the FJC’s study.


                       SENIOR DISTRICT JUDGE PARTICIPATION
                       IN COURT GOVERNANCE

                               As previously noted (see supra, “Senior District Judge Participation in
                       Court Governance,” pp. 5-6), the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007
                       contains contradictory provisions relating to the statutory right of district
                       judges who take senior status under 28 U.S.C. § 371(b) to participate in the
                       selection of magistrate judges. Under section 503 of that Act, these judges
                       may elect to participate in magistrate judge selection if in the preceding
                       calendar year they performed an amount of work equal to or greater than the
                       amount of work an average judge in active service on that court would
                       perform in six months. Section 504 authorizes senior district judges to
                       participate in the appointment of magistrate judges without reference to a
                       workload requirement. As also noted supra, the Executive Committee
                       authorized seeking legislation to repeal section 504, which does not include a
                       workload requirement. To assist the courts in implementing the Act despite
                       the conflicting provisions, the Conference agreed to issue the following




                                                              11

                      guidance recommended by the Court Administration and Case Management
                      Committee:

                      a.       That the 50 percent workload requirement for senior judges set forth in
                               section 503 should apply to governance activities (including
                               appointing magistrate judges) while legislative repeal of section 504 is
                               being sought; and

                      b.       That the 50 percent workload requirement should be based on the
                               amount of work actually performed by a senior judge within the
                               district, but that courts, at their discretion, may include work
                               performed by the senior judge outside the district to assist courts in
                               need.

                      MISCELLANEOUS FEES

                              In March 2008, the Judicial Conference amended the Bankruptcy
                      Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule to clarify and make stylistic changes to fee
                      items to comport with current editorial standards. No fee amounts were
                      changed. At this session, on recommendation of the Committee, the
                      Conference approved similar technical and style revisions to the Court of
                      Appeals Miscellaneous Fee Schedule and the District Court Miscellaneous
                      Fee Schedule, which now read as follows:

                       DISTRICT OF NORTH DAKOTA

                               Section 114 of title 28, United States Code, establishes the District of
                       North Dakota as one judicial district comprised of four divisions, enumerates
                       the counties within each division, and sets out the places of holding court for
                       these divisions. In order for the district to have greater flexibility in adjusting
                       the workload among the judges of the court, the Committee, at the request of
                       the district court, recommended that the Conference seek legislation to amend
                       28 U.S.C. § 114 to eliminate references to the divisions and counties in the
                       District of North Dakota, while maintaining language providing that North
                       Dakota constitutes one judicial district and that court be held at Bismarck,
                       Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot. The Conference approved the Committee’s
                       recommendation.


                       DATA TRANSFER TO BANKRUPTCY CASE TRUSTEES

                               In March 1989, the Judicial Conference authorized the bulk electronic
                       transfer of data from bankruptcy courts to the Department of Justice’s
                       Executive Office for U.S. Trustees (EOUST), with the understanding that the
                       EOUST could not sell or otherwise distribute the data to other entities (JCUS-
                       MAR 89, p. 20). With the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
                       Consumer Protection Act of 2005, bankruptcy case trustees must collect and
                       report additional data from bankruptcy case files. To facilitate the work of the
                       case trustees and at the request of the EOUST, the Conference adopted a
                       Committee recommendation to permit the EOUST and bankruptcy
                       administrators to transfer to trustees in bankruptcy cases (or their agents) data
                       received from the judiciary’s Case Management/Electronic Case Files
                       (CM/ECF) system without application of the Electronic Public Access fee.
                       Such a transfer is limited to the data that the case trustees are required to
                       provide in final reports filed in bankruptcy cases, and the EOUST, the case
                       trustees and their agents, and the bankruptcy administrators are not permitted
                       to otherwise transfer or sell such data.


                       RECORDS DISPOSITION SCHEDULE FOR
                       ELECTRONIC CASE FILES

                             Pursuant to regulations adopted by the National Archives and Records
                       Administration (NARA) in December 2007, if an electronic record replaces


                                                               17

                      either a permanent hard copy record or a hard copy record that has both
                      temporary and permanent elements, a previously approved hard copy
                      permanent disposition authority may be applied to the entire electronic record
                      (36 C.F.R. § 1228.31(b)(1)(i) and (ii)). Since all appellate case files are
                      classified as permanent under existing records schedules, and virtually all
                      district and bankruptcy cases contain at least one permanent element under
                      such schedules (i.e., the docket sheet), the Committee recommended that the
                      Conference notify NARA that the judiciary will apply the previously approved
                      hard copy permanent disposition authority to appellate, district, and
                      bankruptcy court electronic case file records in accordance with 36 C.F.R.
                      § 1228.31(b)(1). The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                              The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                      reported that it considered, among other things, implementation of the Judicial
                      Conference’s access plan for electronic transcripts of court proceedings; the
                      measures used to rank courts with respect to case processing and how more
                      assistance could be provided to the “most congested courts”; and the future of
                      electronic case management systems in bankruptcy and district courts. The
                      Committee also considered and endorsed several budget items, including a
                      fiscal year 2010 records management program funding request and a fiscal
                      year 2010 libraries and computer-assisted legal research funding request, both
                      of which have been provided to the Budget Committee.

                      revisions to several national forms (AO forms 199A, 199B, 199C, 245B, and
                      472) to conform to statutory amendments, new privacy requirements, and
                      policy changes previously approved by the Conference. As part of its
                      continuing exploration of evidence-based practices, the Committee also
                      discussed the use of programs modeled on problem-solving courts (e.g., drug
                      courts and diversion courts) in the federal system, paying particular attention
                      to post-conviction reentry court programs. The Committee has asked the

                       CASE-BUDGETING PILOT PROJECT

                               In September 2005, the Judicial Conference approved a three-year pilot
                       project for the Defender Services appropriation to fund a position in up to
                       three circuits to support the case-budgeting process (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 21).
                       Preliminary reports indicate that the case-budgeting attorneys are helping to
                       contain costs and to improve the management of high-cost Criminal Justice
                       Act (CJA) representations. However, in order to ensure that the project is
                       evaluated effectively, the Committee on Defender Services recommended that
                       the Judicial Conference extend the time period of the pilot project by one year.
                       The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Defender Services reported that under its delegated
                       authority from the Judicial Conference (JCUS-MAR 89, pp. 16-17), it
                       approved federal defender organization FY 2009 budgets and grants totaling
                       $518 million. The Committee also reported that it reviewed data from the first
                       phase of an ongoing project to update a 1998 report on the cost, availability,
                       and quality of defense representation in federal death penalty cases. In
                       addition, the Committee received a status report on the follow-up actions from
                       a 15-district audit of the system for processing CJA payments to panel
                       attorneys and interpreters.

                       discussed a draft report prepared by the Government Accountability Office
                       related to the establishment of a federal judicial presence in American Samoa.
                       The Committee also discussed ways to more fully implement its charge to

                      identified possible areas of federal-state cooperation that would require
                      coordination with other Judicial Conference committees, such as working with
                      the state courts to improve the ability of federal and state courts at the local
                      levels to share files electronically. It continued its discussion of capital habeas
                      corpus petitions, focusing on ways the federal and state courts can improve
                      coordination between the two court systems related to capital litigation. The
                      Committee also continued its review of legislation that would amend the

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Information Technology reported that it reviewed a
                       status report on the information technology (IT) projects and initiatives funded
                       through the Judiciary Information Technology Fund and asked that the
                       information be made available to the court community on the J-Net. The
                       Committee also reviewed and endorsed revisions to the IT infrastructure
                       formula used to provide IT funds to the courts and agreed that an IT-related
                       component of the existing law enforcement formula should be established
                       beginning in fiscal year 2009. The Committee asked the Administrative
                       Office to work with two courts that have developed calendaring systems to
                       provide national support for those systems. The Committee received
                       information about, and approved implementation of, port-to-port encryption of
                       e-mail on the judiciary’s data communications network.


             C OMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT A SSIGNMENTS

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that 79
                       intercircuit assignments were undertaken by 61 Article III judges from
                       January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2008. The Committee recommended to the Chief
                       Justice changes to the Guidelines for Intercircuit Assignments (including
                       changes to the operating procedures) and agreed to distribute a revised
                       questionnaire to all Article III judges in order to update the Committee’s roster
                       of judges willing to take intercircuit assignments. To increase awareness and
                       facilitate the use of visiting judges, the Committee continued to disseminate
                       information about intercircuit assignments and aided courts requesting
                       assistance by identifying and obtaining judges willing to take assignments.


              C OMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL J UDICIAL R ELATIONS

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on International Judicial Relations reported on its
                       involvement in rule of law and judicial reform activities throughout the world.
                       The U.S. State Department, the United States Agency for International

Judicial Conference of the United States                                             September 16, 2008

                      Development and Training Office reported about the progress of rule of law
                      efforts. A special presentation by the World Bank’s Lead Public Sector
                      Specialist for the Europe and Central Asia Region focused on the Bank’s
                      support for justice sector reform in 17 countries in Europe and Central Asia,
                      including the Russian Federation, Croatia, and Bulgaria.


             C OMMITTEE ON THE J UDICIAL B RANCH

                      JUDICIAL SURVIVORS’ ANNUITIES SYSTEM

                              In March 2008, after considering a study conducted by the
                      Administrative Office on the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities System (JSAS)
                      coverage and cost, the Conference determined to seek legislation authorizing a
                      one-time open season for judges who previously opted not to enroll in JSAS,
                      with certain conditions. The JSAS study had also examined a September 1990
                      position of the Judicial Conference (JCUS-SEP 90, p. 85; see also JCUS-
                      MAR 91, p. 19) to seek legislation allowing survivors of judicial officers to
                      continue Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program enrollment
                      regardless of whether the judicial officer participated in JSAS. At this session
                      the Committee recommended that, in light of the Conference’s endorsement of
                      an open season to enroll in JSAS, the Conference should rescind its September
                      1990/March 1991 position supporting legislation to allow a federal judge’s
                      survivors to continue FEHB program enrollment whether or not the judge
                      participated in JSAS. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendation.


                      JUDGES’ TRAVEL REGULATIONS

                              Meetings with Governmental Agencies and Associations. On
                      recommendation of the Committee on the Judicial Branch, the Judicial
                      Conference amended section B.3. of the Travel Regulations for Justices and
                      Judges to clarify and simplify the procedure for approving judges’ attendance
                      at governmental meetings that are held within the geographic boundaries of a
                      court. Also on the Committee’s recommendation, the Conference clarified
                      that portion of section B.3. pertaining to meetings of non-governmental
                      organizations to substitute the phrase “colleges and universities, schools” for
                      the terms “educational institutes” and “educational institutions” to clarify
                      which organizations were intended to be covered in that section.

                               Security-Related Travel. On recommendation of the Committee, the
                       Judicial Conference approved an amendment to section B.3. of the judges’
                       travel regulations to specifically authorize reimbursement for judges and their
                       dependents for the expenses of security-related travel.

                               Travel Interruptions. The Committee recommended and the
                       Conference approved an amendment to section A.3. of the judges’ travel
                       regulations to expressly authorize reimbursement of judges for expenses of
                       transportation, lodging, meals, and incidentals that may result from the judges’
                       inability to complete their official travel due to illness or injury.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that it continues to
                       give high priority to securing the enactment of judicial salary restoration
                       legislation and a 2009 Employment Cost Index pay adjustment for judges. The
                       Committee also devoted considerable attention to benefits matters. In
                       addition, the Committee continues to work closely with the Freedom Forum’s
                       First Amendment Center on planning and conducting regional programs for
                       judges and journalists.

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability reported that it
                       adopted a uniform docket numbering scheme for judicial conduct and
                       disability complaints, as required under Rule 8(a) of the Rules for
                       Judicial-Conduct and Judicial-Disability Proceedings. Related efforts now
                       proceeding under the Committee’s direction include (a) developing a process
                       to monitor activity under the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act and the
                       Rules for Judicial-Conduct and Judicial-Disability Proceedings; (b) assessing
                       the Rules, after initial experience, for whether they may need to be adjusted;
                       (c) preparing online resource materials, including a compendium of
                       authorities; (d) responding to courts’ inquiries; and (e) developing a new
                       online system for the gathering and reporting of statistical data on complaints
                       under the Act and Rules.

             C OMMITTEE ON J UDICIAL R ESOURCES

                      STAFFING FORMULAS

                               Based on rigorous work measurement studies conducted by the
                      Administrative Office, the Committee on Judicial Resources recommended,
                      and the Judicial Conference approved, new staffing formulas for the offices of
                      bankruptcy clerks, circuit librarians, conference attorneys, and circuit
                      executives, for implementation in fiscal year 2009. The new formula for
                      bankruptcy clerks’ offices represents the first systematic adjustment to the
                      method for estimating bankruptcy staffing needs since the Bankruptcy Abuse
                      Prevention and Consumer Protection Act’s impact on workload became
                      apparent. The new formulas for the appellate court and circuit offices are the
                      first adjustments to these offices’ staffing formulas since fiscal year 2001.


                      TWO-PERCENT PRODUCTIVITY ADJUSTMENT

                              Included among the cost-containment strategies approved by the
                      Judicial Conference in September 2004 (see JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 5-7) was a
                      two-percent productivity adjustment to be applied cumulatively (through fiscal
                      year 2009) to certain outdated staffing formulas. However, citing to a
                      confluence of factors, including increased work requirements in appellate
                      court and district clerks’ offices, combined with possible decreased court
                      allotments resulting from implementation of new salary funding formulas, the
                      Committee concluded that imposition of a two-percent productivity
                      adjustment in fiscal year 2009 might create salary shortfalls that would be
                      difficult for some offices to sustain. The Committee therefore recommended
                      that the Conference eliminate the additional two-percent productivity
                      adjustment in fiscal year 2009 for the offices of the appellate clerks, staff
                      attorneys, bankruptcy appellate panel clerks, and district clerks. The
                      Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                      PRO SE LAW CLERKS

                              In March 2002, the Judicial Conference adopted a stabilization policy
                      for allocating pro se law clerk positions whereby the number of allocated
                      positions in a court would only be reduced if the number of prisoner filings
                      did not support those positions under the staffing formula for two years in a
                      row (JCUS-MAR 02, p. 22). In March 2007, the Conference temporarily
                      extended the stabilization period to three years, beginning in fiscal year 2008,

                                                             24
Judicial Conference of the United States                                              September 16, 2008

                       with the two-year period to resume once a new pro se law clerk staffing
                       formula was in place (JCUS-MAR 07, p. 24). Noting that a new staffing
                       formula will not be available until fiscal year 2010 and that some districts with
                       over-strength positions might have to downsize only to rehire after the new
                       formula is developed, the Committee recommended that the Conference
                       approve the retention of encumbered over-strength pro se law clerk positions
                       through fiscal year 2009, with the understanding that, in accordance with the
                       pro se law clerk stabilization policy, if an over-strength position is vacated, a
                       court would not be authorized to refill that vacancy. The Conference
                       approved the Committee’s recommendation.


                       COURT PERSONNEL SYSTEM

                                Benchmarks. As part of the judiciary’s long-term cost-containment
                       strategy approved by the Judicial Conference in September 2004, the Judicial
                       Resources Committee conducted a court compensation study to explore fair
                       and reasonable opportunities to limit future compensation costs. Based on
                       that study, in September 2007, the Conference approved a Committee
                       recommendation to replace existing Court Personnel System (CPS)
                       benchmarks with new benchmarks that more accurately reflect current job
                       duties and responsibilities performed in the courts (JCUS-SEP 07, pp. 24-25).
                       To implement this recommendation, at this session, the Committee
                       recommended, and the Conference approved, effective January 5, 2009, titles
                       and classification levels for forty new benchmarks, updated minimum
                       qualification requirements, and a revised procedure for classifying CPS
                       supervisory and managerial positions. Further, with regard to on-board
                       employees, the Conference agreed that CPS employees will remain in their
                       current classifications unless the court takes a personnel action that changes an
                       individual employee’s position, or the court decides to apply the new
                       benchmarks to the entire court unit or a portion of the court unit where all
                       employees are performing a particular function, e.g., all financial positions. In
                       the latter case, the decision to apply the new benchmarks to current employees
                       must be made in a consistent, nondiscriminatory manner based on sound
                       business principles.

                               CPS Salary Progression Policy. In September 2007, the Judicial
                       Conference agreed to modify the CPS salary progression policy to reduce the
                       number of automatic default step increases and to give unit executives greater
                       discretion to grant step increases based upon each employee’s overall
                       contribution. It also directed that national performance guidelines be
                       developed to assist executives in making decisions about pay increases


                                                              25
Judicial Conference of the United States                                             September 16, 2008

                      (JCUS-SEP 07, p. 25). At this session, the Committee recommended that the
                      Conference approve performance management guidelines for local
                      implementation along the lines set forth by the Committee. However, noting
                      that the October 2009 date envisioned for full implementation of the new
                      policy was unrealistic, it also recommended modification of the
                      implementation time line to delay pay linkage until October 2010, while
                      maintaining October 2009 as the date for implementation of the other aspects
                      of the policy. In addition, the Committee determined that three existing salary
                      progression policies had been superseded or were inconsistent with the new
                      salary progression policy. Consequently, it recommended that the pay-for-
                      performance policy adopted by the Judicial Conference for CPS employees in
                      1996 be eliminated, and that the quality-step-increase program (which has
                      been suspended since 1993) and the longevity bonus program (which has been
                      suspended since 2005) be eliminated for CPS and Judiciary Salary Plan (JSP)
                      employees. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.


                      STAFF COURT INTERPRETER POSITIONS

                              Conversion from CPS to JSP. Noting that staff court interpreter
                      positions are highly specialized and present unique challenges for fitting into
                      the new CPS salary progression policy due to the difficulties in making
                      meaningful distinctions on the fundamental elements of the interpreters’ work,
                      the Committee recommended that the Conference approve the conversion of
                      the staff court interpreter position from the CPS to the JSP, effective October
                      13, 2008. It also recommended the creation of a JSP landmark standard with a
                      target grade of JSP-14 for all staff court interpreter positions and the
                      establishment of a grade JSP-15 for supervisory court interpreter positions.
                      The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.

                              Additional Positions. Using established criteria, the Committee
                      recommended, and the Conference approved, one additional Spanish staff
                      court interpreter position each for the Central District of California, the
                      District of New Mexico, the District of Oregon, and the Western District of
                      Texas, for fiscal year 2010, based on the Spanish language interpreting
                      workloads in these courts. Also on the Committee’s recommendation, the
                      Conference declined to authorize one Spanish staff court interpreter position
                      for the District of Connecticut. Accelerated funding in fiscal year 2009 was
                      authorized for the additional Spanish staff court interpreter positions approved
                      for the District of New Mexico and the Western District of Texas.

Judicial Conference of the United States                                              September 16, 2008



                       TYPE II DEPUTIES

                                Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Courts of appeals are permitted to
                       have only one Type II deputy position per unit at a JSP-16 level unless the
                       Judicial Conference finds that an additional Type II deputy is needed based on
                       unique circumstances and individual justification provided by the court.
                       Citing extraordinary circumstances in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the
                       Committee recommended that the Conference authorize a second JSP-16 Type
                       II chief deputy clerk position for the appellate clerk’s office in that circuit,
                       using existing decentralized funding. The Conference adopted the
                       Committee’s recommendation.

                               Courts of Appeals Generally. Since September 2004, district and
                       bankruptcy courts with 10 or more judgeships may obtain a second Type II
                       deputy position, funded with the court’s decentralized funds, upon notification
                       to the Administrative Office, and without Conference approval. Noting that
                       the complexity and scope of responsibilities assigned to appellate court unit
                       executives have changed substantially over the years, especially with the
                       advent of CM/ECF, and that a policy similar to that for district courts may be
                       appropriate for the courts of appeals, the Committee recommended that the
                       Conference adopt a policy authorizing any clerk’s office in an appellate court
                       with 12 or more authorized judgeships and a minimum staffing level of 75
                       full-time equivalents (validated by the appellate clerk’s office staffing formula
                       at 100 percent) to establish a second JSP-16 Type II chief deputy clerk
                       position, using its decentralized funds, upon notification to the Administrative
                       Office. The Conference approved the Committee’s recommendation


                       ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

                               In March 1998, the Judicial Conference approved “basic” and “robust”
                       staffing factors for clerk’s office positions performing duties related to
                       alternative dispute resolution (ADR) (JCUS-MAR 98, pp. 20-21). The basic
                       staffing factor was intended to apply to most district courts’ ADR programs,
                       while the robust factor was intended for a limited number of courts with
                       extensive ADR programs. Based on the number of cases participating in the
                       ADR program in the Northern District of Ohio, and on the number of hours
                       spent processing these cases, the Committee recommended that the
                       Conference approve that district’s request for application of the robust staffing
                       factor for clerk’s office positions with duties related to ADR. The Conference
                       adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                                                              27
Judicial Conference of the United States                                             September 16, 2008



                      ENTRY AND EXIT SURVEYS

                              In order to assist the judiciary in recruiting and retaining highly
                      qualified employees, the Committee recommended that the Conference
                      approve the concept and implementation of detailed national entry and exit
                      surveys for employees in the courts and federal public defender organizations,
                      and encourage their use. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendation.


                      HUMAN RESOURCES LEGISLATION

                              On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to
                      express to Congress the support of the judiciary for the concepts contained in
                      bills pending in the 110th Congress that would provide paid parental leave
                      (H.R. 5781), clarify the method for computing annuities under the Civil
                      Service Retirement System that are based on part-time service (H.R. 2780),
                      and amend title 5, United States Code, to facilitate the re-employment of
                      annuitants (H.R. 3579).


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Judicial Resources reported that it recommended to
                      the Committee on the Budget an FY 2010 budget request of 7.5 percent above
                      the FY 2009 baseline for that portion of the budget over which the Judicial
                      Resources Committee exercises responsibility. This request is within the
                      guidelines issued by the Budget Committee chair, but is about $20 million
                      short of the fiscal year 2010 total requirements level. To resolve the shortfall,
                      the Judicial Resources Committee recommended a proportionate reduction of
                      authorized work units based on each program area’s FY 2010 budget request.
                      In addition, the Committee, in consultation with the Criminal Law Committee,
                      endorsed a one-year moratorium on adopting new staffing formulas for
                      probation and pretrial services offices, to allow the Administrative Office the
                      opportunity to correlate work measurement results and case-weighting factors.
                      The Committee also postponed consideration of revisions to the court reporter
                      salary structure until December 2008 in order to obtain a broader view of the
                      court reporter salary situation.

              C OMMITTEE ON J UDICIAL S ECURITY

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Judicial Security reported that it began work with
                       the Defender Services and Criminal Law Committees to identify and resolve
                       issues arising from housing pretrial detainees in jail facilities located great
                       distances from the courthouse. Members and staff from the three committees
                       met in July 2008 with representatives from the U.S. Marshals Service, the
                       Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee, and
                       other criminal justice system staff to establish the scope of the problem. The
                       Committee was also briefed on the status of the perimeter security pilot
                       program at seven courthouses and considered the results of a survey of judges
                       on court and judicial security.

                       SENIOR DISTRICT JUDGE PARTICIPATION IN COURT
                       GOVERNANCE

                                As noted supra (see “Senior Judge Participation in Court
                       Governance,” pp. 5-6; 11-12), sections 503 and 504 of the Court Security
                       Improvement Act of 2007 are inconsistent on the issue of whether senior
                       district judges must meet a workload requirement in order to exercise a
                       statutory right to participate in the selection and appointment of United States
                       magistrate judges. Since, notwithstanding this inconsistency, at least some
                       senior district judges are now statutorily eligible to participate in the
                       appointment process, the Magistrate Judges Committee recommended, and the
                       Conference agreed, that the Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the
                       United States Establishing Standards and Procedures for the Appointment and
                       Reappointment of United States Magistrate Judges be amended to (a) remove
                       the word “active” from “active district judges” in sections 3.01, 3.02(a), 4.01,
                       6.02, and 6.03(c) (those provisions addressing who participates in the
                       appointment process) and (b) add the following language to the introduction:

                                References to district judges in sections 3.01, 3.02(a), 4.01,
                                6.02, and 6.03(c) of these regulations include all active district
                                judges and, as determined by the court, either all senior judges
                                or those senior judges who performed in the preceding calendar

                               seeking the repeal of Section 504 of the Court Security
                               Improvement Act of 2007, which amended 28 U.S.C. § 631(a)
                               to allow all senior judges to participate in the appointment of
                               magistrate judges.]


                      CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE JUDGE POSITIONS

                       ACCELERATED FUNDING

                               On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed
                       to designate for accelerated funding in fiscal year 2009 the new full-time
                       magistrate judge positions at Camden and Trenton in the District of New
                       Jersey; Harrisburg in the Middle District of Pennsylvania; Sherman in the
                       Eastern District of Texas; Memphis in the Western District of Tennessee; and

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System
                       reported that it asked the Executive Committee to authorize, on behalf of the
                       Judicial Conference and on an expedited basis, one new full-time and one new
                       part-time magistrate judge position for the District of Arizona and accelerated

                                                              33
Judicial Conference of the United States                                             September 16, 2008

                      funding for the new positions effective immediately. The Executive
                      Committee approved the recommendations (see supra, “Miscellaneous
                      Actions,” p. 6). Pursuant to the September 2004 Judicial Conference policy
                      regarding the review of magistrate judge position vacancies (JCUS-SEP 04,
                      p. 26), during the period between the Committee’s December 2007 and June
                      2008 meetings, the Committee chair approved filling eight full-time and four
                      part-time magistrate judge position vacancies. At its June 2008 meeting, the
                      Committee decided to defer until December 2008 decisions on two courts’
                      requests to fill vacancies in magistrate judge positions so that the Committee
                      could have the benefit of additional information provided by district-wide
                      reviews of the courts.


             C OMMITTEE ON R ULES OF P RACTICE AND P ROCEDURE

                      TIME COMPUTATION PROJECT

                              Rules Amendments. The Committee on Rules of Practice and
                      Procedure submitted to the Judicial Conference proposed amendments to 91
                      time-counting provisions in the Federal Rules of Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil,
                      and Criminal Procedure to simplify and reduce inconsistencies in the
                      computation of time periods under the procedural rules. The proposed new
                      rules adopt a “days-are-days” approach to computing time periods, i.e.,
                      intermediate weekends and holidays and not just work days are counted
                      regardless of the length of the specified period. To further simplify
                      time-counting, most periods of less than 30 days would be changed to 7, 14,
                      21, and 28-day periods wherever possible so that deadlines usually fall on
                      weekdays. To account for the effect of including intermediate weekends and
                      holidays in calculating time periods, the proposed amendments would also
                      extend short time deadlines. The Judicial Conference approved the
                      amendments and authorized their transmittal to the Supreme Court for its
                      consideration with a recommendation that they be adopted by the Court and
                      transmitted to Congress in accordance with the law.

                              Statutory Amendments. The time-computation methodology used in
                      the federal procedural rules applies to time periods set in statutes that affect
                      court proceedings, unless the statutes themselves specify how to compute
                      time. If the proposed rules amendments discussed above are adopted, they
                      would have the effect of shortening statutory time periods because
                      intermediate weekends and holidays would no longer be excluded. In order to
                      accommodate the changes that would result from the proposed amendments,
                      the Committee recommended that the Conference seek legislation to adjust the

Judicial Conference of the United States                                             September 16, 2008

                       time periods in 29 statutory provisions affecting court proceedings. The
                       Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                       FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE

                               The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                       Judicial Conference proposed amendments to Appellate Rules 4 (Appeal as of
                       Right — When Taken), 22 (Habeas Corpus and Section 2255 Proceedings),
                       and 26 (Computing and Extending Time), and proposed new Rule 12.1
                       (Remand After an Indicative Ruling by the District Court on a Motion for
                       Relief That is Barred by a Pending Appeal), together with Committee Notes
                       explaining their purpose and intent. The Judicial Conference approved the
                       amendments and new rule and authorized their transmittal to the Supreme
                       Court for its consideration with a recommendation that they be adopted by the
                       Court and transmitted to Congress in accordance with the law. See also supra,
                       “Time Computation Project,” p. 34.


                       FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE

                               The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                       Judicial Conference proposed amendments to Bankruptcy Rules 2016
                       (Compensation for Services Rendered and Reimbursement of Expenses), 4008
                       (Filing of Reaffirmation Agreement; Statement in Support of Reaffirmation
                       Agreement), 7052 (Findings by the Court), 9006 (Time), 9015 (Jury Trials),
                       9021 (Entry of Judgment), 9023 (New Trials; Amendment of Judgments), and
                       proposed new Rule 7058 (Entering Judgment in Adversary Proceeding),
                       together with Committee Notes explaining their purpose and intent. Many of
                       these changes are technical or conforming in nature. The Judicial Conference
                       approved the proposed amendments and new rules and authorized their
                       transmission to the Supreme Court for its consideration with a
                       recommendation that they be adopted by the Court and transmitted to
                       Congress in accordance with the law. See also supra, “Time Computation
                       Project,” p. 34.

                               The Committee also submitted to the Judicial Conference proposed
                       revisions to Bankruptcy Official Forms 8, 9F, 10, 23, and Exhibit D to Official
                       Form 1, and proposed new Official Form 27. The Judicial Conference
                       approved the revised forms to take effect on December 1, 2008, with the
                       exception of new Official Form 27, which will take effect on December 1,

                              The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                      Judicial Conference proposed amendments to Civil Rules 13 (Counterclaim
                      and Crossclaim), 15 (Amended and Supplemental Pleadings), 48 (Number of
                      Jurors; Verdict), and 81 (Applicability of the Rules in General; Removed

                      Relief That is Barred by a Pending Appeal), together with Committee Notes
                      explaining their purpose and intent. The Judicial Conference approved the
                      proposed amendments and new rule and authorized their transmittal to the
                      Supreme Court with a recommendation that they be adopted by the Court and

              C OMMITTEE ON S PACE AND F ACILITIES

                       CIRCUIT RENT BUDGET ALLOTMENTS -
                       COMPONENT B PROJECTS

                                Procedure. In September 2007, the Judicial Conference adopted a
                       circuit rent budget allotment methodology that divides the judiciary’s rent bill
                       into three components (JCUS-SEP 07, pp. 36-37). “Component B” of the rent
                       bill funds newly constructed courthouses or annexes, build-to-suit lease
                       projects, requests for General Services Administration (GSA) feasibility
                       studies, and prospectus-level repair and alteration projects (which require
                       Committee and Conference approval), as well as necessary chambers and
                       courtrooms for judges taking senior status, replacement judges, and new
                       judgeships (which require only the approval of the Committee). At this
                       session, on recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
                       approved the following process for approval of Component B project requests:
                       1) all decisions made by the Committee on Space and Facilities’ Rent
                       Management Subcommittee will be provided to circuit judicial councils for
                       comment prior to the full Committee’s consideration of the recommendations;
                       2) all comments received will be provided to the full Committee; and 3)
                       appeals of full Committee actions will be considered by the Judicial
                       Conference.

                               Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Conference adopted a
                       recommendation of the Committee to approve, as a Component B project, a
                       request from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for a new build-to-suit
                       leased courthouse in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, contingent on the district taking
                       nine specific space actions releasing space that would offset the anticipated
                       rent increase involved with adding the new courthouse.

                              The Committee on Space and Facilities reported that it endorsed the
                      Court Administration and Case Management Committee’s recommendations
                      to the Judicial Conference with regard to the courtroom usage study (see
                      supra, “Courtroom Usage Study,” pp. 10-11). The Committee also directed
                      AO staff to continue to work with GSA to reform the procurement process for
                      build-to-suit leased courthouses.


             F UNDING
                              All of the foregoing recommendations that require the expenditure of
                      funds for implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to
                      the availability of funds and to whatever priorities the Conference might
                      establish for the use of available resources.
