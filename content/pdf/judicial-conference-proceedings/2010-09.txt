                                            HONORABLE ROBERT L. HINKLE
                                           Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence

                                Appointed as committee chairs by the Chief Justice of the
                                United States, these outstanding jurists have played a vital role
                                in the administration of the federal court system. These judges
                                served with distinction as leaders of their Judicial Conference
                                committees while, at the same time, continuing to perform their
                                duties as judges in their own courts. They have set a standard
                                of skilled leadership and earned our deep respect and sincere
                                gratitude for their innumerable contributions. We acknowledge
                                with appreciation their commitment and dedicated service to
                                the Judicial Conference and to the entire federal judiciary.


                       JUDICIARY STRATEGIC PLANNING

                               In 2008, with the permission of the Chief Justice, the Executive
                       Committee formed an Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Judiciary Planning to
                       propose a new planning process for the federal judiciary. The group, which
                       was comprised of current and former Conference committee chairs and
                       members of the Executive Committee, as well as court executives, also took
                       on the role of developing a new strategic plan that would potentially replace
                       the Long Range Plan for the Federal Courts adopted by the Conference in
                       1995 (see JCUS-SEP 95, pp. 38-63). After two years of work and extensive
                       consultation within the judiciary, in August 2010, the Ad Hoc Advisory
                       Committee proposed a strategic plan that was intended to serve as a broad
                       action agenda addressing judiciary trends, issues, challenges, and
                       opportunities. Beginning with restatements of the vision, mission, and core
                       values of the judiciary, the plan identifies seven key issues and sets forth 13
                       strategies and more than 30 goals by which the judiciary could address those
                       issues. The Ad Hoc Advisory Committee also made several recommendations
                       with regard to an approach to planning.

                              On recommendation of the Executive Committee, and after discussion,
                       the Judicial Conference approved the proposed Strategic Plan for the Federal
                       Judiciary, as well as a recommended approach to planning, both with minor
                       changes recommended by the Executive Committee on the Conference floor.
                       With regard to the planning approach, the Conference agreed thatโ




                                                               5
Judicial Conference of the United States                                              September 14, 2010



                      a.       The Executive Committee chair may designate for a two-year
                               renewable term an active or senior judge, who will report to that
                               Committee, to serve as the judiciary planning coordinator. The
                               planning coordinator will have responsibility to facilitate and
                               coordinate the strategic planning efforts of the Judicial Conference and
                               its committees.

                      b.       With suggestions from Judicial Conference committees and others, and
                               the input of the judiciary planning coordinator, the Executive
                               Committee will identify issues, strategies, or goals to receive priority
                               attention over the next two years.

                      c.       The committees of the Judicial Conference will integrate the Strategic
                               Plan for the Federal Judiciary into committee planning and policy
                               development activities.

                      d.       For every goal in the Strategic Plan, a mechanism to measure or assess
                               the judiciary's progress will be developed.

                      e.       Any substantive changes to the Strategic Plan will require the approval
                               of the Judicial Conference, but the Executive Committee will have the
                               authority, as needed, to approve technical and non-controversial
                               changes to the Strategic Plan. A review of the Strategic Plan will take
                               place every five years.

                      f.       The new Strategic Plan for the Federal Judiciary will supersede the
                               December 1995 Long Range Plan for the Federal Courts as a planning
                               instrument to guide future policy-making and administrative actions
                               within the scope of Conference authority. This action, however,
                               should not be interpreted as an across-the-board rescission of the
                               individual Conference policies articulated in the recommendations and
                               implementation strategies of the earlier plan.

                               The Committee on Audits and Administrative Office Accountability
                       reported that it was briefed on the scope, methodology, findings, and
                       identified risks in recent audits. It also reviewed an analysis of audit data over
                       the past ten years, which showed a downward trend in the average number of
                       audit findings since the implementation of numerous enhancements to the
                       judiciary's financial management, audit, and internal control programs over the
                       last decade. Noting that the minority of court units which do not complete
                       annual internal control evaluations tend to have more audit findings, the
                       Committee asked the AO to consider how best to encourage those courts to

                      BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIP VACANCIES

                              In accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 152(b)(3), the Judicial Conference
                      conducts a comprehensive review of all judicial districts every other year to
                      assess the continuing need for authorized bankruptcy judgeships. By
                      December 31 of each even-numbered year, the Conference reports its
                      recommendations to Congress for the elimination of any authorized
                      bankruptcy judgeship position that can be eliminated when a vacancy exists by
                      reason of resignation, retirement, removal, or death. On recommendation of
                      the Bankruptcy Committee, which relied on the results of the 2010 continuing
                      needs survey, the Judicial Conference agreed to take the following actions:

                      a.       Recommend to Congress that no bankruptcy judgeship be statutorily
                               eliminated; and

                      b.       Advise the Eighth Circuit Judicial Council with regard to the District
                               of South Dakota and the Northern District of Iowa and the Ninth
                               Circuit Judicial Council with regard to the District of Alaska to
                               consider not filling vacancies in those districts that currently exist or
                               may occur by reason of resignation, retirement, removal, or death, until
                               there is a demonstrated need to do so.


                      CRITERIA FOR ADDITIONAL BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIPS

                              In March 1991, the Judicial Conference adopted a policy statement
                      regarding the standards to be used for considering requests for additional
                      bankruptcy judgeships. At the same time, the Conference adopted bankruptcy
                      case weights developed by the Federal Judicial Center to be used in
                      administering those standards (JCUS-MAR 91, pp. 12-13). The Federal
                      Judicial Center recently developed new case weights that reflect the effects of

                                                               8

                       economic, technological, and legislative developments since 1991 (such as the
                       enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act
                       of 2005) on the judicial time needed to process bankruptcy cases. The
                       Committee recommended that the Conference adopt the new case weights to
                       be used for assessing judgeship needs. The Committee also recommended
                       that the Conference revise the 1991 policy statement to (a) make non-
                       substantive changes to the standards for evaluating additional bankruptcy
                       judgeship needs; (b) add standards for evaluating requests for conversion of
                       temporary judgeships to permanent; and (c) incorporate the standards the
                       Conference has approved for use in the biennial continuing needs surveys.
                       The Conference approved the Committeeโs recommendations.


                       OFFICIAL DUTY STATIONS

                              On recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee and in accordance
                       with 28 U.S.C. ยง 152(b)(1), the Judicial Conference took the following actions
                       regarding official duty stations:

                       a.       Approved a request from the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council to
                                designate in the Central District of California Santa Ana as the duty
                                station for two of the vacant bankruptcy judgeships in that district and
                                Riverside as the duty station for the four bankruptcy judges currently
                                serving at that location; and

                       b.       Approved a request from the Second Circuit Judicial Council to
                                designate Burlington as the duty station for the bankruptcy judgeship
                                in the District of Vermont.

                       Conference approved revisions to the Regulations of the Judicial Conference
                       of the United States Governing the Bankruptcy Administrator Program that
                       clarify language and consolidate sections that were duplicative. The

                              The Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System
                      reported that it agreed unanimously to recommend to the Budget Committee
                      that funding in FY 2012 for recalled bankruptcy judges and temporary law
                      clerks remain at the FY 2011 projected current services levels. At the request
                      of the Budget Committee, the Bankruptcy Committee also discussed the
                      programmatic impact of a proposal to lower the budget cap for the Salaries
                      and Expenses account, and had no objection to the proposal.

                      FISCAL YEAR 2012 BUDGET REQUEST
                              .
                              After careful consideration of the funding levels proposed by the
                      program committees, the Committee on the Budget recommended to the
                      Judicial Conference a fiscal year 2012 budget request to Congress that is
                      4.7 percent above assumed appropriations for FY 2011. This request contains
                      funding to meet the essential, increasing workload needs of the judiciary while
                      taking into consideration the limited funding that Congress is likely to have
                      available. The Conference approved the budget request subject to
                      amendments necessary as a result of (a) new legislation, (b) actions of the
                      Judicial Conference, or (c) any other reason the Executive Committee
                      considers necessary and appropriate.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Budget reported that in light of the current and
                      projected austere fiscal outlook, its FY 2012 budget recommendation would
                      provide funding for only what is essential to support the judiciary's mission.
                      In addition, noting that it expects that budgets in the next several cycles will
                      be tighter than in the current cycle, the Budget Committee asked
                      Administrative Office staff to develop alternative budget cap proposals that
                      are lower than the current 8.2 percent annual budget cap for the Salaries and
                      Expenses account adopted by the Judicial Conference in March 2007
                      (JCUS-MAR 07, p. 10). Any proposals will be provided to the program
                      committees in advance of their December 2010 meetings for their input. The
                      Budget Committee commended the program committees for their

                       cost-containment initiatives to date and noted that the long-term financial
                       health of the judiciary will be aided by future cost-containment efforts that
                       provide tangible cost savings or avoidances.

                       Case Management, the Judicial Conference authorized a pilot project to
                       evaluate the effect of cameras in district court courtrooms, of video recordings
                       of proceedings therein, and of publication of such video recordings. The pilot
                       project will proceed in accordance with the tenets outlined below, and is
                       subject to definition and review by the Committee. In addition, the
                       Committee will request that a study of the pilot be conducted by the Federal
                       Judicial Center.

                       a.       The pilot will be national in scope and consist of up to 150 individual
                                judges from districts chosen to participate by the Federal Judicial
                                Center, in consultation with the Court Administration and Case
                                Management Committee. The pilot project should include a national
                                survey of all district judges, whether or not they participate in the pilot,

                      b.       The pilot will last up to three years, with interim reports prepared by

                      c.       The pilot will be limited to civil cases only.

                      d.       Courts participating in the pilot will record proceedings, and
                               recordings by other entities or persons will not be allowed.

                      e.       Parties in a trial must consent to participating in the pilot.

                      PACER ACCESS TO CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY FILINGS

                               Under the Judicial Conference policy on privacy and public access to
                      electronic case files, bankruptcy filings should include only the last four digits
                      of filersโ social security numbers on their petitions and other public documents
                      (JCUS-SEP/OCT 01, pp. 48-50). However, documents filed prior to
                      implementation of the policy in 2003 are still available on the Public Access
                      to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system and contain the debtorsโ full
                      social security numbers, creating privacy concerns. To address those
                      concerns, on recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
                      agreed to amend its privacy policy to restrict public access through PACER to

                                would have Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF)

                                courts, bankruptcy appellate panels, or courts of appeals for
                                bankruptcy cases filed before December 1, 2003, would be similarly
                                restricted.

                       The Conference also agreed to delegate to the Court Administration and Case
                       Management Committee the authority to develop implementation guidance for
                       the courts to effectuate this policy. This guidance will include encouraging
                       courts to establish a method to accept requests for copies of documents in
                       these cases.


                       CENTRAL VIOLATIONS BUREAU
                       PETTY OFFENSE CASES

                               Petty offense cases committed on federal property are processed by the
                       judiciaryโs Central Violations Bureau (CVB). In order to facilitate
                       management of such cases, the Administrative Office is working to integrate
                       CVB data into the CM/ECF system and make such cases accessible through
                       PACER. However, because standard CVB violation notices contain personal
                       identifiers such as social security numbers, full birth dates, and full home
                       addresses, the Committee recommended that the Conference endorse the
                       approach of providing courts with redacted and unredacted versions of the
                       CVB violation notice, with participant access to the unredacted version, and
                       public access through PACER to the redacted version. The Conference
                       adopted the Committeeโs recommendation.

Judicial Conference of the United States                                                    September 14, 2010




                      RECORDS MANAGEMENT

                               The Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference adopt a
                      revised district court records disposition schedule for civil cases that sets
                      retention periods for non-trial civil cases largely by case type. Under this
                      schedule, it is estimated that half of the closed case files currently in storage at
                      federal retention centers (for which storage fees are charged) would be
                      immediately eligible for disposal, which would lead to reductions in storage
                      fees. The Conference adopted the revised retention schedule.


                      PACER TRAINING PROGRAM

                              In September 2007, the Judicial Conference approved a pilot project to
                      provide free public access to PACER at Federal Depository Libraries (FDLs)
                      (JCUS-SEP 07, pp. 12-13). However, that program was suspended when a
                      PACER security vulnerability was discovered. At this session, the Committee
                      recommended, and the Conference approved, the establishment of a program
                      involving the Government Printing Office, the American Association of Law
                      Libraries, and the Administrative Office, that would provide training and
                      education to the public about the PACER service, and would exempt from
                      billing the first $50 of quarterly usage by a library participating in the
                      program.


                      COURT LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SERVICES

                              At the request of the Committee, the Administrative Office undertook
                      a comprehensive study of court libraries and library services focusing on the
                      role for libraries in the digital age, options for change, and consideration of
                      potential savings. Based on the results of that study, and after receiving
                      significant input from circuit librarians, subject matter experts, judges, and
                      legal researchers, among others, the Committee made a number of
                      recommendations, which were approved by the Conference as follows:

                      a.       With regard to library collections, agreed toโ

                               (1)         Ask that the Committee establish guidelines to discourage
                                           maintaining subscriptions to regional reporters, state case law
                                           reporters, and specialty reporters in libraries and advise circuit

                                                                   14
Judicial Conference of the United States                                                    September 14, 2010


                                           librarians to consider significantly reducing the number of
                                           subscriptions to the federal reporters in staffed libraries,
                                           especially Westโs Federal Supplement. If there is a concern
                                           that legal research services for the public/litigants or bar would
                                           be hindered if case law reporters are not available in the library,
                                           the local court(s) should consider using attorney admission
                                           funds to maintain the subscriptions.

                                (2)        Request that the circuit librarians conduct and lead a
                                           comprehensive assessment of usage and need in the
                                           headquarters library and each satellite library or shared
                                           collection. The assessment should involve local judges, legal
                                           researchers, and any relevant circuit library committees;
                                           consider if infrequently used categories of materials identified
                                           by the library survey results could be eliminated; and include
                                           an analysis of duplication. A summary of the assessment
                                           should be reported to the Committee.

                                (3)        Ask that the Committee establish guidelines discouraging
                                           subscriptions to case law reporters for newly appointed judges
                                           and existing judges.

                       b.       With regard to the number and size of libraries, agreed to request that
                                the circuit judicial councils, working with circuit librarians, library
                                committees, and relevant judges, review satellite libraries to assess the
                                continuing need for each library. In addition, they should review more
                                closely libraries that serve fewer than 10 judges and report to this
                                Committee whether those libraries will remain open or are targeted
                                either for closure or reduction in size and collection. Consideration
                                should be given to the circuit library program as a whole and the
                                impact of closure of any satellite on the remaining libraries and the
                                judges and others served.


                       NATIONAL VACCINE ACT PROPOSAL

                               The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 establishes a
                       procedure to compensate vaccine-injured individuals through use of vaccine
                       special masters within the United States Court of Federal Claims. Special
                       masters conduct hearings and issue findings of fact and conclusions of law,
                       and their determinations are appealable to Court of Federal Claims judges and


                                                                   15

                      then to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. To address significant
                      backlogs in processing these cases, the Court of Federal Claims has proposed
                      legislation that would (a) assign vaccine claims directly to Court of Federal
                      Claims judges, who could then hear the cases or refer them to vaccine judges;
                      (b) rename vaccine special masters as vaccine judges; (c) authorize vaccine
                      judges to issue a recommended decision, or with the consent of the parties,
                      hear and enter judgement; (d) with the consent of the parties, authorize appeal
                      of the vaccine judgeโs decision directly to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
                      Circuit; and (e) authorize the Court of Federal Claims clerk instead of the
                      chief special master to assume responsibility for the managerial aspects of the
                      vaccine judges. After considering the proposal, the Committee recommended
                      that the Judicial Conference decline to endorse renaming vaccine special
                      masters as vaccine judges in light of the limited jurisdiction of those officers,
                      but endorse the remaining concepts proposed by the Court of Federal Claims.
                      The Conference adopted the Committeeโs recommendations.


                      TRANSLATED FORMS

                               The Judicial Conference declined to approve a motion to recommit an
                      information item regarding the translation of court forms for voluntary use by
                      district courts in civil cases.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                      reported that given the current economic climate, it determined to defer until
                      June 2011 its cyclical review of miscellaneous fee schedules regarding
                      increases for inflation. The Committee continued to provide policy guidance
                      and oversight in the development of the functional requirements for the next
                      generation CM/ECF software. It also endorsed an updated policy on wireless
                      communication devices in courthouses and asked for review of the policy by
                      the Judicial Security Committee. In addition, the Committee expressed
                      support for the Codes of Conduct Committeeโs recently issued resource packet
                      to assist courts in developing guidelines for employees on the use of social
                      media.

                       SEARCH AND SEIZURE

                               Guidelines. On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law,
                       the Judicial Conference approved guidelines entitled, โSearch and Seizure
                       Guidelines for United States Probation Officers in the Supervision of
                       Offenders on Supervised Release or Probation,โ to replace model search and
                       seizure guidelines adopted in 1993 (JCUS-MAR 93, p. 13). The new
                       guidelines reflect developments in case law, best practices, and updates to
                       administrative policies and procedures.

                               Use-of-Force Policy. In September 2002, the Judicial Conference
                       approved a use-of-force continuum to govern self-defense responses by
                       probation and pretrial services officers (JCUS-SEP 02, p. 44). Noting that
                       certain provisions of that policy might conflict with provisions in the new
                       search and seizure guidelines, the Committee recommended that the
                       Conference approve revisions to the use-of-force policy to allow officers to
                       manage searches as permitted by the new guidelines. The Conference
                       approved the Committeeโs recommendation.

                              On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
                       approved revisions to Monograph 111, The Supervision of Federal
                       Defendants. The monograph, which provides guidance to officers who
                       supervise defendants on pretrial release, was updated to reflect current
                       knowledge in the field of substance abuse and mental health treatment.

                      MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT

                              On recommendation of the Committee on Defender Services, the
                      Judicial Conference approved a Model Code of Conduct for Federal
                      Community Defender Employees, which is based on the code of conduct
                      applicable to federal public defender organization employees, but modified
                      appropriately for non-profit criminal defense organizations. The Conference
                      also approved a new paragraph to be added to the community defender
                      organization (CDO) grant and conditions document that requires CDOs to
                      adopt the code, absent an approved variance from the AO. Finally, the
                      Conference delegated to the Defender Services Committee the authority to
                      make future adjustments to the CDO code that are substantially in accord with
                      the code of conduct applicable to federal public defenders.

                              The Committee recommended and the Conference approved revisions

                       the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. The Committee also
                       reviewed proposed legislation to authorize the High Court of American Samoa
                       to exercise federal criminal jurisdiction, and determined to recommend no
                       change in the 1996 Judicial Conference position expressing a preference for a
                       territorial court in the event Congress chooses to extend federal jurisdiction to
                       the territory. In addition, the Committee reviewed a legislative proposal to
                       establish standards for state court actions on child custody orders affecting
                       military personnel deployed overseas. Noting that the Judicial Conference has
                       opposed legislation that would result in child custody cases being brought in
                       federal court, the Committee asked the AO Director to transmit a letter to
                       Congress suggesting that it consider an amendment to the proposed measure
                       that would clarify the exclusion of such cases from federal courts.

                       (e.g., due to a shortage of judge power or case backlog). The amendment is
                       intended to address a situation where the judgeโs residence, although within
                       the courtโs territorial boundaries, may be located outside the commuting area
                       of the court.

                      JUDICIARY SALARY PLAN PAY-SETTING FLEXIBILITY

                              With limited exceptions, the salary for applicants from outside the
                      federal civil service is set at step 1 of the Judiciary Salary Plan (JSP) grade to
                      which they are appointed. On recommendation of the Committee on Judicial
                      Resources, the Judicial Conference affirmed the interpretation and application
                      of the Judiciary Salary Plan (JSP) non-chambers pay-setting flexibility that
                      would allow an applicant for a court unit executive or second-in-command
                      (e.g., Type II chief deputy/deputy chief) JSP position to be appointed at step 1
                      or above in a grade lower than the highest grade for which the individual is
                      qualified, subject to the following policy provisions:




                                                              22

                       a.       The salary for the higher step may not exceed the corresponding salary
                                for step 1 of the higher grade for which the individual is qualified;

                       b.       If such an employee is subsequently promoted in less than one year
                                from the individualโs appointment date, the promotion may not result
                                in the individualโs salary exceeding the highest grade and step for
                                which the individual was initially eligible;

                       c.       For individuals appointed using this flexibility, the two-step increase
                                JSP promotion rule may not be applied until the employee has worked
                                at the grade and step to which the individual is appointed for one year;
                                and

                       d.       The position must be announced at all possible grades that the
                                appointing officer is considering for the appointment.

                       This pay flexibility allows a court to offer a salary that is not at the highest
                       possible grade or salary for that applicant, but may still be competitive
                       because it is at a higher step than could otherwise be offered in the lower
                       grade.

                       28 U.S.C. ยง 753(a), the Judicial Conference approved the addition of court
                       reporter duties to the judicial assistant position in the chambers of Judge
                       Roberto A. Lange in the District of South Dakota based on the circumstances
                       presented by the court and because it is in the public interest. The approval is
                       limited to the present incumbent judicial assistant in Judge Langeโs chambers.
                       The judicial assistant-court reporter is required to follow all statutory
                       requirements and Judicial Conference policies related to court reporting, as

                              On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
                      amended its telework policy for courts and federal public defender
                      organizations as it relates to teleworkers who work permanently from remote

                      of official duties, and to clarify travel and relocation policies for such
                      employees. Specifically, the Conference revised the current telework policy
                      to โ

                      a.       Define โofficial duty stationโ as the telework site for an employee who

                               defender organization at least twice each biweekly pay period on a

                               during a medical recovery period), and as the site of the employing
                               court or organization for any employee who reports to the court or
                               organization at least twice each biweekly pay period on a regular and
                               recurring basis;

                      b.       Provide that a court or federal public defender organization should
                               establish in its telework policy generally, and in each telework
                               agreement specifically, what, if any, travel reimbursement is
                               authorized when an employee travels to the employing court or

                      c.       Clarify that relocation expenses are not authorized when the official

                              On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference adopted the
                       following policy statement regarding a judgeโs role when presiding in an

                       a.       EDR proceedings are strictly administrative and are not โcases and

                       b.       Judges presiding in EDR matters are functioning in an administrative
                                rather than judicial capacity;

                       c.       Judgesโ decisions in EDR matters must be in conformance with all
                                statutes and regulations that apply to the judiciary, and judges in the
                                EDR context have no authority to declare such statutes or regulations
                                unconstitutional or invalid; and

                       d.       Judges presiding in EDR matters may not compel the participation of
                                or impose remedies upon agencies or entities other than the employing
                                office which is the respondent in such matters.

                       order to stay within the guidelines recommended by the Budget Committee for

                      concurred with the Space and Facilities Committeeโs recommendation that the

                      reported on the development of a guide for judges who have had false liens
                      filed against them, which provides easy-to-follow instructions on requesting
                      representation and taking appropriate action.

                      reported that under the September 2004 Judicial Conference policy regarding
                      the review of magistrate judge position vacancies (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 26),
                      during the period between the Committeeโs December 2009 and June 2010
                      meetings, the Committee chair approved filling nineteen full-time magistrate
                      judge position vacancies. At its June 2010 meeting, the full Committee

                      further review at its December 2010 meeting. The Committee also reviewed a
                      report on long-range planning for the magistrate judges system and agreed to
                      consider, at its December 2010 meeting, several long-range planning issues
                      identified in the report.

                      CAPITAL SECURITY PROGRAM

                              Noting that there are many court facilities that have serious operational
                      and security deficiencies, but might not qualify for funding for a new
                      courthouse, the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference endorse
                      the concept of a Capital Security Program to assist such courts. The program,
                      which would be a collaborative effort between the judiciary and GSA, would
                      fund the retrofitting of certain types of physical security enhancements at
                      locations that are suitable for such improvements. The Conference adopted the
                      Committeeโs recommendation.

                       FIVE-YEAR COURTHOUSE PROJECT PLAN

                                On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
                       approved the Five-Year Courthouse Project Plan for FYs 2012-2016, which
                       (a) adds the courthouse in Los Angeles, California, to the first year of the plan
                       (FY 2012) as it is the only judicial space emergency that has not yet been built
                       and is the judiciaryโs highest space priority; and (b) includes two new projects in
                       the last year of the plan (FY 2016) for which it has been determined sufficient
                       funding exists under the Judicial Conferenceโs rent cap.


                       FEASIBILITY STUDIES

                               Requests for GSA feasibility studies must be approved by the Judicial
                       Conference as Component B projects under the judiciaryโs circuit rent
                       management program (JCUS-SEP 07, pp. 36-37). After reviewing requests for
                       feasibility studies using asset management planning (a methodology approved
                       by the Conference, see JCUS-MAR 08, p. 26) and determining urgency scores
                       for each project, the Committee recommended that the Conference approve
                       GSA feasibility studies for the projects in the following three locations:
                       Hartford, Connecticut; Winston-Salem/Greensboro, North Carolina; and
                       Clarksburg, West Virginia. The Conference approved the Committeeโs
                       recommendation.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Space and Facilities reported that it advised the
                       Administrative Office on procedures for responding to out-of-cycle circuit rent
                       budget Component B requests for housing for newly confirmed judges, and
                       clarified the process through which its space planning and rent management
                       subcommittees deal with requests for feasibility studies. The Committee also
                       discussed the status of the first three tenant alterations projects (in Des Moines,
                       Iowa; Chicago, Illinois; and Washington, D.C.) planned by the courts under the
                       newly granted congressional authorization for the GSA to delegate to the
                       judiciary the authority to perform tenant alterations projects costing up to
                       $100,000.
