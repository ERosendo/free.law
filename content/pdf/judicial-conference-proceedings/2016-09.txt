                       cyclical audit program for courts and federal public defender organizations.


              COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
              OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

                       CONTINUING NEED FOR BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIPS

                               In accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 152(b)(3), the Judicial Conference
                       conducts a comprehensive review of all judicial districts every other year to
                       assess the continuing need for authorized bankruptcy judgeships. By
                       December 31 of each even-numbered year, the Judicial Conference reports to
                       Congress its findings and any recommendations for the elimination of an
                       authorized bankruptcy judgeship position that can be eliminated when a
                       vacancy exists by reason of resignation, retirement, removal, or death. On
                       recommendation of the Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy
                       System, which relied on the results of the 2016 continuing need survey, the
                       Conference agreed to take the following actions:

                       a.       Recommend to Congress that no bankruptcy judgeship be statutorily
                                eliminated; and

                       b.       Advise the appropriate circuit judicial councils with respect to the
                                districts of Alaska, California-Central, California-Eastern,
                                California-Northern, California-Southern, Illinois-Central,
                                Iowa-Northern, Iowa-Southern, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New
                                York-Eastern, New York-Southern, New York-Western, North
                                Carolina-Middle, Ohio-Northern, Ohio-Southern, Oklahoma-Northern,
                                Oklahoma-Western, Oregon, Pennsylvania-Eastern, and South Dakota,
                                to consider not filling vacancies that currently exist or may occur
                                because of resignation, retirement, removal, or death, until there is a
                                demonstrated need to do so.


                       MULTI-DISTRICT DESIGNATION
                       OF A BANKRUPTCY JUDGE

                               Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 152(d), a bankruptcy judge may be designated to
                       serve in any district adjacent to or near the district for which the judge was

                                                               7
Judicial Conference of the United States                                               September 13, 2016

                       appointed โ[w]ith the approval of the Judicial Conference and of each of the
                       judicial councils involved....โ The Committee noted that designating a
                       bankruptcy judge to serve in multiple districts that need judicial assistance but
                       not a full-time resident judgeship would be a cost-effective way of allocating
                       judicial resources. In order to assist circuits with the process for obtaining
                       Conference approval of a multi-district designation, the Committee
                       recommended, and the Judicial Conference approved, Guidelines for the
                       Multi-District Designation of a Bankruptcy Judge, and delegated to the
                       Bankruptcy Committee authority to make non-substantive, technical, and
                       conforming changes to the Guidelines, as needed.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System
                       reported that it is monitoring the judgeship vacancy pilot project, which was
                       approved by the Judicial Conference in September 2014 (JCUS-SEP 14, p. 7).
                       Two judges were appointed in districts that otherwise would have left the
                       judgeships vacant and then loaned via intercircuit assignment to districts with
                       immediate needs for additional bankruptcy judgeships. The Committee has
                       also worked to seek bankruptcy courts to participate in its horizontal
                       consolidation pilot, which was approved by the Judicial Conference in March
                       2016 (JCUS-MAR 16, p. 8).


              COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
                       FISCAL YEAR 2018 BUDGET REQUEST

                               After considering the FY 2018 budget requests of the program
                       committees, the Budget Committee recommended to the Judicial Conference a
                       request of $6,942.2 million in discretionary appropriations, which is
                       3.9 percent above assumed discretionary appropriations for FY 2017 but
                       $44.9 million below the funding levels requested by the program committees.
                       The Judicial Conference approved the Budget Committeeโs budget request for
                       FY 2018, subject to amendments necessary as a result of (a) new legislation,




                                                               8

                       Committee considers necessary and appropriate.1


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Budget Committee reported that it discussed the status of the
                       FY 2017 appropriations cycle and its joint congressional outreach efforts with
                       the Committee on the Judicial Branch. The Budget Committee also expressed
                       support for ongoing cost-containment efforts and discussed the challenges
                       facing the judiciary with regard to enhancing cybersecurity and replacing
                       aging physical access control systems and how those efforts are being funded.


              COMMITTEE ON CODES OF CONDUCT
                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that since its last report
                       to the Judicial Conference in March 2016, the Committee received 30 new
                       written inquiries and issued 27 written advisory responses. During this period,
                       the average response time for requests was 15 days. In addition, the
                       Committee chair responded to 33 informal inquiries, individual Committee
                       members responded to 134 informal inquiries, and Committee counsel
                       responded to 876 informal inquiries, for a total of 1043 informal inquiries.


              COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
              AND CASE MANAGEMENT

                        CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM ACT REPORTS

                                In September 2009, the Judicial Conference approved making all
                        Civil Justice Reform Act (CJRA) reports created after September 30, 2009
                        available free of charge on the judiciaryโs public website, uscourts.gov


              1
               Subsequent to the Conference session, the Executive Committee approved an adjustment to
              the FY 2018 budget request to add $10 million for emergency repairs to the Thurgood
              Marshall Federal Judiciary Building. With this addition, the FY 2018 request is $6,952.2
              million which is 4.1 percent above the FY 2017 assumed appropriation.

                                                               9
Judicial Conference of the United States                                               September 13, 2016

                        (JCUS-SEP 09, p. 12). CJRA reports created before that date remained
                        available only on PACER for a fee. At this session, noting that the pre-2009
                        reports are accessed by a limited number of PACER users and require the
                        expenditure of judiciary resources to maintain, the Committee on the Court
                        Administration and Case Management recommended that the Conference
                        make all CJRA reports available free of charge on uscourts.gov. The
                        Conference adopted the Committeeโs recommendation.


                        ELECTRONIC PUBLIC ACCESS FEE EXEMPTION

                                 The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                        recommended that the Judicial Conference amend Item 8 of the Electronic
                        Public Access Fee Schedule, effective April 1, 2017, to allow Chapter 13
                        bankruptcy trustees to download quarterly, free of charge, a list of the trusteeโs
                        cases from the PACER Case Locator. The Committee noted that this would
                        facilitate the trusteesโ compliance with annual case reconciliation
                        requirements and relieve clerksโ offices of work they do to assist trustees in
                        compiling the necessary information. The Conference adopted the
                        Committeeโs recommendation.


                        MISCELLANEOUS FEE SCHEDULES

                                Inflationary Fee Increases. The Judicial Conference prescribes
                        miscellaneous fees for the courts of appeals, district courts, United States
                        Court of Federal Claims, bankruptcy courts, and Judicial Panel on
                        Multidistrict Litigation, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1913, 1914, 1926, 1930, and
                        1932, respectively. On recommendation of the Court Administration and Case
                        Management Committee, the Conference raised many of these fees to account
                        for inflation, as set forth below, effective December 1, 2016. The last time
                        miscellaneous fees were increased for inflation was in September 2011.

                        amendments are intended to simplify the fees and more closely align them

                        Judicial Conference approved amending Item 12 of the District Court

                        PRO SE PRISONER E-FILING PILOT PROGRAM

                                To increase the efficiency of processing federal pro se prisoner cases
                        and reduce the associated costs, the Court Administration and Case
                        Management Committee recommended that the Conference approve a
                        one-year joint pilot project with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for a prisoner
                        e-filing program using digital kiosks in BOP facilities. The Committee also
                        recommended that the Conference authorize the Committee, working in
                        conjunction with the Administrative Office, to develop metrics to measure the
                        effectiveness of the program and to issue and amend guidelines to assist pilot
                        participants. The pilot would involve no more than 25 courts and would be
                        limited to civil case filings. The Conference approved the Committeeโs
                        recommendations.


                        JUROR QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE

                                 On recommendation of the Committee on Court Administration and
                        Case Management, the Judicial Conference approved a complete revision to
                        both the style and substance of the Juror Qualification Questionnaire to make
                        it clearer and easier for jurors to understand. The questionnaire has been
                        modified to, among other things, present the questions and corresponding
                        instructions in side-by-side columns; move an explanatory paragraph from the
                        back to the front of the questionnaire; simplify language; and allow for local
                        variation in the identification of political subdivisions in answers to questions
                        about a jurorโs residence.

                        COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                 The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                        reported that it reviewed an interim report from its cost-containment
                        subcommittee (which includes representation from six Judicial Conference
                        committees) on the subcommitteeโs efforts to develop and evaluate
                        organizational models that could contain costs. The Committee also approved
                        a memorandum encouraging courts to consider adopting guidelines aimed at
                        preventing court documents from being used to identify government
                        cooperators. In addition, the Committee agreed to pursue two new initiatives,
                        one to update guidance on the preservation of judgesโ papers to include
                        guidance for electronic documents, and the other to review how juror
                        utilization statistics are collected and reported.


              COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAW
                       JUDGMENT FORMS IN CRIMINAL CASES

                                On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, the Judicial
                       Conference approved revisions to the judgment forms in criminal cases
                       concerning the imposition of standard conditions of post-conviction
                       supervision. The forms were revised to include (a) new standard conditions
                       approved by the United States Sentencing Commission; (b) an explanation of
                       the relationships between the standard conditions and (i) the purposes of
                       sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553 and (ii) the statutory duties of
                       probation officers pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3603 to monitor and improve the
                       conduct of persons under their supervision; and (c) a new section for a person
                       on supervision to acknowledge receipt of and instruction on his or her
                       conditions of supervision.


                       OVERVIEW OF PROBATION AND SUPERVISED RELEASE
                       CONDITIONS

                               On recommendation of the Committee on Criminal Law, the Judicial
                       Conference approved release of a document entitled โOverview of Probation
                       and Supervised Release Conditionsโ as a resource for defendants, the courts,
                       and other criminal justice practitioners regarding the recommendation,
                       imposition, and implementation of conditions of supervision. It will assist with

                       providing notice to defendants of conditions of supervision that may be
                       imposed; help to ensure that the conditions are clear, legally sound,
                       appropriately tailored, and address the relevant statutory factors; and aid
                       appellate courts when reviewing the conditions in individual cases.


                       PRESENTENCE INVESTIGATION REPORT

                                The Committee on Criminal Law recommended that the Conference
                       approve two amendments to the Presentence Investigation Report (Monograph
                       107), Guide to Judiciary Policy, Vol. 8, Pt. D, concerning (a) when to disclose
                       special conditions and (b) the timing for making a recommendation of special
                       conditions. The first amendment would provide that a probation officer should
                       attach any recommended special conditions and the reasons for the
                       recommendations when the presentence report is initially disclosed and when
                       the final report is disclosed, unless such disclosures are limited by the court, to
                       give parties an opportunity to object and present arguments on why certain
                       conditions should or should not be imposed. The second amendment provides
                       examples of when it may be appropriate for probation officers to defer
                       recommending special conditions. The Conference approved the Committeeโs
                       recommendation.


                       SUPERVISION OF FEDERAL OFFENDERS

                                On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved an
                       amendment to the Supervision of Federal Offenders (Monograph 109), Guide
                       to Judiciary Policy, Vol. 8, Pt. E, concerning the privilege against
                       self-incrimination during interviews between probation officers and offenders.
                       The amendment provides guidance to probation officers that if a defendant
                       refuses to answer a specific question during an interview on the grounds that it
                       is incriminating, the officer should not compel the defendant to answer. If
                       there is uncertainty about whether the invocation of the privilege against
                       self-incrimination is valid, the probation officer should refer the matter to the
                       court to make this determination.

                       Conference adopted a new Part L to Volume 8 of the Guide to Judiciary
                       Policy, setting forth judiciary policies related the SCA and JATA as well as
                       guidance for probation and pretrial services officers related to procurement of
                       and expenditure of funds on such services.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Criminal Law reported that it received an update on
                       the Administrative Officeโs continuing efforts to monitor outcomes in
                       post-conviction supervision cases. Those outcomes show improvements that
                       coincide with the considerable investments in evidence-based practices made
                       by the federal probation and pretrial services system. The Committee was also
                       provided with the final report of the FJCโs study of a federal reentry court
                       program model policy as implemented in five participating districts. The
                       Committee agreed to release the report to the courts while it continued to
                       consider what recommendations it may offer to the Judicial Conference. To
                       that end, the Committee formed a subcommittee that will develop possible
                       recommendations for the Judicial Conferenceโs consideration.

                       MODEL PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION
                       OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT

                               The Criminal Justice Act (CJA) directs each district court to place in
                       operation a plan for furnishing defense representation for any person financially
                       unable to retain an attorney. 18 U.S.C. ยง 3006A(a). Currently, there are two
                       model plans included in the CJA Guidelines, Guide to Judiciary Policy,
                       Vol. 7A, Ch. 2, to provide courts with guidance in crafting a local plan, the
                       Model Criminal Justice Act Plan, at Appendix 2A and the Model Plan for the
                       Composition, Administration and Management of the CJA Panel, at
                       Appendix 2B. These plans were adopted in 1990 and have not been
                       comprehensively revised since. Noting that CJA policies have evolved in the
                       intervening years to address changes in program needs, legal precedent, and
                       acceptable standards of practice for the legal profession, the Committee on
                       Defender Services recommended that the Judicial Conference adopt a new
                       model plan that consolidates the information from the two existing model plans

                                                              16

                       Committeeโs recommendation, the Conference approved the 2016 Model Plan
                       for Implementation and Administration of the Criminal Justice Act to
                       supersede the existing model plans.


                       PERIODIC REVIEW OF CJA DISTRICT PLANS

                               As noted above, 28 U.S.C. ยง 3006A(a) requires each district court to
                       adopt a plan for furnishing defense representation for persons financially
                       unable to retain an attorney. To ensure that these plans remain up-to-date, on
                       recommendation of the Committee on Defender Services, the Judicial
                       Conference amended the Guide to Judiciary Policy, Vol. 7A, Ch. 2,
                       ยง 210.10.10 by adding subsection (e) to read as follows:

                                 Each district court should review, and amend as appropriate,
                                 the CJA Plan every five years to ensure compliance with the
                                 CJA Guidelines and other relevant Judicial Conference

                       AND AMENDMENTS ACT

                                 The proposed Tribal Law and Order Reauthorization and Amendments
                       Act of 2016, S. 2920, 114th Congress (as introduced on May 11, 2016) would
                       reauthorize several provisions of the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (Pub.
                       L. No. 111-211), as well as address public safety in Indian Country through a
                       number of requirements for data sharing, collaboration, and reporting. The
                       proposed legislation would also require federal public defenders to appoint
                       tribal liaisons, and authorize and encourage them to appoint special assistant
                       federal defenders in districts that include Indian Country to mirror existing
                       positions in U.S. attorneysโ offices. Pursuant to the proposed legislation, the
                       liaisons would undertake duties to promote the administration of justice in
                       Indian Country, including coordinating the defense of federal crimes,
                       coordinating with tribal public defenders in cases with concurrent jurisdiction,
                       providing technical assistance and training, and coordinating with the
                       Administrative Office. The special assistant federal defenders would represent
                       Indian defendants charged with federal crimes in Indian Country and provide
                       technical and other assistance to tribal governments and court systems.

                                The Committee on Defender Services noted that federal defenders
                       often represent clients from Indian Country based on charges previously
                       brought in Tribal Courts and that requiring federal defender involvement in the
                       administration of tribal justice could place conflicting demands on federal
                       defender organizations and potentially create ethical issues. Accordingly, on
                       the recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference agreed to
                       inform Congress that while it recognizes the need for increased defense
                       representation services in Indian Country, legal training to support the right to
                       effective counsel in Indian Country, and funding to support these functions, it
                       opposes Section 109 of the Tribal Law and Order Reauthorization and
                       Amendments Act of 2016 (S. 2920, as introduced on May 11, 2016), or similar
                       legislation, that would create tribal liaisons and special assistant federal
                       defenders, or any requirement for individual federal defender offices to assist
                       with the administration of tribal justice, as this creates possible conflicts in
                       their representational work involving cases arising from Indian Country.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Defender Services reported that it met with the Ad
                       Hoc Committee to Review the Criminal Justice Act Program and received a
                       status update on the comprehensive, impartial review of the CJA program
                       currently underway. The final report is expected to be completed in Spring
                       2017. The Committee also met with Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian
                       Yates and discussed issues of mutual interest and collaboration, as well as
                       Department of Justice policies and practices that have a significant impact on
                       Defender Services program costs. The Committee received an update on the
                       status of the implementation of eVoucher as a national electronic CJA panel
                       management and voucher processing system, recognized the efforts made to
                       deploy the system nationally, and reaffirmed its position that receiving data
                       from the eVoucher system remains a high priority for the Defender Services
                       program.


              COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL-STATE JURISDICTION
                       ARTICLE I IMMIGRATION COURT

                                The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction was asked to consider a
                       draft legislative proposal to create an Article I Immigration Court consisting of
                       an appellate division and trial-level courts that would be administered by the
                       Administrative Office. The proposed court would be created by transferring

                                                              18
Judicial Conference of the United States                                              September 13, 2016

                       the adjudicatory responsibilities currently performed by the Executive Office
                       for Immigration Review in the Department of Justice to the judiciary, including
                       functions of the Board of Immigration Appeals.

                                The Judicial Conference has a long-standing position opposing, with
                       limited exceptions, specialized courts in the judiciary (JCUS-SEP 90, p. 82;
                       JCUS-SEP 86, p. 60; JCUS-SEP 62, p. 54). With regard to an earlier
                       legislative proposal to create an Article I Immigration Court, the Conference
                       took no position on the merits of creating such a court, but stated that if
                       Congress determined that there is a need for a separate Immigration Court,
                       โconsistent with its previously enunciated recommendations on the creation of
                       a Social Security Court, or a Court of Veterans Appeals, under Article I of the
                       Constitution...the court be created within the Executive Branch of
                       Governmentโ (JCUS-SEP 82, pp. 63-64). Consistent with these positions, and
                       noting specific concerns regarding the draft proposal, including whether the
                       judiciary had resources available to handle the high volume of immigration
                       cases, what effect removing Attorney General discretion over the adjudication
                       of immigration cases would have on the adjudication process, and possible
                       constitutional and administrative concerns, the Committee recommended that
                       the Conference reaffirm its long-standing position that if Congress determines
                       there is a need to create an Article I Immigration Court, such court be
                       established in the executive branch, and further, oppose placement of an
                       Article I Immigration Court in the federal judiciary or the administration of an
                       Article I Immigration Court by the federal judiciary. The Conference adopted
                       the Committeeโs recommendation.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction reported that it continued
                       its discussion of legislation that would make changes in the manner in which
                       courts review claims that non-diverse defendants have been fraudulently joined
                       for the purpose of defeating diversity jurisdiction. The Committee also
                       reviewed legislation that would reverse judicial doctrines that currently provide
                       deference to certain decisions of administrative agencies. The Committee
                       received an update on the progress of a project to update the 1997 Manual for
                       Cooperation Between State and Federal Courts, engaged in a roundtable
                       discussion of ways to enhance communication between the federal judiciary
                       and state courts, and received a report on the Civil Justice Initiative sponsored
                       by the Conference of Chief Justices and the National Center for State Courts.

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Financial Disclosure reported that the
                       Administrative Officeโs comprehensive assessment of the future needs for the
                       electronic financial disclosure report preparation and filing system has been
                       completed and that software currently being utilized by the government was
                       selected and will be customized for the judiciary. The Committee continued its
                       comprehensive review of the financial disclosure regulations. It clarified the
                       filing instructions regarding the deadline for employees filing initial reports,
                       and it analyzed, and requested additional research about, the instructions for
                       reporting property held in a business or trade.

                               As of June 6, 2016, for calendar year 2015, the Committee had received
                       3,256 financial disclosure reports and certifications (out of a total of 4,027
                       required to be filed) from nominee, initial, annual and final filers; and, for
                       calendar year 2014, the Committee had received 4,411 financial disclosure
                       reports and certifications (out of a total of 4,419 required to be filed) from
                       nominee, initial, annual, and final filers.


               COMMITTEE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
                       LONG RANGE PLAN FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

                               Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 612 and on recommendation of the Committee
                       on Information Technology, the Judicial Conference approved the fiscal year
                       2017 update to the Long Range Plan for Information Technology in the
                       Federal Judiciary. Funds for the judiciaryโs information technology program
                       will be spent in accordance with this plan.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Information Technology reported that it
                       recommended additional funding be sought in FY 2017 and beyond for
                       ongoing cybersecurity risk mitigation initiatives and to implement additional
                       programs, tools, services, and staffing to safeguard the judiciaryโs data and
                       systems. The Committee also endorsed language clarifying that parties
                       identified in security policies are responsible for developing and implementing

                       procedures, rather than for the outcomes of the application of those procedures;
                       strongly supported the use of a proposed scorecard as a mandatory information
                       technology security self-assessment tool; and, recognizing the cost of
                       upgrading existing internet connectivity, asked that judges and court staff be
                       reminded of the costs associated with accessing streaming audio and video sites
                       over the DCN and requested that further analysis of streaming be conducted
                       following this reminder.


               COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS

                       JUDGE SHARING PILOT PROGRAM

                               The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments recommended that the
                       Conference approve a voluntary judge sharing pilot program that would assist
                       courts with high weighted caseloads in obtaining long-term assistance through
                       intracircuit assignments from judges in courts with low weighted caseloads.
                       Judges in the lending court who agreed to participate through an intracircuit
                       assignment would take a specified number of civil cases directly from the draw
                       of the borrowing court and would handle those cases from filing to conclusion.
                       Assignment of cases would be random, and participation in the pilot would not
                       affect a courtโs requests for additional judgeship resources. For aspects of the
                       arrangement not specified by pilot program requirements, a memorandum of
                       understanding between the chief district judges of the borrowing and lending
                       courts, approved by the chief circuit judge, would govern. The Judicial
                       Conference adopted the recommendation of the Committee and approved the
                       creation of a judge sharing pilot program in up to five circuits for three years,
                       to be administered by the Committee on Intercircuit Assignments.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that
                       105 intercircuit assignments were undertaken by 76 Article III judges from
                       January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016. During this time, the Committee continued
                       to disseminate information about intercircuit assignments and aided courts
                       requesting assistance by identifying and obtaining judges willing to take
                       assignments. The Committee also reviewed and concurred with two proposed
                       intercircuit assignments of bankruptcy judges.

                       involvement in rule of law and judicial reform throughout the world,
                       highlighting activities in Africa, Europe and Eurasia, Latin America, the
                       Middle East, and East and South Asia. Briefing reports about international rule

              COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
                       REPORTING OF NON-CASE RELATED TRAVEL

                               In March 1999, the Judicial Conference adopted a policy requiring all
                       federal judges to report annually their non-case related professional travel
                       (Travel Regulations for Justices and Judges, Guide to Judiciary Policy, Vol.
                       19, Ch. 2, ยง 270; JCUS-MAR 99, pp. 19-20). At this session, on
                       recommendation of the Committee on the Judicial Branch, the Judicial
                       Conference approved changing the name of the policy from โReporting of
                       Non-Case Related Travel,โ to โReporting of Governance and Education
                       Travel,โ to more accurately describe the nature and purpose of the travel that is
                       reportable.

                               The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that it participated in

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability reported that it
                       discussed and considered complaint-related matters under the Judicial Conduct
                       and Disability Act, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 351-364 (Act), and the Rules for

                       petitions for review of circuit judicial council orders. In addition, the
                       Committee approved changes to the judiciaryโs public judicial conduct and
                       disability website related to the September 2015 amendments to the Rules. The
                       Committee and its staff have continued to address inquiries regarding the Act

              COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES
                       SENIOR JUDGE STAFFING RESOURCES

                                In October 2014, as part of the judiciaryโs continuing cost-containment
                       initiative, the Administrative Officeโs advisory councils and peer advisory
                       groups identified staffing for senior judges among the areas that warranted
                       further analysis. In response, the Committee on Judicial Resources established
                       an ad hoc subcommittee on senior judge staffing resources to oversee the
                       analysis, and the Director of the Administrative Office established a Senior
                       Judges Working Group to provide additional assistance and input.

                               A major goal of the effort was the identification of common statistical
                       measures in an attempt to bring greater standardization and rigor to the senior
                       judge staff certification process. After reviewing historical data and each
                       circuitโs standards for certifying staff for senior judges, the ad hoc
                       subcommittee, in consultation with the working group, concluded that national
                       guidelines would negatively impact existing practices and processes, but agreed
                       that circuits should regularly review their certification process. To facilitate
                       that review, the subcommittee recommended that the Committee ask the

                       judges and circuit executives in assessing and evaluating staffing needs for
                       senior judges. The Report contains recommendations on establishing a robust
                       and transparent process for senior judge staffing allocation. The Conference
                       adopted the Committeeโs recommendation.

                       (c) chief deputy (appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts), and (d) deputy
                       chief (probation/pretrial services officer), have time-in-grade or equivalent
                       experience requirements. In order to be eligible for promotion to the next
                       higher grade, employees in these positions must have 52 weeks of experience at
                       or equivalent to the next lower grade. These requirements are not mandated for

                       flexibility, the Committee recommended, and the Judicial Conference

                       for all JSP unit executive and second-in-command positions upon qualification
                       and grade determination.


                       UPDATE TO PROBATION OFFICES STAFFING FORMULA

                               A new staffing formula for probation offices was recommended by the
                       Committee on Judicial Resources and approved by the Judicial Conference in
                       September 2015 that included a standard factor for all districts for the
                       preparation of guideline presentence reports (JCUS-SEP 15, p. 24). At the
                       time, the Committee noted that it intended to revisit that factor in the near
                       future and develop case weights that would reflect the complexity of these
                       reports. At this session, on recommendation of the Committee on Judicial
                       Resources, the Judicial Conference amended the portion of the staffing formula
                       for probation offices relating to the preparation of guideline presentence reports
                       by replacing the constant of 2.66 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and an
                       additional 38.85 hours per guideline presentence report with a constant of 1.00
                       FTE position and weighted values based on the nature of the offenses of

                       criminal events in a clientโs history.


                       DEFENDER SERVICES NATIONAL PROJECTS POSITIONS

                                The judiciaryโs Defender Services program includes national projects
                       that serve as shared operational expertise for federal judges, federal defender
                       organization staff, Criminal Justice Act panel attorneys, and the Administrative
                       Office by providing consultation, assistance, and training on specialized topics
                       critical to high quality representation for indigent federal criminal defendants.
                       To provide greater availability and access to these capabilities, on
                       recommendation from the Committee on Defender Services, the Committee on
                       Judicial Resources recommended that the Conference approve adding nine FTE
                       staff positions for the Defender Services national projects to be funded as soon
                       as fiscally possible, but no later than fiscal year 2018, as follows:

                       a.       one position (paralegal) for the National Litigation Support Team;

                       b.       three positions (attorney, investigator/mitigation specialist, paralegal)
                                for the Capital Resource Counsel Project;

                       c.       two positions (paralegal and research and writing specialist) for the
                                Federal Capital Appellate Resource Counsel Project;

                       d.       one position (investigator/mitigation specialist) for the Federal Capital
                                (ยง 2255) Project; and

                       e.       two positions (infrastructure architect/engineer and project manager) for
                                the National Information Technology Operation and Applications
                                Development Project.

                       The Conference approved the Committeeโs recommendation.


                       CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT PANEL MANAGEMENT RESOURCES

                               Although in most districts the clerk of court performs a majority of
                       Criminal Justice Act (CJA) panel management work, many federal defender
                       offices (FDOs) also perform this work as a service to the court. The
                       Committee on Judicial Resources recommended that the Judicial Conference
                       approve the addition of 13.96 FTE positions to the currently approved FDO

                                                                25

                       staffing formulas for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to be distributed to fifteen
                       designated FDOs to stabilize CJA panel management support. The Committee
                       noted that it will consider an update to the district clerksโ offices staffing
                       formula in June 2018 for use in fiscal year 2019, and the work measurement
                       study for that update will likely lead to a more equitable distribution of the CJA
                       management workload between the district clerksโ offices and FDOs. The
                       Conference approved the Committeeโs recommendation.


                       MITIGATION SPECIALIST POSITION

                               At the request of the Committee on Defender Services, the Committee
                       on Judicial Resources recommended that the Judicial Conference include a
                       position description for a non-capital mitigation specialist and a capital
                       mitigation specialist in the Defender Organization Classification System, the
                       personnel classification system for the judiciaryโs Defender Services program.
                       Among other things, a mitigation specialist assists appointed CJA counsel in
                       investigating, analyzing, developing, and presenting any mitigation evidence
                       that exists in the life history of a client and gathers information to present a
                       more complete picture of the client throughout the court proceedings. The
                       Conference approved the Committeeโs recommendation.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Judicial Resources reported that it submitted a
                       FY 2018 budget request for programs under its jurisdiction to the Budget
                       Committee that was equivalent to a 3.0 percent increase over the FY 2017
                       baseline, which would result in 12,027 FTE positions for court support staff.
                       Subsequently, the Budget Committee adjusted the request to limit funding for
                       court support staffing to 11,845 FTE positions. The Judicial Resources
                       Committee declined a request for conversion of a Navajo staff court interpreter
                       position to a Spanish staff court interpreter position in the District of New
                       Mexico. The Committee also received an update on the schedule of delivery
                       dates for current and future work measurement studies, including the upcoming
                       district clerksโ offices work measurement study.

                               The Committee on Judicial Security reported that it was updated on the
                       status of the courthouse Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) program,
                       including the United States Marshals Service (USMS) development of a
                       national standard for PACS systems in federal courthouses and coordination of
                       a risk-based budget strategy for examining and prioritizing PACS replacements
                       and upgrades in federal judiciary facilities. The Committee also heard
                       presentations from Director L. Eric Patterson, Federal Protective Service, and
                       Acting Director David Harlow, USMS, regarding issues relevant to their
                       agenciesโ respective roles in protecting court facilities. Finally, the Committee
                       discussed the status of the Home Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) program,
                       including the new national contract service provider, Securitas Electronic
                       Security, Inc., which assumed contractual duties from Diebold.

                       establishing standards and procedures for the appointment and reappointment
                       of United States magistrate judges, Guide to Judiciary Policy, Vol. 3, Ch. 4,
                       ยง 420, to (a) ensure that merit selection panel members have written notice of
                       the restriction against being considered for a magistrate judge position within
                       one year of concluding service on the panel; (b) require waivers from this
                       restriction to be requested by the chair of the merit selection panel; (c) clarify
                       that the restriction applies to members of merit selection panels for the
                       reappointment, as well as the appointment, of magistrates judges; (d) establish
                       criteria for the Committeeโs consideration of a requested waiver; (e) require the
                       merit selection panel to indicate in its report to the court whether any of the
                       applicants were former merit selection panel members who had been granted a
                       waiver; (f) provide that a court may recommend more than five applicants if the

                       RECALL REGULATIONS

                                Under the regulations governing the ad hoc and extended service recall
                       of retired magistrate judges, Guide to Judiciary Policy, Vol. 3, Ch. 11, ยง 1120,
                       and Ch. 12, ยง 1220, the Magistrate Judges Committee must approve any
                       request for staff for recalled magistrate judges and any request for funds for
                       recall of a retired magistrate judge that exceeds $10,000 in judicial salary,
                       Office of Personnel Management annuity reimbursement, travel and
                       subsistence (JCUS-SEP 12, p. 28). The regulations also set forth the criteria
                       the Committee should consider in deciding whether to approve such a request.
                       At this session, the Committee recommended that the Conference add two new
                       criteria for determining whether to approve funds for recalled magistrate judges
                       or their staff: the comparative need of the district judges for the assistance of
                       magistrate judges and the overall workload of the court; and the commitment
                       of the court to the effective utilization of magistrate judges. The Conference
                       adopted the Committeeโs recommendation.


                       CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE JUDGE POSITIONS

                               After considering the recommendations of the Committee on the
                       Administration of the Magistrate Judges System and the views of the
                       Administrative Office, the district courts, and the judicial councils of the
                       circuits, the Judicial Conference agreed to (a) authorize the conversion of the
                       part-time magistrate judge position at Williamsport in the Middle District of
                       Pennsylvania to a full-time magistrate judge position; and (b) redesignate the
                       location of the part-time magistrate judge position at Middletown to
                       Poughkeepsie in the Southern District of New York.


                       ACCELERATED FUNDING

                              On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to
                       designate for accelerated funding, effective April 1, 2017, the new full-time
                       magistrate judge position at Williamsport in the Middle District of
                       Pennsylvania.

                       reported that it considered ten cyclical district-wide magistrate judge survey
                       reports prepared by the Administrative Office and determined not to
                       recommend any changes in the number, locations, salaries, or arrangements of
                       the magistrate judge positions in those district courts. Pursuant to Judicial
                       Conference policy regarding the review of magistrate judge position vacancies
                       (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 26), for the period between its December 2015 and June
                       2016 meetings, the Committee, through its chair, approved filling 12 full-time
                       magistrate judge position vacancies in 11 courts. At its June 2016 meeting, the
                       full Committee considered requests to fill two magistrate judge position
                       vacancies. The Committee approved one of the requests and the second
                       request was later withdrawn by the court. The Committee also considered and
                       approved requests from ten courts for the recall or extension of recall of
                       ten retired magistrate judges.

                               The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                       Judicial Conference proposed amendments to Bankruptcy Rules 1001 (Scope
                       of Rules and Forms; Short Title), 1006 (Filing Fee), and 1015 (Consolidation
                       or Joint Administration of Cases Pending in Same Court), together with
                       Committee Notes explaining their purpose and intent. The Conference
                       approved the proposed amendments and agreed to transmit them to the
                       Supreme Court for consideration with a recommendation that they be adopted
                       by the Court and transmitted to Congress in accordance with law.

                               The Committee also submitted to the Judicial Conference proposed
                       revisions to Bankruptcy Official Forms 20A (Notice of Motion or Objection)
                       and 20B (Notice of Objection to Claim) (renumbered as 420A and 420B) and

                       Charges) and recommended that they take effect on December 1, 2016, and that
                       they govern all proceedings in bankruptcy cases thereafter commenced and,
                       insofar as just and practicable, all proceedings then pending. The Conference
                       adopted the Committeeโs recommendation.

                       CIVIL LITIGATION PILOT PROJECTS

                                As part of an ongoing effort to reduce the cost and delay of federal civil
                       litigation, the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference approve
                       two civil litigation pilot projects, each for a period of approximately three years
                       in at least three to five districts. The first project, the Mandatory Initial
                       Discovery Pilot Project, would test a system of mandatory initial discovery
                       requests to be adopted in each participating court by standing order. It would
                       apply to all civil cases except those exempted by Rule 26(a)(1)(B), patent cases
                       governed by a local rule, and cases transferred for consolidated administration
                       in the district by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The second
                       project, the Expedited Procedures Pilot Project, would test the effectiveness of
                       strict court-wide application of practices that under current rules have proved
                       effective in reducing cost and delay. It would involve all cases in which
                       discovery and trial are possible. The pilot projects were developed in
                       consultation with the Committee on Court Administration and Case
                       Management and the Federal Judicial Center. The Committee also
                       recommended that the Conference delegate authority to the Committee on
                       Rules of Practice and Procedure to develop guidelines to implement the pilot
                       projects. The Conference adopted the Committeeโs recommendations.

              COMMITTEE ON SPACE AND FACILITIES
                       COURTHOUSE PROJECT PRIORITIES

                                The Federal Judiciary Courthouse Project Priorities (CPP) list was
                       adopted by the Judicial Conference in September 2015 as the new planning tool
                       for communicating the judiciaryโs priorities for new courthouse construction.
                       Eleven projects were included on the FY 2017 CPP, which was the first time
                       the list was issued. At this session, the Committee on Space and Facilities
                       recommended that the Judicial Conference adopt a FY 2018 CPP. As eight of
                       the 11 projects on the FY 2017 plan were fully funded in the Consolidated
                       Appropriations Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-113, only three projects remained
                       (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Norfolk, Virginia)
                       and were carried forward to the proposed FY 2018 CPP. In addition, after
                       considering feasibility studies conducted by the General Services
                       Administration (GSA), three new projects (Huntsville, Alabama; Fort
                       Lauderdale, Florida; and Hato Rey, Puerto Rico) were recommended for
                       inclusion on the FY 2018 CPP. The Conference adopted the FY 2018 CPP as
                       recommended, with the projects listed in the following priority order:

                       a.       Part I: (1) Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; (2) Huntsville, Alabama; and
                                (3) Fort Lauderdale, Florida; and

                       b.       Part II: All remaining projects (Chattanooga, Tennessee; Hato Rey,
                                Puerto Rico; and Norfolk, Virginia) listed according to urgency
                                evaluation score.


                       FEASIBILITY STUDIES

                               Courthouse constructions projects must have a completed GSA
                       feasibility study prior to being placed on the CPP (JCUS-MAR 08, p. 26).

                                                              31
Judicial Conference of the United States                                             September 13, 2016
                       After considering the urgency evaluation scores for potential projects in
                       McAllen, Texas (Fifth Circuit), Bowling Green, Kentucky (Sixth Circuit), and
                       Green Bay, Wisconsin (Seventh Circuit) and ensuring that the relevant district
                       court and circuit judicial council for each project have given the necessary
                       approvals, the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference approve
                       requests to GSA to perform feasibility studies for these locations. The
                       Conference adopted the Committeeโs recommendation.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Space and Facilities reported that it was updated on
                       the judiciaryโs efforts to reduce by three percent its national footprint by the
                       end of FY 2018. As of June 2016, the judiciary had achieved two-thirds of this
                       goal. While this progress is commendable, all circuits must continue to focus
                       on space reduction efforts to ensure the national goal is met by the deadline.
                       The Committee was also updated on the status of the judiciaryโs Capital
                       Security Program (CSP) and, in consultation with the Committee on Judicial
                       Security, approved four courthouses for CSP studies in FY 2016: Portland,
                       Maine; Detroit, Michigan; Augusta, Georgia; and Fort Wayne, Indiana.
                       Finally, the Committee discussed the status of the National Joint Training
                       Program that has begun to coordinate and implement the policy changes
                       resulting from the Service Validation Initiative, a collaborative effort on the
                       part of the GSA and the judiciary to improve the quality of the services GSA
                       provides to the courts.


              FUNDING
                               All of the foregoing recommendations that require the expenditure of
                       funds for implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to
                       the availability of funds and to whatever priorities the Conference might
                       establish for the use of available resources.




                                                                    Chief Justice of the United States
                                                                    Presiding
