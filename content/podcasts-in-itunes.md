Just a quick post today to share that our [oral argument podcasts][p] are now available on [iTunes][g].

If you are a user of iTunes, you can easily subscribe to our podcasts by opening iTunes and searching for "Free Law Project" or "oral arguments." Once you subscribe, the podcasts will download to iTunes wherever you use it.

These podcasts contain all of the oral argument audio for a given court or for a search that you create. This means that as of this moment, you can pipe the audio from the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit Courts directly to your pocket with almost no effort.

To learn more about creating custom podcasts or about the podcasts that we already have, we've created a [page on our site with all the details][p]. It also has information about how to subscribe using Google Music, Stitcher Radio, and other apps.

We hope you'll enjoy these podcasts. Who doesn't want the Supreme Court in their pocket?
