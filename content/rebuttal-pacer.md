On September 26th, Judge Fleissig, the Chair of the Judicial Conference Committee on Court Administration and Case Management (CACM), presented testimony to the House Judicial Committee's Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet. In her [written testimony][written], she makes a number of statements that we disagree with and that we believe stem from a lack of ambition for the PACER system and a lack of understanding of the technical world.

In this piece, we rebut her statements so that she, other legislators, and the public can have an alternate view of these statements.[^1] 

Fleissig's general thesis is that changing PACER is impossible. Any change would cost too much and would be too difficult. We diagree. There comes a time when something gets so bad that it has to be uprooted, and some change becomes necessary. PACER and CM/ECF have reached that point. 

Let's go through her points one by one. She begins with the header that:

> The PACER system provides free access to most users

Unfortunately there are a number of issues here, but the whopper is that: The AO is measuring "users" when they should be measuring "Americans." PACER does *not* provide adequate access to the general public because of how difficult it is to use, and the AO has done nothing to measure the untapped interest in court documents or judicial proceedings. Sure, a majority of "Users" don't wind up paying in a given quarter â€” But how many Americans were interested in court information and never knew how to find it? For that matter, how many "Users" stay in the free tier simply because using the system is so painful they give up before having to make a payment?

The larger issue here though is that at the outset of Fleissig's testimony, she conflates PACER with CM/ECF. This mistake is made repeatedly by innumerable people (myself included), but it's a surprise to see this conflation being made by the Chair of the Judicial Conference Committee on Court Administration and Case Management. Let's get this out of the way:

1. **CM/ECF**: The system that attorneys and pro se filers use to upload filings and maintain a database of those filings.
 
1. **PACER**: The *access system* that the public can use to access CM/ECF. 

Repeat after me: There *is no PACER system*. There is only public access to CM/ECF. Remember this framing because it will come up again later.

She says:

> (1) Judicial opinions are available free of charge;

Well, kind of. In theory. It depends on whether the clerk that uploads it into the system has checked the right box, and [our study][opinions] of the issue has indicated that in practice this is very irregular. Some courts do a great job remembering to mark opinions as free. Other courts do a rotten one. What's worse is that when mistakes are made, there's no way to revert a fee that's charged to your account. You can call the PACER Service Center and complain that the document is labeled as an "Opinion". You can ask the clerk at the service center to look at the very document and read its heading to you (I have), but if the item is not marked as a free opinion by the judge, this is the conversation you will likely have (as I did):

You: "But it says 'Opinion' right at the top."

Service Center Clerk: "If it's not marked as an opinion by the judge, then it's not an opinion."

You: "Even when it's labeled as an opinion?"

Service Center Clerk: "I'm sorry, this document is not an opinion."

You: "!?"

It'd be funny if it were not so common and were it not affecting democratic access to the courts.


> (2) Parties in a case (including pro se litigants) and attorneys of record receive one free copy of all documents filed in their cases;

Wowee, one free copy. After that, to participate in your own case, you have to pay to download documents. Even if you put them into CM/ECF in the first place. This is not something to celebrate or brag about.


> (3) No fee is charged for viewing case information or documents at courthouse public access terminals;

Yes, but if you want to print those same documents, you must pay. And in many states the distance to a courthouse can be prohibitive. Having to drive to a court, sit in a chair, and print paper documents is also not something to brag about. It's a loophole to a fee schedule, little more. 


> [...] the fee schedule [also] allows courts to exempt certain people or categories of people from payment>

But if you use this process, you won't be able to share the documents you download, and the problems with this process deserve an entire post on their own. Suffice to say, this system only works to provide the smallest of loopholes for the public access this content. 


She goes on:

> Revenue from PACER fees is expected to be approximately $145.2 million during the current FY 2019

This deserves to be repeated:

> Revenue from PACER fees is expected to be approximately $145.2 million during the current FY 2019

The Administrative Office of the Courts has a Congressional mandate to create a public access system. They're allowed to charge the public fees to access it. As a result, they created CM/ECF, and created the PACER access system on top of it. The fact that this system is making (and apparently costing), nearly $150,000,000 *per year* should be cause for reflection. One-hundred-and-fifty-million dollars is an extraordinarily expensive website.

A few years ago, along with a colleague I completed expert testimony that calculated an estimate of how much it would cost to run PACER, based on a modern cloud computing architecture. [We calculated about $200,000][expert-testimony]. That number doesn't include staffing, but you can pay a lot of people with the remaining $145 million dollars remaining.    

> These funds are also vital to the development of Next Generation CM/ECF (NextGen)

NextGen has been rolling out to courts for a few years now and is the big thing the courts are talking about in [the quarterly newsletters][news]. The only feature it appears to offer is centralized login for all of CM/ECF and PACER. It is not a next generation or a major overhaul like the branding might lead you to believe. It provides no additional features (besides login) that we're aware of.

> To improve PACER further, the Judiciary is establishing an EPA Public Users Group. 

We fully support and embrace this effort and we hope that it is a huge success and that our public criticisms of PACER move our application to the top, not the bottom of the stack.
