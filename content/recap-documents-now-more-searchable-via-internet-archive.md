We recently made a small change to the way that documents uploaded by
RECAP users are made available on the Internet Archive. Until today, the
Internet Archive had served primarily as a bulk hosting provider,
without much ability to browse or search the archive. This was enforced
in two ways: First, it was not possible to search for documents using
the Internet Archive's search tools. Second, external search engines
were prevented from indexing the site. We decided to do this in order to
be especially cautious with respect to privacy concerns that we have
[previously
discussed]({filename}/accessing-the-recap-repository-without-pacer.md).

Since we launched, we have spent a great deal of time examining these
issues, and we decided to make a small incremental step in making the
documents more findable without (yet) allowing in-depth full-text search
of all documents. We have enabled Internet Archive indexing, as well as
search engine indexing, for the case summary pages on the Internet
Archive. That means, for example, that the relatively limited
information on the [AT&T v. Hepting case summary
page](http://www.archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.cand.175966/) is now
searchable.

You can find this case through the Internet Archive search engine by
doing a query like this:
[http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=collection:usfederalcourts AND
hepting](http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3Ausfederalcourts%20AND%20hepting)

You can find this case through a Google query like this:
[http://www.google.com/\#&q=site:archive.org usfederalcourts
hepting](http://www.google.com/#&q=site:archive.org%20usfederalcourts%20hepting)

As we continue to gain a better understanding of the privacy issues at
stake, we will likely make further improvements to this system. We
welcome your feedback.
