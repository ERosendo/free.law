We are proud to announce beta version
0.7 of RECAP. This release adds
support for Firefox 4 beta, for those of you living on the cutting edge.

We've also added a feature [requested by our
users](http://recapthelaw.uservoice.com/forums/26501-general/suggestions/420665-provide-a-link-to-recap-docket-from-pacer-case-sum?ref=title).
Before this release, the only way to see if RECAP had any free documents
for a particular case was to purchase and examine the docket report for
that case. In version 0.7, RECAP will notify you before you run a docket
report if there is already free archived docket available. On the docket
query page for a case that has archived information, you should see a
box appear at the bottom of your screen. Clicking on that link will take
you to RECAP's summary page, which includes any docket information we
have on the case as well as links to any documents we may have. Here's
an example of what you should see:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="{static}/images/recap/DocketPreview-300x203.png"
         alt="Visual of new RECAP
              feature">
</div>


Version 0.7 also fixes a number of bugs, both minor and major. Thanks to
a few extremely helpful users, we were able to fix a problem that
prevented RECAP from working correctly behind certain types of proxy
servers. Users behind a corporate proxy or firewall should be sure to
upgrade.

Finally, this release marks the first version of RECAP to be hosted on
addons.mozilla.org. Transitioning to addons will allow us to more
quickly add support for new versions of Firefox.

If youâ€™re an existing Firefox user, Firefox periodically checks for
updates to extensions and should automatically fetch the new version of
the RECAP extension. Or you can force it to check immediately by
clicking Tools-&gt;Extensions-&gt;Find Updates (or, depending on your
Firefox version, Tools-&gt;Add-Ons-&gt;Find Updates). As always, please
[let us know](mailto:info@free.law) if you find any bugs.
