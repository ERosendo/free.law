One of the ideas behind the RECAP project is that once government data
is made accessible in a free and open format, people will find useful
new ways to search and process that data. We have heard from many folks
looking to do interesting things with the documents archived by RECAP,
and last year a group of students built the searchable web-based [RECAP
Archive](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/). Today, Brian Carver shared a
simple tool he built on top of that -- a [Firefox RECAP search
plugin](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/search-engines.html?name=recapthelaw.org).
You know that little search box in the top-right corner of Firefox? If
you install his plugin you can choose the RECAP Archive as one of the
search engines in the drop-down menu, so that finding free federal court
documents is even easier.

Pretty cool!
