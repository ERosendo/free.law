Monday's *Los Angeles Times* has a [great
article](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik28-2009sep28,0,3104293.column)
talking about the growing movement for government transparency. It
focuses on three of our favorite transparency advocates: [Ellen
Miller](http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/people/emiller/), co-founder
of the Sunlight Foundation; Josh Tauberer, a regular at [CITP
conferences](http://citp.princeton.edu/cloud-workshop/), and Carl
Malamud, whose non-profit,
[public.resource.org](http://public.resource.org/), is a key RECAP
partner.

The article discusses RECAP in some detail, describing it as "a sort of
digital Kumbaya." We're always happy to have news outlets help spread
the word about RECAP, and we're also glad that the article makes clear
that RECAP is part of a broader movement for web-enabled government
transparency. Folks like Carl, Josh, and Ellen have been pushing the
envelope on these issues longer than we have.

One minor correction that's worth noting: the article refers to "the
courts' PACER revenue of $10 million a year." In reality, the expected
revenue for 2009 is $87 million. This and many other details about
PACER's budget can be found in RECAP co-author Steve Schultze's
[recently-released
paper](http://managingmiracles.blogspot.com/2009/09/my-new-working-paper-on-pacer.html)
on the subject.

RECAP has been a subject of discussion in other venues as well. *Ars
Technica*
[discussed](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/federal-courts-now-offer-hearings-online-as-mp3-files.ars)
the courts' reaction to RECAP in its story about the PACER service
offering MP3s of court proceedings. And if you happen to be a subscriber
to *Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly* or *New Jersey Law Journal*, you can
