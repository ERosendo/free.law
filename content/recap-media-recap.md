Last week, we got our first major media coverage from across the pond,
as the *Guardian* gave us a [generous
write-up.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/nov/11/recap-us-courtrooms)
They call RECAP "an ingenious twist on peer to peer networking" and
write that "since the system launched in August, legal circles have been
buzzing with support for the idea."

Meanwhile, RECAP continues to generate interest from the legal
profession. Earlier this month, RECAP's own Tim Lee spoke to a group of
New Jersey lawyers about how the software can save their clients money
while expanding access to the public domain. And ***Arizona Attorney***
magazine has an [in-depth
article](http://www.azattorneymag-digital.com/azattorneymag/200911/?pg=5#pg27)
about RECAP and the debate over public access. They write that "there
appears to be nothing illegal about the use of RECAP by those who are
paying PACER users" (we agree). And they conclude that we've "carefully
thought through the ethical implications and goals of the program." We
like to think so. The December issue of ***Virginia Lawyer*** magazine
[profiles
RECAP](http://www.vsb.org/docs/valawyermagazine/vl1209_tech.pdf),
describing in detail the efforts so far to liberate PACER documents.
