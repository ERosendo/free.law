RECAP co-author Steve Schultze is having a busy month. Last week, he
[released](http://managingmiracles.blogspot.com/2009/09/my-new-working-paper-on-pacer.html)
a new
[paper](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/~sjschultze/Schultze_PACER_Budget_Working_Paper.pdf)
called "Electronic Public Access Fees and the United States Federal
Courts’ Budget: An Overview." It provides a comprehensive overview of
PACER's budget. It explains how the courts decide how much to charge for
PACER and how the money is spent. It's an invaluable roadmap for anyone
interested in understanding the debate over PACER's future.

Today, Steve is at the [Gov 2.0
Expo](http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2009) giving a
[talk](http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2009/public/schedule/detail/10445)
about RECAP. If you're at the expo as well, we hope you're planning to
go to the talk, which starts at 10:50. If not, you can see a
pre-recorded version of his talk here:

Finally, next week Steve will start his [new
job](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/steve-schultze-join-citp-associate-director)
as associate director of the Center for Information Technology Policy at
Princeton, which is the home of RECAP and its other co-authors. The rest
of the RECAP team is excited that we’ll soon have Steve as a colleague
as well as a co-author.
