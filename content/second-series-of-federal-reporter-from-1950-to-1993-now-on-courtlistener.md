Over the past few months we have been working on cleaning and importing
the 2nd series of the Federal Reporter (F.2d) from
http://law.resource.org. Today we're excited to share that we've made
over 12,000 meta data additions, corrections or categorizations, and
that we've finally added F2 to our corpus.

This expands our coverage to nearly 600,000 searchable cases, and
improves the quality of bulk data that is available for free on the Web.

We're very excited by these new features, and we hope to import the
third series next. If you're interested in contributing to this work,
please drop us a line - it's a huge task cleaning and importing this
information and we can use all the help we can get!
