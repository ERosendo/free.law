<br>
Many opinions have been shared about income tax since Congress passed the 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1909, and which was ratified by the states in 1913. Here at Free Law Project, we believe few opinions matter as much as the precedential tax opinions produced by the federal courts, first at the Board of Tax Appeals (1924-1942) and later by the United States Tax Court (1942-).  

That is why we are happy to announce that we have compiled, collected and analyzed the complete collection of precedential federal tax opinions. Our collection of tax cases spans two courts, ten decades and comprises nearly twenty-six thousand precedential opinions. We also have over four thousand non-precedential opinions in our database. 

All new projects require improvements and enhancements to our code base, and this one was no different.  We added new tools to analyze and parse tax opinions.  This enables us to find and extract missing, yet relevant information from tax opinions. This grows our already robust dataset, and we think will make your search queries even easier.

Thank you to the Caselaw Access Project at Harvard and [BlueJLegal][bjl] for helping us complete our collection, and of course thank you to everyone involved in our open source projects.

You can get started at [Courtlisteners' Opinion Search][cl], or can also browse decisions of the [Board of Tax Appeals][bta] and the [U.S. Tax Court][tc] by volume and as always explore our [APIs and Bulk Data][api]. 

We hope this makes the upcoming tax season just a little easier on everyone, even the tax lawyers out there.
