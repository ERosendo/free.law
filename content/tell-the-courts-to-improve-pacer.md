One way to promote broader public access to the public record is to use
RECAP to share documents with others. A complimentary approach is to
tell the U.S. Courts directly what should change. Recently, Stanford Law
Librarian [Erika
Wayne](http://www.law.stanford.edu/directory/profile/111/Erika%20V.%20Wayne/)
launched a petition to "[Improve
PACER](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/improve-PACER)," which suggested
several changes:

1.  **Provide document authentication**
   As the raw materials of adjudication become digitized and
    disseminated online, we must have some means of knowing that they
    are genuine. This is a dilemma that [RECAP
    faces]({filename}/pages/recap/faq.md#how-do-i-know-that-the-documents-provided-by-recap-are-genuine) in helping
    users to trust the documents they download.
2.  **Lower costs, improve interfaces**
   Our ultimate goal is to remove PACER's paywall entirely and free the
    database up for third parties to build interfaces. But in the
    meantime, it would certainly benefit the public to gain less
    expensive access to the law through more useful interfaces. The
    petition recommends that the U.S. Courts reduce the transaction
    costs of access, and make that access more usable.
3.  **Free access from Federal Depository Libraries**

Erika will deliver the petition to the Administrative Office of the
Courts in the near future. If you support these goals, consider signing
[the petition](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/improve-PACER).
