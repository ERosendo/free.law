We're thrilled at the reception RECAP has gotten in its first few hours.
Among the notable reactions, Techcrunch
[discusses](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/14/use-recap-to-bypass-court-document-pacer-paywall/)
the legal issues and concludes that using RECAP doesn't violate
copyright law. RECAP is a hot topic of conversation [at
Slashdot.](http://news.slashdot.org/story/09/08/14/1158247/Firefox-Plugin-Liberates-Paywalled-Court-Records)
CNet also [weighed
in](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10310016-38.html), highlighting
one of the challenges RECAP may face in the coming months:

> There are some potential problems. One is that because the RECAP
> developers plan to make the source code available, it wouldn't be hard
> for someone to seed the Internet Archive with "official court
> documents" that had been modified in some way. (The answer is for
> users to pay to download important files from PACER, or for the courts
> to employ digital signatures.)

Techdirt calls RECAP
["ingenious"](http://techdirt.com/articles/20090813/1544075868.shtml),
and concludes that "this is a fantastic idea that hopefully will help to
open up public domain court information that has been locked behind
PACER's paywalls for too long."

Finally, *Ars Technica* does its [usual thorough
job](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/08/recap-firefox-extension-builds-crowdsourced-pacer-mirror.ars)
of covering RECAP, writing:

> The RECAP project could also illuminate potential solutions to the
> problems that are blocking a more complete PACER overhaul. Despite
> growing pressure from Congress to reform the PACER system and make
> data available at no cost, the courts are still reluctant to make
> major changes to the system because of uncertainty about the cost and
> the technical challenges of hosting and distributing the data. The
> RECAP project's effort to mirror a portion of PACER could help answer
> those questions and provide a real-world model that demonstrates the
> viability of open access.

Thanks to everyone for help spreading the word about RECAP. This project
can't succeed without your help.
