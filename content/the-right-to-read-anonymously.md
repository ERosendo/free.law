In 1996, in the Connecticut Law Review, legal scholar Julie Cohen wrote
what has become a landmark article in Internet Law entitled, "[A Right
to Read Anonymously: A Closer Look at "Copyright Management" In
Cyberspace.](http://ssrn.com/abstract=17990)" She began by stating,

> A fundamental assumption underlying our discourse about the activities
> of reading, thinking, and speech is that individuals in our society
> are guaranteed the freedom to form their thoughts and opinions in
> privacy, free from intrusive oversight by governmental or private
> entities.

Cohen notes that, in the past, our right to read anonymously has been
protected by
[libraries](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/library-suspends-tor-node-after-dhs-intimidation)
and [librarians](https://libraryfreedomproject.org/torexits/). See, for
example, the American Library Association's [Freedom to
Read](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/statementspols/freedomreadstatement)
statement, adopted in 1953. Our American experience has generally been
that one is able to walk into a public library, take almost any book off
the shelf, sit down, and read without ever identifying oneself or asking
anyone's permission. Most libraries, as vigorous defenders of reader
privacy, only maintain information about which books you check out until
you return them and then they destroy any record connecting your
identity to the books checked out. It was, in 1996, the growing
prevalence of electronic dissemination of information and technologies
to monitor our receipt of such information that prompted Cohen's article
and its special focus on those monitoring technologies.

Cohen explains the case law that has supported the right to read
anonymously, typically predicated on "the likely chilling effect that
exposure of a reader's tastes would have on expressive conduct, broadly
understood -- not only speech itself, but also the
information-gathering activities that precede speech." In *[Stanley v.
Georgia](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107898/stanley-v-georgia/)*,
394 U.S. 557 (1969), the Supreme Court recognized "the right to
satisfy [one's] intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of
[one's] own home" and "the right to be free from state inquiry into
the contents of [one's] library." Cohen also explains how the Supreme
Court's jurisprudence on [the right to speak
anonymously](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/117921/mcintyre-v-ohio-elections-commn/)
and on [associational
anonymity](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/105746/naacp-v-alabama-ex-rel-patterson/),
each more traditionally understood as protections provided by the First
Amendment, also support the right to read anonymously. I believe her
analysis is absolutely correct and that the First Amendment rights to
speak and to associate are intertwined with this right to read
anonymously such that we should see the right to read anonymously as a
fundamental constitutional right.

Now, imagine a different sort of "library," so different from traditional
libraries we should instead call it simply a "repository." This
repository has no shelves or books directly accessible to the public.
Instead it has only a giant counter, guarded by something so unlike
librarians, we must call them "sentinels." One must request every
document one wishes to read from these robotic sentinels who will make
fastidious notes about your every request. These records of your reading
habits are maintained for at least three months and maybe longer. No one
knows for sure.

Imagine further that before a sentinel will grant any of your document
requests, one must provide the sentinel with one's full name, date of
birth, full address, phone number, email address, and a credit card. The
credit card is necessary, because every request you make of a sentinel
incurs a charge, and most every document you are granted permission to
view also costs money.

Now imagine further that this Orwellian repository is run by the
government and that the documents it keeps under such close watch are
all public domain court records. These documents are the very law
itself. One's First Amendment right to read anonymously is thwarted by
such a system, and this is precisely the system our own government
operates right now under the name "PACER." PACER requires the above
identifying information in order to establish an account and gain access
and PACER's quarterly billing statements contain this detailed record of
every document you read on PACER. The [privacy
policy](https://www.pacer.gov/privacy.html) at PACER.gov gives no
indication how long these records of your reading habits are kept by the
government. On this Constitution Day, I submit, that for this reason
alone---ignoring many others---that the PACER system is unconstitutional
and must be changed.
