Later this week, we are launching a new project to download all of the free opinions and orders that are available on PACER. Since we don't want to unduly impact PACER, we will do this process slowly, giving it several weeks or months to complete, and slowing down as PACER administrators [get in touch][c] with issues. We expect to download millions of PDFs, all of which we will add to the [RECAP Archive][recap] and to the [Internet Archive][ia]. In the RECAP Archive, we will be immediately parsing the contents of all the PDFs as we download them. Once that is complete we will begin the long process of extracting the content of scanned documents as well, as we have done already for the rest of the collection.

This project will create an ongoing expense for Free Law Project. Hosting this many files is not free. So we want to explain why this is an important project and how we need help. The most important reason that we are undertaking this task is simply because it has not yet been done. There is a monumental value to these opinions and orders. They are the law of the land and yet until now their contents have not been searchable except, perhaps, through expensive tools. 
 
Our [work with Georgia State University][gsu] demonstrates how these documents are critically valuable. In that work, we will be providing opinions and orders so that researchers can study how different courts have interpreted the laws around what makes an employee a contractor. 
 
 and we intend to demonstrate that by downloading them and making them available via our website and APIs. We believe that once it is easily available, there will be incredible demand for these documents.

The second reason for this initiative is the evidence that the Administrative Office of the Courts (AO) does not respect these documents. In 2014 the AO [made a unilateral decision to remove content older than 2010 from five jurisdictions][remove]. We can't allow that to happen again, so we're gathering all of these documents as a way of mitigating that risk.

The final important reason why we are undertaking this expensive initiative is that it should provide a mechanism for getting a sample of all important cases from PACER. Our current collection of PACER content only contains a case when it is requested by a RECAP user. This initiative will open up our collection so that we should have basic information about nearly every case in PACER. If the case resulted in an opinion or order, we will have it, and finally, so too will researchers across the country.

We believe that this initiative will be a very important one as we further expand our collection of PACER content and tools, and we hope that you'll support our work as we expand it into this new area.
