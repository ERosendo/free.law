In our last post, we
[mentioned]({filename}/welcome.md) that we
were already working with other organizations that support judicial
transparency to help us build the public repository that lies at RECAP's
foundation. Public.resource.org, led by Carl Malamud, has been
especially helpful in this regard. They have a [vast
repository](http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/pacer/) of court
documents, weighing in at more than 500 gigabytes in total. Over the
last few weeks we've been pre-stocking the archive with these documents,
and we recently crossed the million document threshold.

What this means is that installing RECAP will not only help you
contribute to government transparency, but it's likely to start saving
you money right out of the gate. For example, if you practice law in New
York City, you'll be happy to know that we have 238,098 documents from
the Southern District of New York. If you have RECAP installed, you can
use PACER the way you normally do, and RECAP will automatically inform
you if the document you need is already available for free.

Here is a table of the other courts where we have a significant number
of documents:

  Court                                                                                       No. of Documents
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------
  [District of Alaska](https://ecf.akd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl)                     52,797
  [Northern District of California](https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl)       190,470
  [District of the District of Columbia](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl)   219,049
  [District of Delaware](https://ecf.ded.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl)                   182,900
  [Central District of Illinois](https://ecf.ilcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl)          21,378
  [District of Massachusetts](https://ecf.mad.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl)              217,315
  [Southern District of New York](https://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl)         238,098
  [Eastern District of Pennsylvania](https://ecf.paed.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl)      20,530

We anticipate importing about a million more documents from
Public.resource.org in the coming weeks. The good folks at
[Justia](http://www.justia.com/) have also expressed interest in
contributing to the repository.

Unfortunately, even after we import all the documents from these
organizations, we will still be several million documents short of our
goal of a comprehensive, free repository of court records. That's where
you come in. By [installing the RECAP public
beta](/recap/), you can make an important
contribution to the goal of free public access for all.
