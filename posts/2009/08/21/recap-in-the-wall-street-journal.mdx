Last week we did a
[round-up](/2009/08/14/the-blogosphere-weighs-in-on-recap/)
of leading technology-focused sites that have covered RECAP. Now, it
seems that news of RECAP is spreading beyond the "tech blogosphere," as
more mainstream publications have begun writing about our software.
*Foreign Policy*'s Evgeny Morozov

RECAP, calling it "smart and subversive." On Wednesday *NextGov*, a
*National Journal* publication widely read within the government IT
community, ran a [thorough write-up of
RECAP](http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20090819_1886.php?oref=topnews)
by Aliya Sternstein. It included some good background on how RECAP fits
into the larger debate about judicial transparency.

Finally, Katherine Mangu-Ward has [penned a piece for the *Wall Street
Journal*](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203550604574361032197709414.html)
about RECAP. Katherine calls RECAP "a sleek little add-on" with "a
stylish and subversive touch." She writes:

> With the possible exception of the ever-leaky CIA, no aspect of
> government remains more locked down than the secretive, hierarchical
> judicial branch. Digital records of court filings, briefs and
> transcripts sit behind paywalls like Lexis and Westlaw. Legal codes
> and judicial documents aren't copyrighted, but governments often cut
> exclusive distribution deals, rendering other access methods a bit
> legally questionable. Supreme Court decisions are easy to get, but the
> briefs and decisions of lower courts can be hard to come by.

> Last week, a team from Princeton's Center for Information Technology

> filch protected judicial records and make them available for free
> online. One of the developers, Harvard's Stephen Schultze, says he
> went digging for some First Amendment precedent last fall and was
> shocked by the outdated technology he found. Knowing that "there's a
> certain geek cache to openness projects these days," Mr. Schultze and
> Princeton computer science grad students Tim Lee and Harlan Yu went
> straight to work.
