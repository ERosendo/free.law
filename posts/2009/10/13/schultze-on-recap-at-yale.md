Last week RECAP's Steve Schultze and Harlan Yu visited Yale Law School
to give a [talk](http://yaleisp.org/?p=363) sponsored by Yale's
Information Society Project. Yale librarian Jason Eiseman produced a
[short interview with Steve](http://www.jasoneiseman.com/blog/?p=332)
that he describes as "a little [Blair
Witch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blair_Witch_Project)." Steve
talks about the origins of RECAP, discusses some of the current
challenge faced by RECAP, and talks briefly about RECAP's newest sister
project, [FedThread.](http://fedthread.org/)
