After many months of works and about 100 revisions to the code, today
we've rolled out the latest version of the site. This version comes with
some great enhancements:

-   We rolled this out to our Twitter stream a few months ago, but we
    finally have proper branding and a proper logo. We're still keeping
    things simple, but this should make things a little prettier.
-   We've added the search box to all pages so searches are easier to
    make and so you can see what search brought you to the document
    you're looking at.
-   A new favorites feature has been added that allows you to make notes
    about cases that interest you, and to see all of your notes in your
    profile.
-   The sidebar has been moved to the left in preparation for faceted
    searching and browsing
-   Lots of code clean up, lots of aesthetic fixes and dozens of small
    fixes here, there and everywhere.

We're really happy with this refresh and the new features that are
coming along with it. If you notice anything that's not working properly
or that could be better, we're always happy to hear your feedback.
