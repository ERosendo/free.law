As mentioned in a previous post, we are currently making some changes to
our back end to allow better citation meta data and searching
granularity. As part of these changes, we have made two small changes to
our dump formats.

The first change is to list docketNumber, westCite and lexisCite instead
of caseNumber and westCitation. We previously had many West-style
citations listed as generic case numbers. This wasn't very accurate, so
we've re-organized this to have better granularity.

The second change we've made is to how we handle missing or incomplete
data. Previously, if a case was missing data, we would simply not
include it in a dump. This was not the best solution, so we're now
including any information we have about a case in every dump we create.
In some cases, this can create partial cases that lack vital meta data.

We hope these changes will be easy to work with, and that they'll cause
no disruption.
