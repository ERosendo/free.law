Last week, [our community lost Aaron
Swartz](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/sjs/grieving-aaron-swartz/).
We are still reeling. Aaron was a fighter for openness and freedom, and
many people have been channeling their grief into positive actions for
causes that were close to Aaron's heart. One of these people is [Aaron
Greenspan](http://www.aarongreenspan.com/about/index.html), creator of
the open-data site [Plainsite](http://www.plainsite.org/) and the [Think
Computer Foundation](http://www.thinkcomputer.org/). He has established
a generous set of grants to be awarded to the first person (or group)
that develops the following upgrades to
[RECAP](/recap/), our court record liberation
system. [RECAP would not
exist](http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2011/02/03/pacer-recap-and-the-movement-to-free-american-case-law/)
without the work of Aaron Swartz.

> Three grants are being made available related to RECAP. Each grant is
> worth $5,000.00:
>
> 1.  **Grant 1**: Develop and release a version of RECAP for the Google
>     Chrome browser that matches the current Firefox browser extension
>     functionality
> 2.  **Grant 2**: Develop and release a version of RECAP for Internet
>     Explorer that matches the current Firefox browser extension
>     functionality
> 3.  **Grant 3**: Update the Firefox browser extension to capture
>     appellate court documents, and update the RECAP server code to
>     parse them and respond appropriately to browser extension requests


For more details, see [The Aaron Swartz Memorial
Grants](http://www.plainsite.org/aaronsw/index.html). If you are

We are honored to be part of one of the many projects being undertaken
in Aaron Swartz's honor.
