We're on a roll, and today I'm happy to share that we've added yet
another court to the site. Today's court, with about 50 cases so far, is
the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Ninth Circuit.

We'll be adding a historical scraper for this court soon, but for now,
sit back and enjoy our super-fast results as they get delivered straight
to your email.

50 today. 1,000 tomorrow.
