Today, teams across the country are hard at work on the [Aaron Swartz
Memorial
Grants](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/sjs/announcing-the-aaron-swartz-memorial-grants/).
These grants, offered by the Think Computer Foundation, provide $5,000
awards for three different projects related to RECAP.

We are delighted to announce additional awards. The [generous
folks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_DiBona) over at Google's Open
Source Programs team have pledged to support two more RECAP-related
project awards -- at $5,000 each. These are open to anyone who wishes
to submit a proposal for a significant improvement to the RECAP system.
We will work with the proposers to scope the project and define what
qualifies for the award. All projects must be open source.

There are several potential ideas. For instance, someone might propose
add support to RECAP for displaying the user's current balance and
prompting the user to liberate up to their free quarterly $15
allocation as the end of the quarter approaches (inspired by [Operation
Asymptote](http://www.plainsite.org/asymptote/index.html)). Someone
might propose to improve the
[https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/) interface, and
to improve detection and removal of private information. Someone might
propose some other idea that we haven't thought of. You may wish to
[watch the discussion of a few of these initial
ideas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EetPNWtzvo&feature=youtu.be&t=1h10m10s)
from our developer kickoff session.
