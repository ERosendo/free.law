<p className="bg-danger alert"><strong>Update</strong>: This tool has been deprecated. We heartily recommend <a href="/2016/03/01/vagrant/">our new process using Vagrant</a>.</p>

A goal of the Free Law Project is to make development of legal tools as
easy as possible. In that vein, we're excited to share that as of today
we're officially taking the wraps off what we're calling the [Free Law
Virtual Machine](https://www.courtlistener.com/tools/free-law-machine/).

For those not familiar with this, a virtual machine is a snapshot of a
computer that can be run by anybody, anywhere. With this release, we've
created a computer running Ubuntu Linux that our developers or academics
can download, and which has all of the Free Law Project's efforts
pre-loaded and ready to go.

In addition to a number of minor improvements, the following are
installed and configured:

-   Courtlistener
-   Juriscraper
-   Development tools such as Intellij, Meld, vim, and Kiki
-   Bookmarks of all American courts

In addition to providing a simple virtual machine that you can install,
we're also releasing [sample
data](https://www.courtlistener.com/tools/sample-data/) that can easily
be imported into the [CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com)
platform. This data is available in groups of 50, 500, 5,000 or 50,000
records so that anybody can easily begin working or experimenting with
our platform.

If you're interested in using the Free Law Virtual Machine, feel free to
download and use it, and please get [in touch to share your work][c].
