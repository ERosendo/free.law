While prepping to import the Lawbox corpus, one of the many things we
did was redesign our jurisdiction picker so it would support more than
350 jurisdictions. Completing this efort was a collaboration between me
and a volunteer contributor, [Peter
Nguyen](http://www.petertnguyen.com/). Peter and I worked together
iteratively, first building a wireframe of the jurisdiction picker, then
a prototype, then the final version that you see today.

Before beginning, we outlined the use cases that the new picker should
support. It should:

-   Allow a user to select a single jurisdiction;
-   Allow a user to select all jurisdictions from state, federal,
    district, bankruptcy or all of the above;
-   Allow a user to select in hybrid mode -- expanding a selection of a
    state courts to the related federal courts or vice versa;
-   Allow users to easily select the courts they desire by filtering to
    the ones they're interested in;
-   Support more than 300 jurisdictions without taking up too much
    space; and
-   Be responsive and fast.

In our version we released yesterday, we accomplished most of these
goals. Using the links at the top of the picker, it's easy to select or
clear an entire tab, a collection of tabs, or all tabs. Using the
filter, it's easy to select by typing, allowing our users to select the
courts they want without skimming long lists. By typing just a few
letters and pressing enter, you can make sophisiticated jurisdiction
selections.

There are still a few features we'd like to add to the picker, and you
can watch for them soon. One is the hybrid selection mode, and the other
is synonym support, so that typing words like "Eastern" will return
courts in the "E." district.

On the backend, we ran into a couple challenges while building the new
picker. First, Internet Explorer 8 and below only [support about 2000
characters in a
URL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers).
This causes lots of problems across the Web, but for us it meant that
users selecting lots of jurisdictions would run into problems. The id
codes we use for the jurisdictions are about four letters long, each,
and our URLs used to look like

> &court\_id=ca2&court\_id=ca3&court\_id=...

For every jurisdiction selected, it would send *&court\_id=* along for
the ride, making the URLs very long. Our new version tweaks this so that
all the court identifiers are simply separated by a comma and sent in a
single block. Much better, and of course the old URLs still work so long
as they're short enough.

As we built the new court picker, we had several iterations. The first
was a basic wireframe like so:

![Modal
Example](/images/mockup-screenshot.png)

This didn't work at all, but it provided a pretty good place to start.
Around the same time, Peter was experimenting with the [Chosen jQuery
plugin](http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/), and built [a
prototype](http://notskool.me/courtlistener/filter_demo_added.htm) that
greatly enhanced our sidebar without forcing people to use modal
dialogs:

![chooser
example](/images/chooser.png)](http://notskool.me/courtlistener/header-chooser.htm)

Not bad, but it made it very difficult to select lots of jurisdictions,
which was a problem. We did another iteration of the modal dialog, and
ended up with [a working
demo](http://notskool.me/courtlistener/header-chooser.htm) that looks
like this:

![filter
demo](/images/filter-demo1.png)

Our final version is quite similar, but is changed in a couple
significant ways. It has "Clear" and "Select All" links at the top, and
it changes the filter so that it checks boxes as you type rather than
hiding them out of view. The final version is now [live on the
site](https://courtlistener.com), and should provide a great foundation
as we move forward. We're already investigating more jurisdictions, and
we expect it won't be too hard next time.
