Last week legal publisher Fastcase included Free Law Project
co-founders, Brian Carver and Michael Lissner on the company's[annual
list of "Fastcase 50" award
recipients](http://www.fastcase.com/fastcase50-winners-2014). As their
[press
release](http://www.fastcase.com/fastcase-announces-2014-%e2%80%9cfastcase-50%e2%80%9d-award-winners/)
explains, "The Fastcase 50 award recognizes 50 of the smartest, most
courageous innovators, techies, visionaries, and leaders in the law."

Michael and I are humbled by and grateful for this recognition. We're
especially thrilled to see individuals we have worked with included on
this year's list, such as:

-   [Frank Bennett](https://twitter.com/fgbjr), who created the [Free
    Law
    Ferret](http://citationstylist.org/2013/08/20/free-law-ferret-document-to-cited-cases-in-a-click/),
    adapting some of CourtListener's citation-finding code to JavaScript
    and enabling users of the extension to find citations on any website
    and then get the documents from CourtListener.
-   [Jake Heller](https://twitter.com/casetext), CEO of
    [CaseText](http://casetext.com), whose team there has frequently
    been a helpful sounding board when Mike and I are thinking through
    the interesting questions that arise when trying to put useful legal
    research tools on the web.
-   [Colin Starger](https://twitter.com/colinstarger), of the University
    of Baltimore School of Law, with whom we've had great conversations
    about citations, metadata, and bulk downloads, not topics of
    conversation that everyone has as much experience with as Colin!
-   [David Zvenyach](https://twitter.com/vdavez), General Counsel to the
    Council of the District of Columbia, who saw that we hadn't gotten
    around to adding scrapers for the D.C. Court of Appeals or the
    District Court for the District of Columbia to
    [juriscraper](https://github.com/freelawproject/juriscraper) and wrote
    them for us.

These individuals were obviously recognized for their broader work, but
we were excited to see those with whom we've already made a connection
getting much-deserved recognition. Especially since we all join a
distinguished group of past winners, many of whom we've also received
advice or assistance from, including: 2013 awardees Bob Berring, Josh
Blackman, Sara Frug, Tim Hwang, Dan Katz, Dan Lewis, Eric Mill, Josh
Tauberer, and 2012 awardees Jerry Goldman, Waldo Jaquith, Peter Martin,
Elmer Masters, and 2011 awardees Monica Bay, Tom Bruce, Sarah
Glassmeyer, John Joergensen, Carl Malamud, Rob Richards, and Tim
Stanley. At various times we've been inspired by, gotten advice from, or
gotten help from all these folks, among others, so we think they deserve
some credit for any headway we've made on the problems we're tackling,
while we're happy to take all the blame for any missteps or not making
more progress faster.

The only problem with these lists is that Fastcase CEO, Ed Walters,
should be on there too. Thanks, Ed!
