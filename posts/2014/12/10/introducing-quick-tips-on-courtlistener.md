Starting today, as you use CourtListener you'll see Quick Tips on the
bottom of search results. They show up below search pagination and look
something like this:

The idea behind this feature is to give people quick bits of information
about Free Law Project, CourtListener, RECAP and any other projects that
we create in the future. As of now we've seeded the tips with about 20
that we thought would be useful, but because all of our work is in the
open, we're welcoming our users to add tips that they think would be
useful.

To add a tip you'll need a Github account and some basic HTML skills. If
you have these two things, you can [wander over to the list of
tips](https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener/blob/master/alert/lib/context_processors.py#L11 "Tips on Github")
and submit some of your own. If they're good, we'll add them to the
site!
