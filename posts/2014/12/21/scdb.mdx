Earlier this week [somebody on the
Internet](https://github.com/ariddell "https://xkcd.com/386/") pinged us
with [some
code](https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener/issues/319) and
asked that we integrate the data from the [Supreme Court Database
(SCDB)](http://scdb.wustl.edu/about.php). Well, we're happy to share
that less than a week later we've taken the code they provided and used
it to upgrade CourtListener's database.

The Supreme Court Database includes data for about 8,500 Supreme Court
opinions from 1946 to 2013 and this first pass merges that data with
CourtListener so that:

-   Our copy of these opinions are enhanced with better parallel
    citations. You can now look these items up by U.S. Reporter (U.S.),
    The Supreme Court Reporter (S.Ct.), Lawyers' Edition (L.Ed.) or even
    LEXIS citation (U.S. LEXIS). This should make our citation graph
    much more robust and should help people like [Colin Starger at
    University of
    Baltimore](http://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/profiles/starger.cfm) that
    are doing [great analyses with this
    data](http://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/scotus-mapping/index.cfm). Many
    of these items were screen scraped directly from the Supreme Court
    website meaning that for these items, this is the first time they
    have had proper citations. Here's an example of the many parallel
    citations items now have:

-   All Supreme Court Opinions from 1946 to 2013 have a new field that
    can be used by researchers to join them with the SCDB. This will
    allow the opinions from CourtListener to be merged with the items in
    SCDB to get any fields that we did not yet import ([SCDB has dozens
    of fields](http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php)!)

So, this first pass at a merge of SCDB and CourtListener accomplishes
the immediate goals of adding more citations and of making it possible
to join the two databases, but we have not yet imported all of the many
fields that are included in the SCDB. We're waiting to hear from the
community before moving forward with any of the other fields so that we
can learn which are valuable to our users. Depending on which fields
people ask for, it should be easy for us to add them as needed. Be in
touch and we'll be happy to import further data.

Like many of our recent features, this enhancement was possible because
somebody wanted our data enhanced, gave us a great prototype
implementation, and asked for us to do the last little bit to deploy it
on CourtListener. We're happy to do so today and to release the best
CourtListener data yet.
