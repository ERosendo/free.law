<p className="bg-danger alert"><strong>Update</strong>: This initiative has ended.</p>

In [Chief Justice Roberts' End of Year
Report](http://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/2014year-endreport.pdf)
there were some astounding figures about the size and scope of PACER,
the Federal system for court filings. Among his figures was the fact
that there are more than "one billion retrievable documents" in PACER:

<blockquote className="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PACER has 1B docs. Averaging 6 pages, that&#39;d cost $600M to download. Biggest paywall ever. <a href="http://t.co/Vn0YEAQx1k">http://t.co/Vn0YEAQx1k</a> <a href="http://t.co/pknozoHldq">pic.twitter.com/pknozoHldq</a></p>&mdash; â„³ike Lissner (@mlissner) <a href="https://twitter.com/mlissner/status/555858284091944960">January 15, 2015</a></blockquote>

We believe that this means that PACER is the largest collection of
public domain documents locked behind a pay wall. Having access to this
information is vital to a functioning judiciary and we are working to
break it open.

[Public.Resource.org](https://public.resource.org/) recently [published
an excellent memo](http://yo.yourhonor.org/) outlining a campaign to
retrieve from PACER more of its contents and to create pressure for it
to be opened completely. The memo, which is worth a read in itself,
defines a strategy of "litigation, supplication, and agitation."

Today we're announcing a plan that should help with the third part of
the strategy: Agitation.

Here's how it will work:

1.  Today, you sign up for our email list.
2.  PACER provides [a fee waiver for the first
    $15](https://www.pacer.gov/psc/faq.html#H_PGP3) that you spend each
    quarter. Near the end of each quarter, we will send you an email
    reminding you to download $15-worth of content from PACER, if you
    haven't done so already.
3.  You install the RECAP extension and then use [Think Computer
    Foundation's Operation
    Asymptote](http://www.plainsite.org/asymptote/) to identify
    documents that are not already part of our free public archive.
4.  You download suggested items until you get close to the $15 fee
    waiver, then you STOP.

Our hope is that [the administrators of
PACER](http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/UnderstandingtheFederalCourts/AdministrativeOffice.aspx)
will notice an unusual usage of the quarterly fee waiver and that they
will begin to feel pressure to open up the system. At the same time,
since we are using the [RECAP extension](/recap/),
we will be contributing all of this content to the public domain.

The more people we can get on board this project, the greater our impact
will be.

In preparation for this plan of agitation there are four pieces of
homework:

1.  [Create a PACER account if you do not have one
    yet](https://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/pscof/registration.jsf).
2.  Install the RECAP extension for
    [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recap/oiillickanjlaeghobeeknbddaonmjnc)
    and/or
    [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/201452/recap-0.9.1-fx.xpi).
3.  [Sign up for the email
    list](http://lists.freelawproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/recap-reminder)
    so we can remind you when the time is right.
4.  Tell a friend!

Beyond a demonstration that many people care about these documents being
free, we hope these efforts will actually make a substantial number of
new documents freely available to the public.

Sign up today and let's start agitating.
