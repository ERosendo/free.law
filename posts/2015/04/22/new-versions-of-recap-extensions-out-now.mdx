We've
released new versions of the RECAP extensions for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recap/oiillickanjlaeghobeeknbddaonmjnc?hl=en)
and
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/recap-195534/)
and they will be auto-updating in your browsers soon.

These are the first new versions in more than two years, and while they
are relatively small releases, we're very excited to be rolling them
out.

The headline feature for these extensions is a new Team Name field that
you can configure in your settings. We are planning some competitions to
see who can upload the most documents to RECAP and to participate,
you'll have to join a team and fill in this field with the team's name.
For now, this is a beta feature, so take a look and let us know if you
have ideas for improving or using it.

There are a handful of other fixes that have also landed in these
releases. In both Chrome and Firefox, the icons have been improved to
support high resolution screens, and the extensions have been changed to
support HTTPS uploads, making them more private and secure. In Chrome,
we have a new testing framework, thanks to a volunteer developer, and we
have fixed notifications to work more reliably.

A lot of this is minor work that is long overdue, but it's laying the
foundation for the next generation of RECAP. These updates don't fix all
the outstanding issues, but we're working on it and have also created a
[central place for users to report
issues](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap).

So what now? Well, the next versions of RECAP are already under way, and
we hope to bring them out soon. If you're interested in getting
involved, get in touch! There's a lot to do!
