Passing along this call for papers:

> **Special Issue of Artificial Intelligence and Law in Honor of
> Carole Hafner: call for papers**
>
> Earlier this year, Carole Hafner, a key figure in the origin and
> development of AI and Law, died. A tribute to Carole can be found
> at <http://www.iaail.org/?q=page/memorials>. A special issue
> of Artificial Intelligence and Law (which she co-founded) will be
> published in 2016, focusing on Carole's main research topics:
> semantic retrieval and the procedural, temporal and teleological
> aspects of reasoning with legal cases.
>
> In her long academic career, Carole Hafner made contributions in a
> number of areas of AI and Law. Her 1978 Ph.D. dissertation was a
> pioneering effort in semantic information retrieval of legal cases;
> ahead of its time, it supplied what would now be called ontologies for
> describing case law domains and cases, a retrieval language, and
> methods for retrieving, from a corpus of a hundred cases, cases
> providing: examples of which a specified concept is (or is not) true,
> criteria for knowing that the concept does (or does not) hold, or the
> consequences of the presence or absence of the concept in a particular
> case. Today, developments in technology have transformed the
> possibilities for information and case retrieval, and opened up rich
> possibilities to address the issues which motivated Carole.
>
> Perhaps her most significant contributions were her triptych of papers
> written with Don Berman published in the 1991, 1993 and 1995 ICAIL
> conferences and consolidated in an AI and Law journal paper (Hafner
> and Berman 2002). All three of these papers dealt with various
> limitations of factor based reasoning. The 1991 paper (Berman and
> Hafner 1991) called for more account to be taken of the procedural
> context. The 1993 paper (Berman and Hafner 1993) discussed the need
> for consideration to be given to the social purposes of laws and legal
> decisions and the 1995 paper (Berman and Hafner 1995) recognized the
> dynamic nature of case law, and suggested that it was essential to be
> aware of the possibility that a current consensus was breaking down
> and a landmark case was coming. Factor based reasoning remains a very
> popular way of looking at reasoning with cases in AI and Law, and
> these papers are as relevant today as they were when they were first
> written. Although it is the second of these papers which has received
> by far the most attention of the three, all of them discuss issues
> that still demand attention.
>
> We therefore invite contributions to a special issue of Artificial
> Intelligence and Law intended to revisit these aspects of conceptual
> case information retrieval or of reasoning with legal cases and the
> contribution of these papers. While contributions on any or all of the
> papers are welcome, we particularly seek contributions on the
> procedural and temporal aspects of case based reasoning, which we
> regard as unduly neglected. All contributions should clearly
> demonstrate their connection with Carole's work. The editor of the
> special issue will be Trevor Bench-Capon, and all papers will go
> through the standard review process for this journal.
>
> Contributions, which should be submitted through the Journal's site
> at <http://www.editorialmanager.com/arti/default.aspx> and copied to
> Trevor Bench-Capon (tbc@csc.liv.ac.uk), should be received by
> 31st May 2016, and notification of acceptance will be by the end of
> July 2016 with a view to the special issue appearing as the last issue
> of 2016.
