We've talked many times in the past
about [how difficult PACER is to use][pacer-vid] and
about [what you can do to help fix PACER][todo]. As we gear up for our new
PACER Clearinghouse, we're writing a few more posts about PACER so that people
can wrap their minds around just how bad it is. Today, I want to talk briefly
about how the PACER search interface contradicts with well-known information
retrieval best practices.

Before we can delve into information retrieval best practices, we need to look
for a moment at the purpose of PACER, as described by Congress in the
e-Government act of 2002.
