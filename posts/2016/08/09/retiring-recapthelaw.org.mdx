We're talking a lot about RECAP lately and we've realized that it's a good time to retire the recapthelaw.org website. Free Law Project took over RECAP back in May of 2014 and since then there have been two places where we wrote blog posts, two places where you could get information about PACER and RECAP, and two places we had to maintain on a day to day basis. By winding down this site, we'll be able to focus more clearly on the task at hand -- liberating documents from PACER.
  
As of now, all the old content has been moved to this site, and the new home for RECAP is [https://free.law/recap/][1]. You can go check it out --- we spent some time on it, and it should be a great homepage for the project.

If you have any thoughts or notice anything broken please let us know. We'll have more announcements about RECAP soon.
