We're proud to share that we've now linked together our [database of judges][jdb] and our [database of oral argument recordings][oa]. This means that as of now if you look at the profile page for a judge, you may see a list of oral argument recordings for cases that judge heard.

For example, on the page for [Ruth Bader Ginsburg][rbg], there is a new section that looks like this:

<div className="left-image">
    <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/person/1213/ruth-bader-ginsburg">
        <img src="/images/rbg-oa.png"
             alt="Example screenshot of RBG"
             className="img-responsive border"/>
    </a>
    <p className="caption">Ginsburg has participated in hundreds of oral arguments that we have in our system.</p> 
</div>
<div className="clearfix"></div>

Clicking on the button at the bottom takes you back to our [database of oral argument recordings][oa] where you can further refine your search. If the judge is active, there is an icon in the upper right that lets you subscribe to a podcast of the cases heard by that judge. At this time, these features are only available for the Supreme Court and for jurisdictions where the judges for specific cases are provided by the court website. We hope to expand this in the future.

To our knowledge, a linkage like this has never previously existed on any system, and we hope that it will make research and exploration faster and easier for our users. To get started with this addition, you can browse [the judges in CourtListener][j], or explore our [APIs and Bulk Data][api], where files now include this information.
