Today, we're celebrating another milestone. We now have more than a million minutes of oral argument audio in [CourtListener.com's oral argument archive][archive]. All of this audio is available in our search engine, APIs, podcasts, and our website.

A million minutes of oral argument audio is a lot, so it helps to contextualize it. This is nearly 700 days of continuous oral argument audio from nearly thirty thousand cases. Put another way, listening to this entire collection [would take as long as watching every episode of *The Simpsons* 76 times][binge].

We have had a lot of success with our oral argument archive, and we're thrilled to be able to provide it at no cost, despite its size growing every day. 

In the coming months we will continue expanding this collection in two key ways. First, we plan to begin automatically generating transcripts for audio files so that you can get an email alert any time certain words are said in court. Second, we plan to continue expanding our coverage so that it includes more state courts, and so that it includes all of the federal courts that have recordings available.
 
Between these two initiatives, we will continue expanding our archive and making it better. Soon we'll be archiving more than ever.
