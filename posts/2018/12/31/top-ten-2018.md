This year we hosted legal documents from the most important cases in the country. Many of these documents are of historical significance, like the sentencing memos for Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security Advisor, and Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer. Others are less important, but still popular, like the SEC taking Elon Musk to task for making materially false statements about Tesla. 

Whatever the case though, without exception, the top ten downloaded documents have to do, in one form or another, with either Tesla or Trump.
