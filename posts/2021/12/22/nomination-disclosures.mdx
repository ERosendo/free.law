<p class="lead">Financial Disclosure Database Now Spans 34 Years</p>


Our financial disclosure database now includes disclosures spanning 34 years (1987-2020). We found judicial
 nomination financial disclosures of 874 judges stretching back to the Reagan Administration in 1987.

## Why it matters

We began collecting financial disclosures in an effort to preserve them from being thrown away in 2017.
Unfortunately, the laws around financial disclosures only make them available for six (6) years.

         className="img-responsive"/>
</div>

Even with that limitation in place our work on financial disclosures culminated in a first-of-its-kind database with
over a million investment transactions, and roughly 250,000 pages of disclosures. This database was used
 by the WSJ to engage in ground breaking investigations into ethics violations of the judiciary. Despite our best
  efforts that database did not include any disclosures prior to 2003.

Today we add disclosures for 874 judicial nominees and expands our database further. This expansion includes nearly
every nominee to the federal bench since the end of the Reagan Administration. We hope this expansion helps provide
researchers, journalists and attorneys greater insight into the federal judiciary.

## How we did it

We knew that judicial nominees filed financial disclosures with the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the nomination
 process. So we began researching Senate hearing records earlier this year.

This lead us to discover that nomination disclosures are in fact available in
 the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/chrg/115/senate/Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Congressional Archives</a>.
 These disclosures are combined with with the resumes, questionnaires, litigation histories and letters of
 recommendation for judicial nominees. Unfortunately these disclosures were included with roughly 250,000 pages of
  Senate records.

Normally sifting through such a high volume of data by hand would be too much for a small organization like ours.

But Free Law Project is as unique as it is creative. As experts in data processing and documents
we built and <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/nomination-extractor"> trained a machine learning model</a> to
identify financial disclosures based on how they look as images.  The model once trained can
identify a page in the Senate records as a financial disclosure based on the unique design of the disclosure form.
In fact, it can identify the what page of the form we are looking at with a high degree of accuarcy.

We took our model and applied it to our collection of Senate records and extracted out the nomination disclosures. The
model was even able to accurately identify disclosures that were handwritten, typed on typewriters or printed
from a computer.

You can learn more about how we built and used the machine learning with
our <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/nomination-extractor"> Nomination Extactor</a>

In total we found 874 financial disclosures, and with the help of dedicated volunteers, we were able to identify and
add these disclosures to our database. Beginning today you can find these disclosures alongside the annual financial
disclosures in our <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/financial-disclosures/">Financial Disclosures</a> database.

## Of Note

- Our expansion includes disclosures for 30 judges in which we had no prior financial disclosure.

- Many nomination disclosures from the 1980 and 1990s are handwritten.  They have been added to our database but have not been extracted. This means that the
   data is not searchable in our API.

- Financial disclosures for failed judicial nominees are not included in our database.

- Some judges filed executive branch financial disclosures. These are included in our database.

- Our <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/nomination-extractor">Nomination Extactor</a> tool is available to
   everyone. If you have a similar project and need to extract a needle in a haystack, please let us know.
   We hope our tool can help you.

## A Thank You
