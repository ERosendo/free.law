<p class="lead">The mission of Free Law Project is to use data and advocacy to make the legal system more innovative and equitable. Today we are announcing the next step in this journey as we share the news that we will be officially hosting the opinions of the Supreme Court of Maine and the Tennessee Workers' Compensation Courts.
</p>

Already, we have launched [a portal for the Tennessee Workers' Compensation courts][tenn], where they upload their opinions and the public can easily search them. Over the coming weeks, we will also be launching a new portal for the Supreme Court of Maine.

These portals may not look like much, but they represent something new in the legal field. As courts upload their decisions into these portals, the data becomes both full text searchable on our website and freely available via our [APIs and bulk data system][apis]. In addition, we apply all of our innovative tools to the text of the opinions: Citations [become links][eyecite], [opinions get summarized][parens], and more.

This suite of services makes the data available to anybody that needs it, whether it's a pro se litigant doing research, a big law firm, or the next legal startup.


## Be our next partner

We know that nothing is simple in the judiciary, but we have worked hard to make this system low-friction and easy to join. Depending on your availability and decision-making process, we can launch a portal in a matter of days.

If you believe your court or your constituents would benefit from this system, or if you want to participate in building a more open, competitive, accessible, and equitable judiciary, [get in touch][c].

We'd love to have you as our next partner.
