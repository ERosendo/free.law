<p class="lead">For over a decade, the <a href="/recap/">RECAP Extensions</a> have liberated documents from the PACER system. One by one, our users have sent us millions of documents, which we have built into one of the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/">largest open databases of federal court filings in the country</a>.</p>

While this system works well, sometimes it didn't feel like *enough*. Lawyers and litigants get notification emails from PACER that contain links to download PACER documents for free. Why weren't we getting those documents too?

Well, today we take the first step in changing that.

Starting today, litigants and lawyers that receive PACER notification emails can add the following email address to their account:

<AlertBox><p class="text-center text-lg font-bold">archive@recap.email</p></AlertBox>

Once that email is added to your PACER account, we will get the same notifications you do (yours will be unchanged). When we get the notification, we'll download the available PDF and add it to our system. It's that simple. You add it once, we RECAP all your notifications going forward.

This is the first piece of a larger system we have been working on for over a year. We'll have more to say about the rest of it soon.


## How do I start using archive@recap.email?

Getting started is very simple. Just add `archive@recap.email` as a secondary recipient in your PACER account. It takes about a minute:

1. Log into PACER's user management portal here:

    <https://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/pscof/login.xhtml>

2. Select **Maintain Your Email** and then **Add New Email Address**.

3. Enter archive@recap.email as a secondary email address, and make sure that it's set to receive HTML notifications for all your cases.

Done!
