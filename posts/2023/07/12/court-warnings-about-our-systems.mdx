<p class="lead">Over the past decade, legal innovation has surged and society has reaped huge benefits from open legal information.</p>

We exist to facilitate these benefits and innovation, but it can be difficult. The latest challenge came yesterday, when a number of federal courts sent a memo warning that systems like ours could have access to restricted documents.

As we explain below, we respect the concern and the vigilance, and we work very hard to avoid accessing any restricted content.

Specifically, the memo states that:

> Sharing your PACER account credentials with a third-party service provider or designating that provider as a secondary recipient of [email notifications] will give it access to sealed or restricted case information and documents in violation of court order.

This is a strong warning, for an important issue, and it deserves a detailed response. We believe our systems are safe and our ten-year track record should prove it, but below explains our approach to these concerns.


## Why our systems are safe

The court warns against two actions filers may take:

1. "Sharing your PACER account credentials", and

2. "Designating that provider as a secondary recipient of [email notifications]."

To the first concern, it is easy to respond: We simply do not have user credentials. Full stop.

To the second concern, yes, our notification handler, [@recap.email][rde], can be designated as a secondary recipient for notifications from CM/ECF. We created this system to open the legal system for the benefit of society, and it has successfully liberated thousands of documents from behind the PACER paywall.

However, being designated as a secondary recipient does not mean that we get access to restricted documents. Again, in order to have such access, you need a user's filing credentials, which we do not collect.

That should address the concerns explicitly raised by the courts in their memo, but for the past decade we have also hosted the [RECAP extension][r], which may raise additional concerns we're happy to touch on as well.

The RECAP extension automatically uploads publicly accessible documents from PACER as you buy them, liberating them to the public. To prevent this tool from uploading restricted documents, we take three steps. First, we encourage filers to use PACER accounts (not filing accounts) whenever using RECAP. That way, the extension will never have access to restricted content. Second, the extension can detect sealed filings and is designed not to upload them.

Third, accidents do happen. From time to time content is filed publicly in PACER despite the intention of it being sealed. This rarely happens, but when it does, we work diligently to remove such content from our systems as quickly as possible. This is often completed within a few minutes. Finally, after an item is removed, we mark it as sealed in our system, so no further issues are possible.

## Legal Data Should be Free

To wrap up this post, we'll conclude by saying that we wish the court had initiated a dialog with us before sending this memo. We know courts are busy, but our continued inability to work together on issues like this negatively impacts economists, journalists, researchers, litigants, and the public at large, who deserve open legal information. Congress will soon make PACER free. When it does, such issues and how we address them will become more important than ever.

We work hard to identify and keep sealed information secure. If any member of the court or user of our systems has further questions or concerns, we would be pleased at the opportunity to [discuss the issue further][c].
