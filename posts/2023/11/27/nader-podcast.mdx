<p class="lead">Ralph Nader sat down with our Executive Director Michael Lisser and asked him about how free access to court opinions and other legal 
documents can make the American legal system more transparent and easier for people to navigate.</p>

In the 2-part episode **Corporate Bullsh*t/ Legal Bullsh*t** published by the Ralph Nader Radio Hour on November 11, 2023, Ralph welcomes back 
public interest advocate Donald Cohen to discuss the long history of corporate propaganda covering for corporate greed, and his new book Corporate Bullsh*t: 
Exposing the Lies and Half-Truths That Protect Profit, Power, and Wealth in America. Then Ralph is joined by founder of the Free Law Project, 
Michael Lissner, to talk about why the American legal system is so hard to use and the ongoing fight to make it more accessible.
