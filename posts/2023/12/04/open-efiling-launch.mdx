<p className="lead">For over a decade we have lamented the growing trend of eFiling and Case Management systems that make money by selling court records. These proprietary systems put an anti-democratic price tag on legal research and understanding.</p>

This impacts the court itself and all who interact with it by blocking a full understanding of the court. It is particularly harmful to those that cannot afford to pay for court records.

Today, with support from the BiaEcho Foundation, Free Law Project is announcing its plan to disrupt this trend. Free Law Project will spend the next year partnering with courts to design and prototype the first open access and open source eFiling system. We envision a modern system that uses the latest advances to serve the varied needs of courts and the public.

We know this will be a complex task and we don't expect to have a solution in the first year. However, we do think we can make significant progress on this important problem and that it's past time to get started. 

To begin this process, we are hiring a user researcher to study the complexities of this project and detail our findings. Please review [our job posting][h] and share this important project with your peers so that we can get the best possible applicants.

We are also looking for courts to partner with on this important project. To be a part of the pilot program please contact our Director of Philanthropy, Jenifer Whiston at jenifer@free.law.
