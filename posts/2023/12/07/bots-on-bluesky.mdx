<p className="lead">Earlier this year, we created <a href="https://bots.law">Bots.law</a> to bring legal updates to a variety of platforms. Since then, we've created <a href="/2023/10/10/little-cases-launched">ten different bots</a> on Twitter and Mastodon that share updates about everything from artificial intelligence to psychedelic substances. We <a href="https://bots.law/collaboration/">plan to add</a> Slack, MS Teams, and Discord support soon.</p>

We do this work to keep people updated about changes in the law, but it is hard work as Twitter/X [slowly falls to pieces][masnick].

To combat this, today we are launching all of our bots on [BlueSky][bs]. 

BlueSky is a new open and decentralized social network, and adding our bots to it will allow more of our users to stay current on important changes to the law and society.

The bots we're launching on BlueSky are (click through to follow):

 - The [Big Cases Bot][13] curated by Free Law Project.
 
 - The [Antitrust Bot][2] curated by the [American Economic Liberties Project][1].

 - The [Tech Bot][3] curated and sponsored by [The Verge][4].

 - The [Sealing Bot][5] and [Free Speech Bot][6] curated by [Eugene Volokh][7].

 - The [Trademark Bot][14] curated by FLP board member [Ansel Halliburton][ansel].
 
 - The [U.S. v. Trump Bot][8], [Bankruptcy Bot][9], and [AI Bot][12] curated by Free Law Project.

 - The [Psychedelic Bot][10] curated by [Psychedelic Alpha][11] and partners.

BlueSky is just the beginning. In the new year, we plan to bring these bots to chat applications like Slack, Discord, and MS Teams. If you're interested, join the waitlist below.

We hope you'll find these useful and that you'll help spread the word! If you're not on BlueSky and need an invite, [send us an email][c]. We've got lots to spread around!
