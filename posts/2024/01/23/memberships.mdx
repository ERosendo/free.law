<p className="lead">As Free Law Project grows, some of the old ways we've done things need to change and mature. Today we're making such a change so that our supporters and donors can become Free Law Project members.</p>

Before today, the way to receive benefits like more and faster [court alerts][a] was to sign up as a monthly donor to Free Law Project. That worked OK, but memberships should be a better fit: memberships mean benefits.

Along with this change, we're also raising our minimum contribution from five dollars to ten. Five dollar donations are great, but unless you get a lot of them, they don't add up very quickly. Most of our donations are closer to $50, so a small increase felt fair and reasonable. We hope you'll agree.

A few other matters to note as we make this change:

1. We plan to give Free Law Project swag to our higher-tier members starting soon. Finally! 

1. If you're currently a monthly donor, we will automatically make you a Free Law Project member. Welcome! This means everything will just keep working as it currently does.

    Any monthly donor that is currently paying five dollars per month is grandfathered in at that amount as a "Legacy Member."

1. This change is powered by a new membership and payment platform. This gives us easier payments, better compliance, and [a donor portal][p] where you can see your donations and memberships. 

1. If you prefer to make a donation instead of being a member, you can [do that too](https://donate.free.law/forms/supportflp). Thank you â€” it helps! 

Hopefully that should be it, but if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to [let us know](/contact). We're excited about this change and we hope all our supporters will be too.

Finally, if you're not a member already, we hope you'll consider signing up!
