<p className="lead">As Free Law Project grows, some of the old ways we've done things need to change and mature. Today we have made such a change so that many of our supporters and donors are now Free Law Project members.</p>

Before today, the way to receive benefits, like more and faster [court alerts][a], was to sign up as a monthly donor to Free Law Project. That worked OK, but memberships should be a better fit: Memberships mean benefits.

A few things to note as we make this change:

1. We plan to give Free Law Project swag to our higher-tier members starting soon. Finally! 

1. The lowest membership tier is ten dollars per month. 

    If you were previously a monthly donor, we have automatically made you a Free Law Project member at whatever rate you were previously paying. Welcome! This means everything will just keep working as it did before.

1. This change is powered by a new membership and payment platform. This gives us easier payments, better compliance, and [a donor portal][p] where you can see your donations and memberships. 

    Note that this means the receipts we send and your credit card statements may change slightly.

1. If you prefer to make a recurring or one-time donation instead of being a member, you can [do that too](https://donate.free.law/forms/supportflp). Thank you â€” it helps! 

Hopefully that should be it, but if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to [let us know](/contact). We're excited about this change, and we hope all our supporters will be too.

Finally, if you're not a member already, we hope you'll consider signing up!
