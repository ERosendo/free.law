<p className="lead">We're starting by publishing the proposals, justifications and contracts for Texas’ $98 million eFiling project.</p>

In our [research about court filing systems][report-blog-post], we heard over and over again: a court’s software vendor has enormous power to make (or break) the system for litigants and court staff.

But how are those vendors chosen for these multimillion dollar contracts? How much do states pay for them, and how? And what rights and responsibilities does the state give the vendor? We think court litigants and taxpayers deserve to know.

As part of our ongoing filing and case management project, we’ve requested procurement documents from the five most populous states. We’re uploading them to our [court contracts page][court-contracts-page].

To start, we’re publishing documents related to the Texas Office of Court Administration’s $98 million contract with Tyler Technologies. These include the final contract, Tyler’s (largely redacted) proposal, and the state’s justification for choosing them. (According to their press release, this was the largest contract in Tyler’s corporate history.)

Just as interesting is what states can’t give us. For example, Texas OCA has signed an agreement with Tyler to keep the pricing details of their contract secret. 

We’re just getting started. We’ll continue to request similar documents from California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Florida court administrators. As we get them, we’ll post them at the [same page][court-contracts-page].
