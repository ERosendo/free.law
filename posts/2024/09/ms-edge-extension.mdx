<p className="lead">We're thrilled to announce that our web browser extension is now officially available on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store! This marks a significant milestone for our team, as we've long aspired to bring our extension to a wider audience of users.</p>

For years, we've heard countless requests from our users for an Internet Explorer version of our extension. While we've made numerous attempts to achieve this in the past, the technical challenges and limitations of the IE platform have always presented significant hurdles.

With the introduction of Manifest V3, we finally had the tools and capabilities we needed to create a compatible version of our extension for Microsoft Edge. This major update to the web extension manifest format brought about a number of improvements that made it possible for us to bridge the gap between our existing codebase and the requirements of IE.

It's worth noting that the idea of creating an IE version of our extension isn't entirely new. In fact, one of the original creators of our extension was urging us to do so over a decade ago. However, at the time, the technical challenges involved were simply too daunting.

We're excited to see what the future holds for our extension on Microsoft Edge. With the support of Manifest V3, we're confident that we can continue to provide our users with a high-quality, reliable experience.
