Free Law Project is a small and growing non-profit that uses technology to open up legal information and make it available to researchers, journalists, individuals, and organizations. Our mission, put simply, is to use open legal data to make the legal world more competitive and accessible. 

We are creating a new Board of Advisors and are are seeking nominations of people that have the following areas of expertise:

 - Legal librarianship
 
 - Journalism
 
 - Legal research and education
 
 - Non-profit fundraising
 
 - Access to justice (pro se services, indigent representation, etc)
 
 - Public interest technology and data policy
 
 - Openness of government data, of non-profit organizations, and of technology 

Naturally, to be a good fit for our organization, we would also hope that nominated individuals would have an interest in technology and a familiarity with the legal system.

Members of our Board of Advisors will be asked by our Executive Director to serve as a sounding board and resource when challenging questions arise. Advisory members will not have voting power, but they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge and experiences and to influence the direction of the organization before decisions are made. 

If you know somebody that you think we should consider, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@free.law">info@free.law</a> with the following information:

1. The nominee's name and contact information

2. Why you think the nominee would be an excellent addition to our Advisory Board

3. Whether you prefer to nominate the person anonymously

After nominations are complete, our Board of Directors will review your recommendation and may reach out to those you identify to learn more about their potential interest.

We enthusiastically welcome emails if there are any questions we can assist with, and we thank you for considering your friends and colleagues for this role.

Thank you!
