Using support from grants, donations, services, and corporate and academic sponsorships, we:

 - Sponsor the [RECAP extensions][recap] and [RECAP Archive][archive], which gathers tens of thousands of records from PACER each day and makes them fully searchable and available.

 - Gather and curate the latest opinions from more than 200 courts daily, making them searchable in [our collection of more than 4M opinions][opinions].
 
 - Host [the largest archive of oral argument audio in the world][oa], with more than 1,100,000 minutes of recordings.
 
 - Provide [an API and bulk data][api] to researchers, journalists, and other organizations. The API is used more than 10,000 times per day and the bulk data has contributed to many startups and research projects.
 
 - Aim to have [a complete collection of machine-readable data about American appellate judges][judges]. 
 
 - Host [a visualization tool for analyzing Supreme Court citation networks][viz].

These initiatives have contributed in numerous ways to a more informed citizenry and a more fair justice system.
