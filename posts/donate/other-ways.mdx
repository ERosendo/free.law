There are many ways to support [our mission][m]. Financial support [via direct donations][donate] is usually the best way to help because it gives us the most flexibility to do our work, but we appreciate other forms of support too.

Below are some other ways to support Free Law Project.

Thank you!

## Your Personal Skills

We always need help with:

 - **Software Development**:

    If you know Django, React, Solr, AWS, or other technologies, we'd love your help fixing bugs or building new features.

 - **Fundraising, Grants, and Connections**

    Know somebody that might be a good supporter? Have connections at foundations? Are you a grant-writer with some time? We could use your help.

 - **Data Specialists & Librarians**

    Our data goes deep. We need help from folks that can research centuries-old data to the ground, and we need help just cleaning things up.
