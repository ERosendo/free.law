This year was hugely important for RECAP. We:

 - Launched the [all-new RECAP Archive][ra], where we have millions of searchable PACER documents.
 
 - [Gathered every free opinion from PACER][opinions] and made them searchable in the RECAP Archive.
 
 - [Rewrote the RECAP extensions][recap] so that they would be faster and better.

 - Created [new, searchable dockets][docket] for every case in RECAP.

 - Wrote [several award-winning advocacy pieces][lh] about PACER
   and [submitted one expert declaration][dec] about PACER costs.

 - Worked with the Administrative Office of the U.S. courts
   to [file and resolve a critical vulnerability in PACER][vuln].

It was a busy year!

## Please Support RECAP

All of the achievements and initiatives above took considerable effort, but the
results speak for themselves. Eight years after its creation, RECAP has never
been better.

At the same time, RECAP has never been more more important. With your uploads,
we have made dockets this year for cases of historical, national, and even
international significance. In 2017, we have gathered the court proceedings for
everything from the [Mueller cases][m] to the [Muslim ban][muslim]
to [Waymo v. Uber][wvu].

If you have benefited from our work this year or if you find our work valuable,
we ask that you **please donate today**. Free Law Project is a California
public benefit corporation and a federally recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit. All
donations are tax deductible.

## Finally, Thank You.

We have benefited immensely from [many sources][thanks] including individuals, organizations, and academic departments, too numerous to list here. 

We are also thankful for all of our RECAP users. You contribute to the public RECAP Archive every day. Without your contributions, and your willingness to share the documents you purchase, none of this would be possible.

Thank you for all your generous support.
