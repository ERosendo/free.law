## Where Your Support Went in 2019

Our RECAP work in 2019 had three themes:
 
1. **Increase the size and speed of the [searchable RECAP Archive][ra].** 

    In this we were wildly successful. We completed a $14,000 upgrade early in the year, making RECAP search incredibly fast, and we quadrupled the size of the RECAP Archive itself. The Archive now has [more than one hundred million docket entries][100M].

1. **Expand the number of people using the RECAP Extensions.**

    We [nearly doubled the number of people using the RECAP Extensions][20k], and now we have nearly 20,000 users contributing around 1,500 PDFs per day.

1. **Add appellate support to RECAP.**

    This continues to be a work in progress. We hope to have it complete early next year.

## Please Support RECAP

All of the achievements and initiatives above took considerable effort. This year RECAP turned ten years old and it has never had more users, more data to share, or more functionality.

We also think RECAP has never been more more important to our society. With your uploads, we have been able to host numerous dockets of historical significance. In 2019, the courts became more important than ever, and we were proud to help the public and the press follow these cases as they unfolded. 

If you have benefited from our work this year, or if you find our work valuable, we ask that you **please donate today**. 

Free Law Project is a California public benefit corporation, and is a federally recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit. All donations are tax deductible.



## Finally, Thank You.

We have benefited immensely from [many sources][thanks] including individuals, organizations, and academic departments, too numerous to list here. 

We are also thankful for all of our RECAP users. You contribute to the public RECAP Archive every day. Without your support and without your willingness to share the documents you purchase, none of this would be possible.

Thank you for all your generous support.
