<SimpleDisclosure buttonText={"Why am I seeing this?"}>
  <p>You have the RECAP extension installed. In exchange for hosting RECAP for free and saving you money on your PACER purchases, we occasionally ask for your support.
  </p>
  <p>If RECAP has saved you time or money, we hope you will support it.</p>
  <p>Sorry to interrupt you.</p>
</SimpleDisclosure>


<p className="lead">The RECAP extension is provided by Free Law Project, a non-profit that works to improve the justice system. This is our website. Once per year we ask for donations so we can continue hosting and enhancing RECAP.
</p>
<p class="lead">The more support you give, the more we are able to do.</p>

We need your support to continue enhancing and maintaining the RECAP system. If RECAP has saved you money or if you believe in what we do, please help us with a tax-deductible donation now.

 ## Where Your Support Went in 2021

Our RECAP work in 2021 had five themes:

1. **Free PACER Advocacy**

    The "Free PACER" bill is on the move in Congress. We're working hard to make it pass. If it does, we will finally have free access to everything in PACER.

1. **Increase the size and speed of RECAP**

    RECAP now has nearly <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/">200-million docket entries</a>.

    If you printed and stacked all the PDFs in PACER, they'd be 8.3km high — about 10× the height of the tallest building on Earth.

1. **Add support for Safari on macOS, iPhone and iPad**

    This is in beta now and we'll be saying more about it in the new year!

1. **Big Cases Bot**

    We will have a lot more to say about this soon, but in the new year, you can expect a major rejuvenation of the [Big Cases bot][bcb].

1. **Upgrade RECAP long-term storage**

    This year we moved our storage to a cloud provider so that viral documents can't slow us down. This was a huge and expensive upgrade, but it brings speed and reliability we never had before.

And of course, we do a lot more than just RECAP at Free Law Project. Read our report to learn more.

## Please Support RECAP and Free Law Project

Everything above took considerable effort by our dedicated team of developers and advocates. It's a huge undertaking to run a system as big and complicated as RECAP, and we really need your help to do it.

RECAP has never been more important to society. With every passing year, we have more users and more downloads from our website. In a time when misinformation is rampant, we provide Americans with free and instant access to a vast collection of legal information.

If you have benefited from our work this year, or if you find our work valuable, we ask that you donate now.

Free Law Project is a California public benefit corporation, and is a federally recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit. All donations are tax-deductible.

## Finally, Thank You.

We have benefited immensely from [many sources][thanks] including individuals, organizations, and academic departments, too numerous to list here. 

We are also thankful to you — a normal RECAP user. You contribute to RECAP and make it the incredible resource that it is. Without your support and without your willingness to share the documents you purchase, none of this would be possible.

Thank you for all your generous support.

[thanks]: /thanks/
