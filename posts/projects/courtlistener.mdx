[CourtListener.com][cl] is our flagship project, and is the home of many of our other projects, including:

 - [**Eyecite**][eye] and [**Reporters Database**][rdb] our tools for pulling citations out of text;

 - [**Juriscraper**][js], our tool for gathering opinions and filings from court websites;

 - [**The RECAP Archive**][recap], a collection of tens of millions of searchable federal court documents;

 - [**The Judge DB**][jdb], where we have structured data about thousands of judges; and

 - [**Our Oral Argument Database**][oa], the largest collection of court recordings online.

CourtListener is fully searchable and can be used to research [opinions][op], [federal court filings][cl-recap], [judges][cl-jdb], or [oral argument recordings][audio].

On a good day, CourtListener gets tens of thousands of new items added to it, it sends hundreds of [alerts][alerts] to users monitoring cases or search terms, and it serves over a million people.

Finally, for developers, CourtListener is where we have our [APIs and database replication][api]. These powerful tools help journalists, researchers, and organizations our data to build the next generation of technology.
