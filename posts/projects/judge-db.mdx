<p className="lead">For the benefit of researchers and practitioners, we are proud to host a comprehensive and growing structured database of judges and the judiciary.</p>

The database contains information about thousands of state and federal judges and judicial appointers such as governors and presidents. Information currently includes biographical data about each person, their financial disclosure records, the roles they have held before, during and after their time in the judicial branch, their political affiliations, their education, and any retention events that kept them in a judicial position (such as a reappointment).

We hope this database, its APIs, and its bulk data will be valuable tools for practitioners and researchers across the country.

Free Law Project created this project in conjunction with [Elliott Ash][e] of Princeton University with support from the National Science Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, [Justia][j], and Pre/Dicta.


## What's next?

The database is a constant work in progress, and we are regularly adding more judges and information about them.
