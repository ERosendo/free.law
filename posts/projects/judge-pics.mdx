<p className="lead">Our database of judicial portraits is an open collection of meticulously cropped, edited, and organized photos of judges that can be dropped into websites or other applications.</p>

These pictures cover federal circuit and district judges from all time periods and jurisdictions.  While we continue to add and round out our already robust collection of data on federal and state judges, these pictures add a visual  element that straight data lacks.

The images themselves are hosted in a Git repository, where they're available in widths of 128, 256, and 512 pixels. Of course if those sizes don't work for you, the original photos are available too.

This project has been supported by NSF Grant SES-1260875 and Pre/Dicta.
