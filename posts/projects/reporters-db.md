Juriscraper is a scraper library written in Python that gathers judicial
opinions, PACER content, and oral arguments from the American court system. It
is currently able to scrape:

- Opinions from all major appellate Federal courts

- Opinions from all state courts of last resort (typically their "Supreme
  Court")

- Oral arguments from all appellate federal courts that offer them

- A variety of content from PACER

Jursicraper has a robust test suite and underpins much of the functionality of
the CourtListener system. It's no exaggeration to say that Juriscraper has
scraped tens of millions of court records.

Juriscraper aims to be a unified scraper framework that organizations can use
to get the latest content from American courts. We hope this tool will be an
asset to your scraping work and that you'll join us in using it.
