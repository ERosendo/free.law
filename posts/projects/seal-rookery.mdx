<p className="lead">The Judicial Seals Repository is a small project to collect and organize all of the judicial seals in use in the United States. At present, it has approximately 250 judicial seals.</p>

This project can be useful if you need to display or look up the seal of a court. For example, at right you can see the seal of the Supreme Court.

A collection of court seals can be useful for a number of projects. At CourtListener, we use these to enhance the album art for oral argument recordings that we collect, but they can be used in a number of other ways as well.

To learn more about these seals, see their page on the Python Package Index (PyPi) or on Github.
