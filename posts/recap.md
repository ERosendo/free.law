## The Archives and APIs

Thanks to our users and our [data consulting projects][data], the [RECAP Archive][archive] contains tens of millions of PACER documents, including [every free opinion in PACER][free]. Everything in the archive is fully searchable, including millions of pages that were originally scanned PDFs.

Everything that is in the RECAP Archive is also regularly uploaded to [the Internet Archive][ia-itself], where it has [a lasting home][ia]. This amounts to thousands of liberated documents daily.

Finally, we make the RECAP Archive available via an API or as bulk data for journalists, researchers, startups, and developers.

## What People are Saying

<blockquote>
  <p>Recap is an invaluable resource for journalists, activists - and really anyone who cares about law and justice in the United States. The work of the Free Law Project puts our courts within reach for everyone, and reinforces a pillar of democracy that is often overlooked. Everyone should support — and contribute — to this effort.</p>
  <footer className="text-gray-400">&mdash; Charles Duhigg, <cite>Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for New York Times</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are a PACER user, I strongly encourage you to download RECAP.</p>
  <footer className="text-gray-400">&mdash; Todd Ito of the <cite>Chicago Association of Law Libraries</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Citizens deserve open and easy access to all public court documents. Until public access becomes a matter of policy rather than blocked by PACER's artificial pay wall, independent efforts like RECAP continue to fill a critical gap in our ability to foster a more participatory and engaged democracy.</p>
