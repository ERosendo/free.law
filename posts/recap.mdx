title: RECAP Project — Turning PACER Around Since 2009
type: page
excerpt: RECAP is an online archive and free extension for Firefox, Chrome and Safari that improves the experience of using PACER, the electronic public access system for the U.S. Federal District and Bankruptcy Courts. Once installed, every docket or PDF you purchase on PACER will be added to the [RECAP Archive][archive]. Anything somebody else has added to the archive will be available to you for free — right in PACER itself.

## If you use PACER, install RECAP.

Once installed, every docket or PDF you purchase on district and bankruptcy court PACER websites will be added to the [RECAP Archive][archive]. Anything somebody else has added to the archive will be available to you for free — right in PACER itself.

Tens of thousands of people have used RECAP. To join them, simply install it using the button above, and then use PACER as you normally would. It's that simple. If you don't like it, you can uninstall at any time.

## The Archives and APIs

Thanks to our users and our [data consulting projects][data], the [RECAP Archive][archive] contains tens of millions of PACER documents, including [every free opinion in PACER][free]. Everything in the archive is fully searchable, including millions of pages that were originally scanned PDFs.

Everything that is in the RECAP Archive is also regularly uploaded to [the Internet Archive][ia-itself], where it has [a lasting home][ia]. This amounts to thousands of liberated documents daily.

Finally, we make the RECAP Archive available via an API or as bulk data for journalists, researchers, startups, and developers.

## What People are Saying

<blockquote>
  <p>Recap is an invaluable resource for journalists, activists - and really anyone who cares about law and justice in the United States. The work of the Free Law Project puts our courts within reach for everyone, and reinforces a pillar of democracy that is often overlooked. Everyone should support — and contribute — to this effort.</p>
  <footer className="text-gray-400">&mdash; Charles Duhigg, <cite>Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for New York Times</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are a PACER user, I strongly encourage you to download RECAP.</p>
  <footer className="text-gray-400">&mdash; Todd Ito of the <cite>Chicago Association of Law Libraries</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Citizens deserve open and easy access to all public court documents. Until public access becomes a matter of policy rather than blocked by PACER's artificial pay wall, independent efforts like RECAP continue to fill a critical gap in our ability to foster a more participatory and engaged democracy.</p>
