title: RECAP Extension — Privacy Policy
type: page
---

This privacy policy governs the RECAP browser extension (the “RECAP Extension” or the “Extension”). 

YOUR USE OF THE RECAP EXTENSION CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS, ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THESE TERMS, AND THE [PRIVACY POLICY][cl-pp], [TERMS OF SERVICE][cl-tos] AND [COPYRIGHT POLICY][copyright] OF COURTLISTENER.COM, A RELATED INITIATIVE OF FREE LAW PROJECT. 

This document describes what information the RECAP Extensions collect from our users and what we will and will not do with it.

The RECAP Extensions do not transmit any information to any third party. Users cannot log into the RECAP Extensions and the Extensions do not access, log, or store any personally-identifiable information. 

The RECAP Extensions do not access your PACER credentials.


### Your Usage of the RECAP Extension

As a RECAP Extension user browses PACER:

1. The extension automatically uploads federal records to CourtListener.com, a related initiative of Free Law Project. Some of these records, such as PACER "receipt pages" may contain personally-identifiable information such as your PACER username.

2. The extension queries CourtListener.com to determine if a user-sought record is available for download. This query transmits information about the court, case, and record sought so that CourtListener.com can respond.

3. The extension shows links to CourtListener.com, so extension users can freely download federal records. If a RECAP Extension user uses such a link to download content from CourtListener.com, log records about that download may be created by CourtListener.com.

Content uploaded to CourtListener.com, queries made to CourtListener.com, and log records created on CourtListener.com are bound by the [Terms of Service][cl-tos], [Privacy Policy][cl-pp], and [Copyright Policy][copyright] of CourtListener.com.


### Changes

We reserve the right to change our privacy policy from time to time at our sole discretion. Please periodically check this section to review the current version of the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the RECAP System following the posting of such changes will constitute your assent to all such changes.
