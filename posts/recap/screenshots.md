After you install RECAP and begin using PACER, you'll see a few changes. In general, we aim to help you by adding links to free RECAP content wherever we can. Below are a few examples of what PACER will look like if you browsed the [Stormy Daniels case][stormy] while using RECAP.

We keep the RECAP settings very simple. In general, just install it and forget it. But there are a few options.

         alt="Preferences menu for RECAP"/>
    <p className="caption">In the preferences, you can adjust whether you want to get notifications for you uploads, whether you want confirmations before downloading documents from RECAP, the style of filename you want for PDFs you purchase, and whether you want to temporarily deactivate RECAP.</p>
