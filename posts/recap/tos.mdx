These Terms of Use (the "Terms") govern the following: 

1. the RECAP Extension for Firefox, Chrome, Safari or other browsers (the “RECAP Extension” or the “Extension”); and
2. the RECAP Extension Server, hosted at CourtListener.com, with which the Extension interacts (the “RECAP Extension Server” or the “Extension Server”). 

Collectively, the Extension and the Extension Server form the "RECAP System".

YOUR USE OF THE RECAP SYSTEM CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THESE TERMS. DO NOT USE THE RECAP SYSTEM IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS.

We reserve the right to change these terms from time to time at our sole discretion. Please periodically check this section to review the current version of the Terms. Your continued use of the RECAP System following the posting of such changes will constitute your assent to all such changes.


## Contributions to RECAP

You understand that by using the RECAP Extension you are requesting that public records downloaded by you from PACER are automatically uploaded to IA via the RECAP Extension Server.

Free Law Project is not responsible for any contributions from users (including but not limited to public records uploaded to IA) which may be indecent or otherwise objectionable. You understand that, though we will investigate such materials, users bear sole responsibility for their contributions. If you discover indecent or otherwise objectionable materials that we should be aware of, please [let us know][c].
