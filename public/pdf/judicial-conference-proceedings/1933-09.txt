   State of the dockets.-Nttmber of cases begun, disposed
of, and pending, in the Federal District Courts.-The At­
torney General submitted to the Conference a report of
the 'condition of the dockets of the Federal District Courts
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933, as compared with
the previous fiscal year. Each Circuit Judge also pre­
sented to the Conference a detailed report, 'by districts, of
the work of the courts in his circuit.
   The report of the Attorney General showed the compara­
tivp. number of cases in each of the four major classes com­
                                      2
    menced and terminated during the fiscal years 1932 and
    1933, respectively, as follows:
                                      Commenced          Terminated
                                      1932   1933      1932    1933
    United States civil cases ....   34,189 25,797    29,591   27,744
    Criminal cases ............      92,174 82,675    96,949   84,780
    Private suits ..............     26,326 26,656    26,045 26,074
    Bankruptcy petitions ......      70,049 62,256    63,502   67,031

        Total ................. 220,738     197,384   216,087   205,629 

       The number of cases terminated exceeded the number
    filed during 1933, and there was a general decrease in all
    classes except private suits, as compared with the previous
    year. The total number of cases filed in 1933 was 25,354
    less than in 1932, and the total number terminated was
    10,458 less than in 1932. There was a small increase in
I   the number of private suits commenced and terminated.
       The Attorney General gave the following comparative

)   statement of pending cases:

                                                                 1933 

                                                                 24,293 

                                                                 20,907

        Total .................................. 159,387        151,034 

      The above figures indicate that the congestion of the
    dockets in the district courts (except with respect to pri­
    vate suits) is gradually being reduced. The total number
    of cases of all kinds was reduced by 8,353 between June 30,
    1932, and June 30, 1933. The number of private suits pend­
    ing increased by 582 during the same period.
      War Risk Insurance cases.-Of the 24,293 United States'
    civil cases pending at the close of June 30, 1933, more than
    43 per cent were suits against the Government under the
    Veterans' Insurance acts. The total number pending on
    June 30, 1933, was 10,597 as compared with 10,228 on June
    30, 1932,-an increase of 369.
                                                                                    77
                                         3

(     Criminal cases in geneml.-Some progress was made in
    reducing the congestion in the criminal dockets. On June
    30, 1932, there were pending in the dIstrict courts a total
    of 23,012 criminal cases of all classes. The number com­
    menced during the fiscal year was 82,675 and the number
    terminated was 84,780, leaving 20,907 pending on June 30,
    1933, as shown by the following table:
      Ctiminal cases-                                      1932        1933

    Pending close of year .....................           23,120·     20,907 

      National Prohibition Act.-Fewer cases of this character
    were commenced and terminated during the fiscal year
    1933, as compared with the fiscal year 1932. The total
    number of criminal cases pending at the close of the· year
    was only 13,646 as compared with 15,360 at the close of the
    previous year, as shown by the following table:
      Prohibition criminal cases-                             1932        1933

    Pending close of year ...................... .           15,360      13,646 

      Sixty-five per cent of all criminal cases pending on June
    30, 1933, were prohibition cases.
      P"ohibitio1'lt--Civil cases.-The ngmber of civil cases
    under the National Prohibition Act commenced, terminated
    and pending during the fiscal years 1932 and 1933 was as
    follows:
      ProMbition civil-                              1932                1933

       ·The discrepancy of 108 cases pending ill stated by the Attorney General
    to be due to careful revision after checking the dockets in the Southern Dis­
    trict of New York.

                     The number of such eases commenced and terminated
                   was considerably less in 1933 than in 1932, and the num­
                   ber pending at the close of 1933 was only 5,148 as compared
                   with 6,940 at the close of the previous year.
                     Circuit Courts of Appeals.-These courts have continued
                   to keep up with their work in a satisfactory manner.
                     District Courts.-Removal of Restrictions upon Ap­
                   pointment of Successors in Existing Judgeships.-Restric­
                   tions are now imposed by statute upon the filling of vacan­
                   cies in certain existing jUdgeships. The Conference has
                   carefully considered the desirability of the removal of these
                   restrictions so that successors can be appointed in the cases
                   in which vacancies occur, where experience has shown the
                   necessity of having a permanent, instead of a temporary,
                   judgeship. As a result of its examination of conditions in

I                  each District, the Conference last year recommended that
                   the following judgeships should be made permanent by
                   removing the existing limitation upon the appointment of

I                  successors:
                         2
                         2
                             in the district of Massachusetts; 

                             in the southern district of New York; 

                         1   in the eastern district of New York; 

                         1   in the western district of Pennsylvania; 

                         1   in the eastern district of Michigan; 

                         1   ill the eastern district of Missouri; 

                         1   in the western district of Missouri; 

                         1   in the northern district of Ohio; 

                         1   in the southern district of California; 

                         1   in the district of Arizona; 

                         1   in the district of Minnesota; 

                         1   in the southern district of Iowa. 

                      The importance of making appropriate prOV1SlOn for
                   the filling of such vacancies, before the vacancies actually
                   arise, is shown by the situation in the eastern district of
                   Michigan, one of the judgeships above mentioned. That
                                                                        79
                                      5
        judgeship was held by Judge Simons, and on his appoint­
        ment as circuit judge there was no provision for filling the
        vacancy in the district court in the, eastern district of
        Michigan; in consequence, the work of that court has been
        seriously impeded. Another illustration is found in the
        inability, under the existing statute, to fill the vacancy in
        the southern district of New York which arose on the resig­
        nation of Judge 'Winslow (since deceased). The attention
        of the Conference was directed to the situations in other
        districts, special mention being made of those in Missoud,
        Minnesota, and Iowa, \vhere the business is very heavy and
        serious impairment of the administration of justice will
        result in case vacancies should arise which, under the pres­
        ent limitation, could not be filled.
           Provision for additional District Judgeships.-What has
        been said above relates to properly maintaining the· exist­
        ing judicial service, who;;e judgeships, although temporary,
        have already been created. In addition to these, there is
        imperative necessity for an increased number of judges.
        The Conference last year recommended the creation of ad­
        ditional judgeships as follows:
               2 additional district judges for the southern dis­
                 trict of New York;
               1 additional district judge for the eastern district
                 of New York;
               1 additional district judge for the northern district
                 of Georgia;
               1 additional district judge for West Virginia;
               1 additional district judge for the southern district
                 of Texas;
               2 additional district judges for the southern district
                 of California;
              1 additional district judge for the western district
                 of Missouri.
          On a further consideration of the question, the Con­
        ference believes that this recommendation was fully justi.

l..-i

                                      6
         fied, but in view of existing economic conditions the COll­
          ference refrains from renewing the recommendation at
          this time, without prejudice to its later renewal, except in
          the following installces where provision for additional
          judgeships is deemed to be imperatively required;-that is
          to say, the following additional district judges should be
          provided:
                  2 additional district judges for the southern dis­
                    trict of New York;
                  2 additional district judges for the southern dis­
                    trict of California.
             It should be added that, in addition to the judgeships
          listed in last year's recommendation, as above stated, the
          Conference has found that there is serious need for in­
          creased judicial service in Oklahoma, which might be af­
I         forded by an additional district judge for the western dis­
          trict of Oklahoma, but reconup.endation to this effect is
          withheld for the time being in view of the existing situa­

I         tion and of the special need which exists in the southern
          district of New York and the southern district of Cali­
          fornia.
            Places of holdifl,g terms of the Circuit Court of Appeals
         for the Fifth Circuit.-The Conference has heretofore
         recommended that sessions of the Circuit Court of Ap­
         peals for the Fifth Circuit should be held only at New
         Orleans, Louisiana, and the Conference deems the matter'
         worthy of serious consideration by the Congress.
            Recommendations of Legislation.--On consideration of
         proposed legislative measures which the Attorney General
         brought to the attention of the Conference, the Conference
         expressed its approval of the following:
            Proposed Bill:-To prevent the invalidation of an in­
         dictment because of the service of one or more unqualified
         persons upon the grand jury, if it shall appear that twelve
         or more grand jurors not disqualified concurred in the
         finding of the indictment.
                              i
   Proposed Bill:-Where the senior circuit judge of a cir­
cuit is disabled by illnes's, to permit his powers to be exer­
cised by the other judges of the circuit in the order of the
seniority of their respective commissions.
  Proposed Bill:-To relieve United States district judges
of the duty of certifying to the expense accounts of United
States Attorneys and their Assistants.
  Proposed Bill:-To amend existing law so as to abolish
the requirement of a certificate by United States District
Judges as to the necessity for the appointment of Assistant
United States Attorneys.
   Proposed Bill :-To amend the general criminal statute
of limitations in criminal cases so as to permit the United
States to re-indict at any "ime within the next succeeding
term of court, in cases where a demurrer or other dilatory
plea to the indictment is sustained, after the period of limi­
tation has ruu, on the ground that the indictment is bad as
a plea.
   The Conference again expresses its opinion that legis­
lation making the husband or wife of a person charged with
crime in United States courts a competent, but not a com­
pellable witness for or against his or her spouse, except
as to confidential communications, is highly desirable.
  A1nendment of legislation with respect to the Judicial
Conference.-The Conference has heretofore requested the
Attorney General to urge such change in the statute, under
which the Conference is organized, as should expressly
authorize the Conference to recommend to the Congress,
from time to time, "such changes in statutory law affecting
the jurisdiction, practice, evidence and procedure of, and
in the different district courts and circuit courts of appeals
as may to the Conference seem desirable." The Confer­
ence renews its recommendation as to the advisability of
this legislation.
  Rules of practice and procedure in criminal cases after
verdict.-By Act of Congress approved February 24, 1933,
the Supreme Court is authorized to prescribe rules of prac­
:   .-­
          82

                                             8
                tice and procedure with respect to any or all proceedings
                after verdict in criminal cases in District Courts of the
                United States and in the United States Circuit Courts of
                Appeals. At the request of the Chief Justice, Attorney
                General Mitchell submitted a draft of proposed rules which
                had been prepared in the Department of Justice under the
                direct supervision, and with the personal attention, of
                Solicitor General Thacher. The Chief Justice submitted
                 this draft to the circuit judges, to the end that the pro­
                posals might be the subject of discussion at this Conference.
                The senior circuit judges gave careful consideration to the
                proposals and consulted with other circuit judges and with
                district judges so that the views of the federal judiciary
                should find appropriate expression on this importantsuh­
                ject, as an aid to the deliberation and action of the Supreme
                Court.
                   The senior circuit judges brought to the Conference the
                results of their consultations and study; and the provisions
                 of the proposed rules, in their most important aspects,
                were the subject of extensive examination by the Confer­
                 ence, with a full interchange of views, which were recorded
                 for the purpose of submission to the Supreme Court.
                 These proceedings of the Conference were extremely help­
                 ful, not only with respect to the immediate purposes in
               . view, but also as they brought before the Conference,
                 vividly and in detail, the existing causes of delays in th.~
                 prosecution of criminal appeals and the remedies which
                 may be deemed to be available.
                 General orders in bankruptcy.-The Conference also
               considered questions relating to ancillary receiverships in
               bankrnptcy, particularly with respect to proposals that
               have been made for consideration by the Supreme Court.

                 For the Judicial Conference:
