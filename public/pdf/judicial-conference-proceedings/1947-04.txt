throughout the session.
   Bankruptcy Administration.-The Act of June 28, 1946,2
known as the Referees' Salary Act (hereinafter referred to as
the amendatory act), contemplates the abolition of the "fee and
commission" system of compensating referees for services ren­
dered, and the institution of a fixed salary basis of compensa­
tion with a view toward "creating and maintaining a system of
full- time referees."
   The enactment of this legislation represents the first time
that a departure from the established fee and commission basis
of payment for referees in bankruptcy has been permitted by
the Congress. While this method of payment is as old as the
system itself,3 the belatedness of legislative authorization for
a change is not indicative of a theretofore efficient and gener­
ally approved system. Criticism of the manner of payment
arose almost as soon as the system became effective.'
   The Bankruptcy Act and its administration has been the
subject of exhaustive and extensive study by public and private
 parties almost since its inception. 5 In practically every in­
 stance, the defects of the fee and commission system of pay­
ment, as well as the necessity for a full-time system of referees,

   'Inasnlllch as the Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 517. 518) creating a "register"
provides the earliest ofticer comparable to the present referee, and since the
acts of 1898 and 1938 continue.d in effect the commission baSis of payment,
the Act of 1867 for the purposes of this report, is considered as establishing
the present system of payment.
   • ,.§ 10 of tile 1867 Act Pl'OV ided for fees for the register to be fixed by tile
Supreme Court. Considemble complaint about the system resulted only in
a modification of the schedule of fees in 1874. \Vhell the Bankruptcy Act
of 1898 was passed, tile fee syst€'m was r(·tained, and 110 challge was made
by the Chandler Act of 1938." Atty. Gen'l Comm'sd rept. 1940, p. 84.
   '''Numerous public anel private studies have been made of the Bankruptcy
Act almost since its inception. Of particular importance, however, are the
illvestigations conducted by Col. William J. Donovan, 1929 (H. Comm. Print,
7lst Congo 3d Sess.) ; by Sol. Gen'l Thomas D. 'I'hatcher in 1930-31 (S. Doc.
No. 65, 72d Congo 1st sess.) ; by William G. McAdoo from 1933 to 1935 (InveS­
tigation of Bankl'uptcy and Receiyership Proceedings in United States Courts,
pursuant to S. Res. 78, 73d Congo 2d sess.) ; and the investigation made for
the Senate Judiciary Committee by Percival E. Jackson in 1936 (S. Doc. No.
268, 74th Congo 2d sess.)." Atty. General Comm's. rept. (HMO), note 1, p. 1.

-   have been recognized and recommendations for improvements
    therein made.s And, although numerous efforts have been
    made to secure legislative approval for a change to a salary basis
    none was successful until the present authorization was
    granted. 7
       In April 1939, Attorney General Frank Murphy, now
    an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
    States) appointed a Conmlittee to examine the administration
    of the Bankruptcy Act.B In its course of study, the Committee

    Report, p. 125 and the Jackson l'pt. p. 73, footnote 5, supra. The Donovan
    R(eport (1930) while recognizing the deficiency of the system made no recom~
    mendations, stating that further study was necessary.
       The desirability of a limitation in the number of referees had been recog­
    nized even before the Act of 1&98. The ea1'I;\' Lowell bill [fn. 7] attempted:
    to limit the number of referees by providing for one referee for each con­
    grpssional distt'ict. The Torrey Bm went pven farthel', and provided that in
    en;;e a l'efpree elosed fewel' tllan 50 eases ill any ~'ear, hz was to be dropped,
    and his territory consolidated with that of the existing referees. See

    draft of the Chandler Act submitted by the National Bankruptcy Conference
    in 19B5, p. 112 (note).
       1 In 1881 Judge Lowell of Massachusetts drafted a bill which would author­

    ize a change to a salary basis. It was introduced in Congress that year, and
    persistently thereafter until 1898. In 1889 Col. Torrey of St. Louis drafted
    a bill which was introduced in 1800 and finally passed as the Bankruptcy Act
    of 1898, which also contained provision to place the referees on a salary basis.
    However, just hefore the Torrey bill passed, the salary provision was dropped.

    in connection with the Thacher Comm.'s Rpt. Hnd recommendations; the

 pursued every avenue consistent with its resources to deter­
mine facts and opinions on the problems under consideration.
 Basic data were collected by numerous questionnaires sent not
                                                                                  -
.only to persons engaged in bankruptcy administration, such as
district judges, referees, trustees, and receivers, but also to
 those with special knowledge or wide experience in bankruptcy,
'Such as credit organizations, bar associations, members of the
 National Bankruptcy Conference and the like. Personal inter­
 views were had, field studies were made in several cities, avail­
 able statistical data in the Department of Justice, and other
government agencies, were analyzed and, in addition, approxi­
 mately 1,750 recently closed cases were scrutinized with the
cooperation of many of the law schools of the country.9
    The Committee completed its work and submitted its report
to the Attorney General in December 1940. In a general sum­
 marization of the report, the Committee stated, in part, as
follows:
           Unfortunately, the reform of bankruptcy procedures
        during the past decade has not been accompanied by
        corresponding improvements in administration. The
        need was recognized; each of the major studies has ac­
        companied its recommendations for procedural changes
                                                                                 -
        with recommendations for improvement in supervision
        and coordination of administration. It is to that ques­
        tion that this study is primarily devoted.
           This report deals with two aspects of bankruptcy ad­
        ministration which the Committee believes present the
        paramount need for reform at the present time. The
Shea (later Assistant Attorney General of the United States), University
of Buffalo Law School, and Max Lowenthal, Counsel, Subcommittee of the
Committee on Interstate Commerce, United States Senate.
  Dean Shea was initially made the Director. Shortly after the naming of
the Committee, Dean Shea was appointed an Assistant Attorney General,
and his place was taken by Charles A. Horsley, Esq., of the District of Colum­
bia Bar; and, upon the appointment of Hon. Robert H. Jackson as Attorney
General. the Chairmanship of the Committee was taken by Assistant At­
torney General Shea. George 'S. Elpern and Leon Frechtel, of the New
York Bar, served as Asst. Directors; and Sidney Schwartz, also of the New
York Bar, served as an assistant in research.                                    ..­

                  first of these aspects is the present lack of, and the
                  necessity for creating, some effective and responsible
                  coordination and supervision of bankruptcy administra­
                  tion as a whole. The second aspect is the necessity for
                  improving the referee ship system by limiting the num­
                  ber of referees, putting each of them on a full-time basis,
                  sud modifying the anachronistic system under which
                  they are at present compensated and their expenses paid.

                     [So far as the first aspect of the Committee's report
                  is concerned, the establishment, pursuant to action of
                  the Judicial Conference, in January 1941, of a Bank­
                  ruptcy Division in the Administrative Office of the
                  United States Courts, meets the Committee's recom­
                  mendations.]
              On January 21, 1941, upon request of the Attorney General,
           and pursuant to call of the Chief Justice (the Hon. Charles
           Evans Hughes), the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit
.f""", 	   Judges met in special session to consider the report and recom­
\wi 	      mendations of the Attorney General's Committee. And, after
           full consideration of the report, the Conference, with respect to
           the proposals to place referees on a fixed salary basis, and to
           inaugurate a full-time system of referees, adopted the following
           resolution:
                     Re8olved, That it is the sense of the Conference that
                   the fee system for the pay of referees in bankruptcy
                   should be abolished and a system of full-time referees
                  at fixed salaries, as recommended by the Attorney Gen­
                  eral's committee, should be adopted for the country at
                  large in so far as such system may be justified by local
                   conditions; further, that a nation-wide survey should
                  be conducted by the Director of the Administrative Of­
                  fice with view of determining whether or not such sys­
                  tem is practicable in all districts and areas of the coun­
                   try and, if not, to what extent it should be supplemented
                   by part-time referees on a salary basis; and further, that
                                    6
       both with respect to full-time referees and with respect
       to such part-time salaried referees as may be found                      _
       necessary, the Conference should be authorized, upon
       the recommendation of the Director, to determine the
       number of referees, the territory over which each shall
       exercise jurisdiction, the salaries they shall receive, and
       any changes which may be made with respect to these
       matters (Rpt., Jud. Conf. Spec. Sess., Jan. 1941, p. 3):
and, thereupon, adopted the following recommendations:
          1. That the legislation to be enacted authorize this
       Conference to determine whether part time salaried ref­
       erees are necessary in any district or area of the country
       in lieu of the full time referees proposed in the report;
          2. That the Director be authorized by such legislation
       to conduct a nation-wide survey with a view of deter­
       mining the number of full time salaried referees and,
       if the appointment of part time salaried referees is rec­
       ommended, the number of such part time salaried ref­
       erees, together with the territory to be served by each
       in either case, and the salaries to be paid them, and to
       report the result of his findings to this Conference and
       to the various Circuit Councils of the circuits for which
       such referees are to be appointed, and such Councils
       shall make recommendations to this Conference with re­
       gard thereto;
          3. That this Conference be vested with authority to
       determine, in the light of recommendations of the Di­
       rector and of the Circuit Councils, the exact number
       of referees to be appointed, the territory over which
        they shall exercise jurisdiction, the salaries they shall
        receive, and any changes which may be made thereafter
        as to their respective numbers, territories, or salaries; 10

  ,. While the Conference was in accord generally with the principles and 

objectives of the Attorney General's Committee. it differed with the Com­

mittee's thoughts with respect to the manIl01' of tbeir accomplishment. 

The major differences concerned full-time employment of all referees, the 

Conference agreeing this should be done where practical, but where not,
part-time referees sholllrl be named; the lllaIllIer of appointment; the des­   -

  The Conference in a subsequent session, September 1942,
authorized the Chief Justice to appoint a committee of the
Conference to consider and report on matters of Bankruptcy
Administration. The Chief Justice (Hon. Harlan Fiske
Stone), thereupon, designated the following as members of
this Committee:*
        United States Circuit Judges:
            Orie L. Phillips, Denver, Chairman.
            Jerome N. Frank, New York, N. Y.
            John B. Sanborn, S1. Paul, Minn.
        United States District Judges:
            William C. Coleman, Baltimore, Md.
            F. Ryan Duffy, Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
            H. Church Ford, Lexington, Ky.
            Ralph Jij. Jenney, San Diego, Calif.
  * The personnel of this Committee has remained the same since this
designation, excepting Judge Jenney, who died in July 1945. District Judge
Claude McColloch, of Portland, Oregon, was designated to succeed him.
Since its creation, the Committee has followed closely the
legislative proposals affecting the Conference's recommenda­
tions.
   The first effort to secure legislative authorization necessary
for the effectuation of the Conference's recommendations, was
the introduction in the House of Representatives of a bill (H. R.
4394) by Representative Charles F. McLaughlin, Chairman of
the special subcommittee on Bankruptcy and Reorganization,
of the House Judiciary Committee, during the first session of
the 77th Congress. Extensive hearings were had on the bill,
and the proposed legislation, with some Committee amend­
ments, was reported favorably by the Committee. However,
this effort failed to succeed, and similar bills were introduced
in the 78th and 79th Congresses by Representative Sam Hobbs,
of Alabama, a member of the House Judiciary Committee.
During the 79th Congress, some further amendments to the
bill were proposed and incorporated in a bill (H. R. 4160) in­
i;.mation of jurisdiction, the fixing of salaries (amount), etc.
                                                              1;'01' the pur­
l;nse of full comparh,on, reference is made to the Report of the Attorney
General's Committee (1940) PP. 132, et seq., and the Report of the Judicial
Conff'rence, Special Session, January 1941, pp. 3, et seq.

troduced by Representative Chauncey W. Reed, of Illinois,
also a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Hearings
on the bill were held by the Committee which reported it fa­
vorably to the House, where it passed without opposition. It
passed the Senate with minor amendments and was approved
by the President on June 28,1946.11
   Thus, the present amendatory act is the result of years of
continuous concerted effort on the part of the three branches
of government--the Legislative, the Executive, and the Judi·
cial.
   Section 4 of the amendatory act provides, in part, as follows:
            SEC. 4. Section 37 of such Act, as amended, is
         amended to read as follows:
            "SEC. 37. NUMBER AND TERRITORIES OF REFEREEs.-a.
         The Director shall recommend to the district judges, the
         councils and the conference the number of referees to
         hold appointment and the territory which each shall
         serve, after he has made a careful study of conditions
         throughout the country as a whole, and of local condi­
         tions, including the estimated amount of funds avail­           c
         able for salaries, the areas and the populations to be
         served, the transportation and communication facilities,
         the previous types and amount of business under this
         Act in such areas and where such business is centered,
         the existing personnel, and any other material factors.
         The territory of a referee may, if it is deemed advisable,
         lie within more than one judicial district, but shall be
         within one circuit: Provided, however, That the juris­
         diction of a referee in any matter referred to him shall
         not be restricted to the territory to be served by him but
         shall, unless otherwise provided in this Act, be coexten­
         sive with the territorial jurisdiction of the court or courts
         of bankruptcy whose judges participated in appointing
         him.

     sions a and c of section 40, paragraph (2) of section 633,
     and paragraph (3) of section 659 of this Act. There­
     after, the Director shall, from time to time, make such
     surveys, general or local, as the conference shall deem
     expedient. In the course of such surveys, the Director
     shall give consideration to suggestions from any inter­
     ested parties, including district judges, referees, bar
     associations, trade associations, and the like. The sur­
     veys shall be made with a view toward creating and
     maintaining a system of full-time referees. However,
     should the Director find, as a result of any such surveys,
     any area in which the employment of a full-time referee
     would not be feasible because of the small amount of
     business under this Act and the extent of the territory
     to be served, he shall also report separately thereon,
     with a statement of all the pertinent facts and data and
     his recommendations and the reasons therefor. Upon
     the completion of the initial surveys, the Director shall
     report to the district judges, the councils and the con­
     ference concerning the number of referees, their respec­
     tive territories, the amounts of their respective salaries,
     and the schedules of additional fees to be charged in
     asset, arrangement and wage-earner cases. The district
     judges shall advise their respective councils, and the
     councils shall advise the conference, in respect thereto,
     stating their recommendations and their reasons there­
     for. The conference shall determine, in the light of
     the recommendations of the Director and of the councils,
     the number of referees, full-time and part-time, to
     be appointed, the respective territories which they shall
     serve, including the regular place of office and the
     places at which courts shall be held, their respective
     salaries, and schedules of graduated additional fees
     to be charged in asset, arrangement and wage-earner
     cases, and such determinations shall become effective
     sixty days after they are promulgated by the confer­
     ence." [Italics supplied.]

   Immediately following approval of the amendatory act, the
Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts, in conformity with the directives of the statute, com­
menced his study "of conditions throughout the country as
a whole, and of local conditions, including the estimated
amount of funds available for salaries, the areas and the popu­
lations to be served, the transportation and communication
facilities, the previous types and amount of business under this
act in such areas and where such business is centered, the exist­
ing personnel, and any other material factors". The surveys
were conducted under the general supervision of the Director,
and under the direct supervision of Mr. Edwin L. Covey, Chief,
Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office.
   During the course of the survey, data were gathered from
every knownsource ; reports of the various Attorneys General's
Committees, with supporting data, were reviewed and ana­
lyzed; semi-annual reports of referees, reports of private or­
ganizations, and the bankruptcy files of the Administrative
office were scrutinized. Compilation and cataloguing of these
statistical data, district by district, dating from July 1, 1936
to the time of the survey resulted in there being made avail­
                                                                      c
able, in convenient form, comprehensive information covering
every district in the country. Included in the information set
forth in these compilations were the following:
         1. The number of cases pending at the beginning of
       each fiscal year, the number of cases filed, the number
       of cases closed and the number pending at the close of
       each year from July 1, 1936 to June 30, 1946. During
       this ten-year period the total number of cases closed
       annually was broken down to show separately the num­
       ber of each type of case closed, that is asset cases, nomi­
       nal and no asset cases, section 75 and chapter cases.
       Similar compilations by types of cases were made to
       show the annuaL realizations in asset and nominal asset
       cases and the amounts paid or to be paid in the various
       chapter cases. In addition, yearly averages during the
       ten year period were computed, showing the various
       types of cases filed and closed, and the realizations or the
       amounts paid or to be paid in each type of case. From
                                                                      ­

the above information an estimate of the average an­
nual earnings for the district during the ten-year period
was compiled.
  2. The number of bankruptcy cases commenced. term­
inated and pending during each of the five fiscal years
commencing July 1, 1941 and ending June 30 1946. This
information was broken down by types of cases show­
ing separately the number of such cases in straight bank­
ruptcy and under section 75 (farmer-debtor), chapter
IX (municipal adjustments), section 77B and chapter
X (corporate reorganizat.ions), section 74 and chapter
XI (arrangements), chapter XII (real estate arrange­
ments), chapter XIII (wage-earner plans), and section
77 and chapter XV (railroad reorganizations). A yearly
average for this five-year period was computed for each
type of case.
  3. The number of asset, nominal asset and no asset
cases and the amount of gross assets realized in each
year in straight bankruptcy cases terminated during
the five year period commencing July 1, 1941 and end­
ing June 30, 1946; the amounts paid or to be paid in ar­
rangement and chapter cases terminated each year dur­
ing the same five-year period; and the yearly average
of such cases, showing the volume of each type of case
in totals and percentages for each district.
  4. Personnel data for all referees in an appointment
status on July 1, 1946, showing the official headquarters,
age, number of years in service and territory served by
each referee.
   5. The number of asset, nominal and no asset cases
handled by each referee (including his predecessor in
the same territory, if any), and the proceeds realized
in each type of case during each fiscal year, commencing
July 1, 1941 and ending June 30, 1946. The yearly av­
erage total and percentage of all types of cases handled
by each referee in each district ,vas also compiled. This
information was pa.rticularly helpful in determining
where the bankruptcy business in the district is centered.
   6. The annual earnings of each referee as reported in
the semi-annual reports showing separately by years
                                12

       the closing fees, claim fees, commISSIOns and special
        master fees received during the five-year period from
       July 1, 1941 to June 30, 1946. The total earnings of
        all referees in each district were also compiled by years
       so as to show the total income reported from all of the
       bankruptcy business in the district during each year.
       The yearly average earnings of each referee were com­
       puted as well as the yearly average total income of all
       the referees in the district.
           7. The amount of indemnity or expense moneys re,
        ceived annually by each referee during the five fiscal
       years mentioned above. From this the yearly average
       amount of expense money received in the district was
        computed.
           8. Colored maps of each district showing the terri­
        tories served by referees in office July 1, 1946, for use in
       studying possible consolidations, physical characteris­
        tics of the districts, distances and similar matters, were
       prepared.
   On August 5, 1946, Mr. Covey, under whose direct super­
                                                                       e
vision the surveys were being conducted, and Mr. Whitehurst,
Asst. Director of the Administrative Office, met with the Con­
ference Committee on Bankruptcy Administration in Denver,
Colorado. This meeting was for the purpose of reporting on
the progress of the statistical part of the surveys; permitting
a review of the data being assembled in order that a determina­
tion as to their sufficiency might be made, and for the consider­
ation of the proposed program for the completion of the survey.
   The Committee was of the opinion that satisfactory progress
had been made and that the information which was being as­
sembled was, except for a few minor additions, adequate and
met the requirements of the statute. The Committee suggested
that as the information was compiled for each district it be
presented by representatives of the Administrative Office to as
many district judges and referees as possible in order that local
conditions might be studied at first hand and the data could be
fully discussed with the district judges and others interested in
bankruptcy matters.                                                    -

       A progress report by the Conference Committee was given

-   to the Conference at its regularsessio'n in Octo'Qer, 1946. The
    Conference, at this time, indicated satisfaction with the prog:­
    ress that had been made and the manner and method in which
    the survey was being conducted. The Conference also agreed
    to the calling of a special session of the Conference some time
    during the Spring of 1947, probably in April, for the purpose
    of reviewing the Director's recommendations and,otherwise,
    complying with the directives of the statute insofar as Con~
    ference action was required.
       Following the August meeting with the Conference Com­
    mittee in Denver, upon completion of the compilation of data
    for a particular district, the survey Director, or an:)presenta­
    tive from his staff, visited the district and conferred with the
    district judge and others interested in the matter. With the
    exception of the districts of North Dakota, South Dakota, New
    Mexico, and the Western District of North Carolina, every dis­
    trict in the country was visited (excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and
    Puerto Rico). These conferences, which extended through
    January 1947, afforded,an opportunity for the data so assembled
    to be considered both by the district judges, and by the survey
    staff itself, in the light of current and prospective local condi­
    tions and needs in the districts; the recommendations and sug­
    gestions of the individuals visited were recorded and made part
    and parcel of the survey.
       As these conferences were completed, the survey Director and
    his staff reviewed their determinations in th~ liglltof. th:e addi­
    tional information they had secured, giving consideration to
    the recommendations and suggestions of those visited. Advis­
    able revisions and modifications of previous conclusions were
    made.
       Thereupon, the Survey Director submitted his report
    and recommendations to the Director of the Administrative
    Office. The report showed the nature of the data which had
    been considered in the conclusions reached. It contained
    specific statements of the reasons for providing for part-time
    referees in those districts in which part-time rather than full­
    time referees were recommended. It showed in a schedule the
                                14 

recommended number, full-time or part-time, salary, regular
place of office, places of holding court, and territory for the
referees of each district, and, also, contained recommendations
for fees and charges to parties in bankruptcy proceedings re­
quired by the amendatory act to be determined by the Judicial
Conference of Senior Circuit Judges.
  Whereupon, the Director of the Administrative Office, in
compliance with the provisions of the amendatory act, made
his recommendations and, under date of March 17, 1947, sub­
mitted them to the District Judges, the Circuit Councils, and
the Judicial Conference. In his letter of transmittal, the
Director stated, in part, as follows:
           The survey has been made under the direct charge
       of Mr. Edwin L. Covey, Chief of the Bankruptcy Divi­
       sion, and he has written the succeeding report. But he
       has conferred with me constantly as the work has pro­
       gressed and I have followed it closely at all times. I
       have carefully considered the report and approve and
       adopt it.
           The report represents the best judgment of the Ad­
       ministrative Office formed after prolonged and inten­
        sive study. We have especially endeavored to allo­
       cate the total funds recommended for salaries and ex­
        penses of referees uniformly among the different dis­
        tricts in relation to their particular needs. We believe
        that the resulting plan is as fair and equitable as can
       reasonably be devised.
           We shall appreciate it if in accordance with the statute
        the district judges will submit their advice and recom­
       mendations in regard to the plan as soon as reasonably
        may be to the judicial councils of their respective cir­
        cuits, in order that the 1atter in turn may be in a position
        to advise the Judicial Conference. We shall also be glad
        to consider any criticisms or suggestions and bring them
        to the attention of the committee of the Judicial Con­




                                                                       -

                 ference on the bankruptcy administration and of the
                 Judicial Conference. If the plan can be improved we
                 want to see it done.
            On the following day, the Chief Justice issued a call for this
         special session of the Conference and suggested to the members
         of the Judicial Conference, who are the Chairmen of the judicial
         councils in their respective circuits, that they take steps to
         have the recommendations of the district judges submitted t<J
         them early enough to permit full consideration and action by
         their circuit councils prior to the meeting of the Judicial Con­
         ference. It was also stated that it would be helpful if they
         would send copies of any recommendations of their respective
         judicial councils to Mr. Covey on or before April 14, 1947, in
         order that they might be brought to the attention of the Bank­
         ruptcy Committee of the Conference at a meeting to be held
         immediately preceding the meeting of the Conference.
            The Committee of the Judicial Conference on Bankruptcy
         Administration met at Washington. D. C., on April 18th and
         19th, 1947, with the approval of the Chief Justice of the United
         States, for the purpose of considering the Director's report and
         recommendations with relation to the initial surveys of bank­
         ruptcy administration required under the amendatory act.
           All of the statistical information and other data upon which
         the determinations of the Director were based were made avail­
         able to and considered by the Committee. Reports of the vari­
         ous circuit councils and district judges were also considered. It
         was the sense of the Committee that where no word had been
         received from the Circuit Councils or from District Courts, it
         could be taken as an indication that no objection would be made
         to the Director's recommendations. 'Vhereupon, the Commit­
         tee proceeded to make its determinations and recommendations
         which are incorporated in its formal report to the Conference
         dated April 21, 1947.
                               16 

   The report and recommendations of the Conference Com­
mittee were submitted through its Chairman, Judge Orie L.
Phillips. A general summarization of the Committee's work,
concerning the subject matter; since its inception in 1942
was had.
   In addition to the report of the Director, which had pre­
viously been presented to the Conference, the Conference had
brought before it all the data assembled and secured by the
survey staff; and a composite compilation of the recommenda­
tions of the circuit councils, the district judges, the Director,
and the Conference Committee. The Chief Justice presented
the following communications relating to the Ninth Judicial
Circuit:
          Letter dated April 17, 1947, from William Denman,
       U. S. Circuit Judge, San Francisco, to the Chief Justice.
          Statement of Judge Denman Hrelative to Referees in
       Bankruptcy, Northern District of California," dated
       April 17, 1941.
          Letters to Senior Circuit Judge Francis A. Garrecht
       from the following District Judges: 

          Campbell E. Beaumont, Fresno, Calif. 

          Lloyd L. Black, Seattle, Wash. 

          John C. Bowen, Seattle, Wash. 

          Chase A. Clark, Boise, Idaho. 

          J. Frank McLaughlin, Honolulu, T. H. 

          Paul J. McCormick, Los Angeles, Calif. 

          Charles M. Pray, Great Falls, Mont. 

          Letters from Phil Cass and J. Donovan Flint, Referees, 

       Honolulu, T. H., to District Judges J. Frank McLaughlin
       and D. E. Metzger, Honolulu, T. H.
  The Conference then entered upon a general discussion con­
cerning the manner and method in which the surveys were con­
ducted; the source of the data collected and its relationship to
present-day situations; and, the manner and method of weigh­
ing, assembling and cataloguing the data secured.
                                17 

   It "laS called to the attention of the Conference that in some
instances the "regular place of office" was not fixed by either the
Director or the Committee of the Conference, and that alternate
sites were recommended. It was the sense of the Conference
that the provisions of the statute required it to definitely fix the
"regular place of office" and that this contemplates one particu­
lar location.
   Thereupon, the conference proceeded to consider the prob­
lems incident to the proposals and the program district by dis­
trict and circuit by circuit, and with respect to "the number
of referees, full-time and part-time, to be appointed, the respec­
tive territories which they shall serve, including the regular
place of office and the places at which courts shan be held, their
respective salaries, and schedules of graduated additional fees
to be charged in asset, arrangement and wage-earner cases,"
made the following determinations as required by Section 37b
 (1) of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by Section 4 of the
amendatory act:

further ordered that the issuance of this report of the Confer­
ence constitute such promulgation.
   Pursuant to Section 40 c (3) of the Bankruptcy Act, as
amended, the Director recommended and upon a favorable
report by the Bankruptcy Committee, the Conference ap­
proved the following charges for special services relating to or
in connection with proceedings before referees:

tion of an arrangement, or plan, $10 to be paid by the objecting
creditor provided that no such charge shall be made for filing
objections to a discharge by the United States Attorney.
Where objections to a discharge are filed by the trustee, the
                                 41 

charge shall be paid from the estate of the bankrupt unless
waived by the court.
   3. For filing petitions for review and for filing petitions for
reclamation of property, $10 for each petition filed, to be paid

The charge shall be paid from the estate of the bankrupt or

and the proceeds shall be transmitted to the clerk for deposit

   Pursuant to Section 40c (2) of the Bankruptcy Act as
amended, the following rules and regulations prescribing the
methods for determining the net proceeds realized in asset
cases, fair values of considerations, other than money distribu­
table in arrangement cases, and payments actually made by or
for a debtor under the plan in wage-earner cases, were recom­
mended by the Director and, upon a favorable report by the
Bankruptcy Committee, were approved by the Conference:
   1. Determination of net proceeds realized.
   In determining the amount of net proceeds realized in asset
cases for the purpose of Section 40c (2) of the Bankruptcy
Act as amended, the term "net proceeds realized in asset cases"
shall mean, in the case of sale or liquidation, the amount of
money coming into the estate of a bankrupt as assets of such
estate or, if not sold or liquidated the fair cash market value
                              42
                                                                    ~
of all property corning into the estate as assets of such estate,   "
exclusive of all statutory exemptions whether State or Federal      .'fIIi
and exclusive of all expenses directly incurred in the operation
of the debtor's business after bankruptcy; Provided, however,
that where property is sold or transferred subject to a valid
existing mortgage, lien or other encumbrance, the amount of
such mortgage, lien or other encumbrance not affected by such
sale shall not be included in determining the amount of net
proceeds realized.
   2. Determination of fair values of considerations, other than
money, distributable in arrangement cases.
   In determining the fair values of considerations, other than
money, distributable in arrangement cases, for the purposes
of Section 40c (2) of the Bankruptcy Act as amended, the term
"fair values of considerations" shall mean either (a) the value
fixed in the arrangement or (b) if not so fixed, the value de­
termined by the court in the order confirming the arrange­
ment.
   3. Determination of payments actually made by or for a
debtor under the plan in wage-earner cases.
   In determining the amount of payments actually made by
or for the debtor under a plan in wage-earner cases, for the
purposes of Section 40c (2) of the Bankruptcy Act as amended,
only the amounts actually paid by or for the debtor for the
benefit of creditors under the plan shall be taken into account.
   4. Upon the determination of the amounts to be charged
against individual estates pursuant to the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Act and these rules, the court shall enter an order
setting forth the amount and character of such charges and
ordering the trustee or debtor in possession to pay such
amounts forthwith to the clerk of the court for transmission to
the Treasury of the United States for credit to the referees'
salary and referees' expense funds, respectively.
   The Director recommended that the salary and promotional
plan and the annual and sick leave policy presently operative
for employees of the courts be extended to full-time employees
in referees' offices. This recommendation was approved by the
Bankruptcy Committee and adopted by the Judicial Confer­
ence.
-                                   43
       The provisions of H. R. 1810 (80th Cong.) designed to re­
    move the disqualification of part-time referees to practice be­
    lore certain government agencies were brought to the attention
    of the Conference. The matter was passed over without action.
        Court Reporters.-The report and recornmendations of the
    Committee on the Court Reporting System were submitted to,
    and considered by, the Conference.
        Since the October 1946 session of the Conference, the com­
    mittee has considered data regarding the reporting arrange­
    ments and the earnings of reporters in each district assembled
    for it by the Administrative Office. Representatives of a com­
    mittee on legislation and regulations of the Conference of
    United States Court Reporters appeared before the committee
    and presented the general views of the Federal court reporters
    in regard to various features of the court reporting system.
        The committee, pursuant to instructions of the Conference,
    gave its primary attention to the compensation of reporters
    under the present system. Comparable earnings for the fiscal
    year 1946, and the first half of the fiscal year 1947 were care­
    fully studied, and requests for increases in salary and transcript
    rates in particular districts were considered in the light of these
    earnl11gs.
        The Conference agreed with the committee's conclusions that
     the present scale of salaries, ranging from $3,000 a year, the
     minimum under the Court Reporter Act, for positions in general
     in rural districts where the reporting work is light, to $5,000 for
     positions generally in the metropolitan districts where practi­
     ('ally the full time of the reporters must be devoted to their
     official duties, should be maintained.
        It also agreed with the committee that changes in the present
     classification of positions to increase the salaries in any particu­
     lar district should be made only upon a positive showing of a
     change in the circumstances which led to the initial classifica­
     tion of the positions, such as increases in work-load, or a dis­
     closure of some compelling circumstance overlooked when the
     position was originally classified resulting in an inequitable sit­
     uation in comparison ,,,ith others.
        In conformity with this policy, and on the basis of the
                                44 

information before it, the Conference approved the committee's
recommendations of the following specific changes in salaries
for court reporters:
   For the District of Massachusetts: The salaries of the two
authorized reporters now paid at the rate of $4,500 to be in­
creased to $5,000 so that each of the four authorized reporters
will receive that salary.
   For the District of Maryland: The salaries of the two au­
thorized reporters to be increased from $4,000 to $5,000.
   For the Eastern District of Louisiana: The salaries of the
two authorized reporters to be increased from $3,600 to $4,000.
   The Conference directed that these increases be made effec­
tive if and when the monies necessary to defray the expense in­
cident thereto are appropriated by the Congress, and the Di­
rector was instructed to submit, in the usual way and at the
first favorable opportunity, an estimate for the requisite in­
creased appropriation to the Congress.
   The committee's recommendation that the requests for in­
creases in reporters' salaries in the following districts be denied,
was approved by the Conference:
      The Middle District of North Carolina,
      The Western District of Virginia,
      The Northern District of West Virginia,
      The Northern District of Alabama,
      The Northern District of Texas,
      The District of the Canal Zone,
      The Southern District of Ohio,
      The Middle District of Tennessee,
      The Western District of Tennessee,
      The Eastern District of Oklahoma.
   Upon recommendation of the committee, the Conference
deferred for further investigation requests for increases in the
salaries of the reporters for the Southern District of Iowa and
the Third Division of the District of Alaska.
   The Conference adopted the committee's recommendations
that the present transcript rates should be maintained, and
that no increase in excess of 40 cents for the original and 15
cents for copies should be approved in the absence of a showing
of unusual circumstances which indicate that the present rate
                                                    45 

     is resulting in real hardship to the reporter; and that requests
     for higher rates than those now in effect should not be con­
     sidered, under the provisions of the Court Reporter Act, un­
     less it has been determined in advance that the proposed rate
     is desired by the judge of the district concerned.
        The Conference, thereupon, approved and authorized the
     following increases in transcript rates, to become effective on
     June 1, 1947:

        The increase in rates in Hawaii was authorized in response
     to the request of the District Court for a change in the present
     reporting arrangement, approved at the October 1946 Con­
     ference, whereby, as a condition of the increase in salary, it
     was specified that the vacancy in the second authorized regular
     reporter's position should remain unfilled. In this connection,
     the Conference also approved the Committee's recommenda­
     tion that the court be authorized to employ temporary re­
     porters at the per diem rate for attendance currently paid in

     such an extent as may be required to supply necessary report­
     ing services for the court when both of its judges are conduct­
     ing proceedings simultaneously.
