     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF
                            PENNSYLVANIA

  At the special session held March 26, 27, 1953, the Conference
recommended the creation of two additional judgeships for the
Western District of Pennsylvania, with a proviso that the first
vacancy occurring in this district should not be filled. (Rept. p. 4.)
                                    (3)
                                  4


The temporary judgeship was recommended because of the serious          .,
illness of one of the judges of that district. This judge has since     .,
died. Upon re-examination of the situation in the light of this
changed condition the Conference was of the opinion that the tem­
porary judgeship is nevertheless still needed and reaffirmed its
previous recommendation.

RULES ADOPTED BY COURTS OF ApPEALS FOR REVIEW OR ENFORCE­
          MENTOF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

   Section 11 of Public Law 901 of the Slst Congress (64 Stat. 1132,
5 U. S. C. Supp. V § 1041) provides for the adoption, subject to the
approval of the Judicial Conference, of rules covering the practice
and procedure in proceedings to review or enforce orders of certain
administrative agencies.
   The Conference approved rules adopted pursuant to this pro­
vision by the Courts of Appeals for the Seventh and Ninth Circuits.
The Conference also approved amendments adopted by the Court
of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit, of a rule heretofore
adopted by that court and approved by the Conference at its Sep­
tember 1952 session (Rept., p. 23).

A BILL   To   PROHIBIT THE IMPOSITION OF CONCURRENT SENTENCES
                                                                        ,
   The Director of the Administrative Office informed the Confer­
ence that the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representa­
tives had requested an expression of views with regard to a bill
 (H. R. 4315) entitled "A bill to prohibit the imposition of con­
current sentences in certain cases." The bill provides that no
sentence of imprisonment imposed for a violation of Title 18 of the
United States Code, which is the Federal Criminal Code, shall be
served concurrently with another sentence of imprisonment im­
posed for a violation of that title. It further provides that no sen­
tence of imprisonment imposed by the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia or the Municipal Court of the District
of Columbia for violation of any law which relates solely to the
District of Columbia shall be served concurrently with another
sentence of imprisonment imposed for a violation of such a pro>­
vision or of Title 18 of the United States Code.
   The Conference, after consideration, disapproved the proposed
legislation.                                                            _l~'

                MAINTENANCE EXPENSES OF JUDGES

  Judge Phillips, chairman, presented a report of the committee
appointed to study maintenance expenses of judges under section
456 of Title 28, United States Code, pursuant to the resolution of
the Conference at its special session of March 26, 27, 1953 (Rept.,
p.13).
  After consideration the Conference approved the report as sub­
mitted. Judge Major did not vote on the adoption of the report.
Copies were directed to be transmitted to the Congress and to
the General Accounting Office.
  The report is as follows:
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON MAINTENANCE EXPENSES OF JUDGES

To the Chief Justice of the United States, Chairman, and the
    Members of the Judicial Conference of the United States:
                       PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

   At the Special Meeting of the Judicial Conference of the United
States held March 26 and 27, 1953, the Director of the Administra­
tive Office of the United States Courts brought to the attention of
the Conference that at a hearing before a subcommittee of the
Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives,
and later at a hearing before a subcommittee of the Senate Com­
mittee on the Judiciary, questions had been raised with respect to
expense accounts for maintenance certified by certain circuit
judges, that a bill had been introduced in Congress to amend
Title 28, U. S. C., Section 456, and that members of such sub­
committees had informally requested the Judicial Conference to
give consideration to these matters.
   The Director furnished to the Judicial Conference a statement
of payments for maintenance expenses to the circuit judges for the
calendar years 1951 and 1952, and to district judges for the first
8 months of the current fiscal year, and certain statements received
by him with respect to the residence and official station of 2 cir­
cuit judges.
   After consideration and discussion the Judicial Conference
adopted the following resolution:
  That the Chief Justice appoint a committee of five to make a comprehensive
study of Section 456, Title 28, United States Code, of the practices that have
obtained thereunder and the administrative constructions that have been placed
                                        6

thereon; that the committee proceed as expeditiously as possible to make such         •
study, and report back to a special meeting of this Conference the results of its     ..
study and its recommendations; and that the action of the Conference on the
report and such recommendations as the Conference deems appropriate shall be
transmitted to the Congress.

  Whereupon the Chief Justice appointed and constituted your
Committee pursuant to such resolution.
  Your Committee held meetings at Washington on April 6 and
in Chicago on April 23 and 24, 1953. The Administrative Office
furnished to each member of the Committee the legislative history
of section 259 infra and records of administrative constructions
thereof and other relevant material, which members of the Com­
mittee studied and considered at and in the interval between its
meetings.
                            LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

   While as far back as 1850 certain statutes made special provi­
sion for the payment of travel and maintenance expenses of circuit
and district judges under certain circumstances, Section 259 of
the Judicial Code of 1911 (Act of Mar. 3,1911,36 Stat., page 1161)
for the first time made general provision for the payment of travel
and maintenance expenses of circuit and district judges while away                    t

from their official residence in the performance of official business.
   The earlier acts referred to above are set forth in appendix I
to this report.
   Section 259 Impra reads as follows:
  SEC. 259. The circuit justices, the circuit and district judges of the United
States, and the judges of the district courts of the United States in Alaska,
Hawaii, and Porto Rico, shall each be allowed and paid his necessary expenses
of travel, and his reasonable expenses (not to exceed $10 per day) actually
incurred for maintenance, consequent upon his attending court or transacting
other official business in pursuance of law at any place other than his official
place of residence, said expenses to be paid by the marshal of the district in
which such court is held or official business transacted, upon the written certifi­
cate of the justice or judge. The official place of residence of each circuit and
district judge, and of each judge of the district courts of the United States in
Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, shall be at that place nearest his actual residence
at which either a circuit court of appeals or a district court is regularly held.
Each such judge shall, npon his appointment, and from time to time thereafter
whenever he may change his official residence, in writing notify the Department
of Justice of his official place of residence.
  Section 259 Impra was carried into the 1924 edition of the United
States Code in Title 28, Section 374, and in subsequent editions
of the United States Code up to and including 1946 without sub­                       _.:
stantial change.
                                        7

  In 1932 the Comptroller General of the United States ruled that
Section 259 supra was in effect repealed by the Economy Act of
that year.
  Section 259 was reenacted without substantial change by the
Act of April 22, 1940, 54 Stat. 149. It was carried into the 1948
revision of Title 28, USC, as section 456 which reads:
   § 456. Traveling expenses of Justices and Judges.
  Each justice or judge of the United States and each retired justice or judge
recalled or designated and aSsigned to active duty, shall, upon his certificate,
be paid by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
all necessary traveling expenses and also his reasonable maintenance expenses
actually incurred, not exceeding $10 per day, while attending court or trans­
acting official business at a place other than his official station.
   The official station of the Chief Justice of the United States, the justices of
the Supreme Court and the judges of the Court of Claims, the Court of Customs
and Patent Appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia,
shall be the District of Columbia.
   The official station of the judges of the Customs Court shall be New York City.
   The official station of each circuit and district judge, including each district
judge in the Territories and Possessions, shall be that place nearest his residence
at which a district court is regularly held.
   Each circuit judge and each district judge whose official station is not fixed
expressly herein shall upon his appointment and from time to time thereafter,
as his residence lllay change, notify the Director of the Administrative Office
of the United States Courts in writing of his residence and official station.

  The legislative history of section 259, as it appeared in the
Judicial Code of 1911, throws little or no light on the construction
to be placed on the phrase "actual residence" as used in that
section. We have summarized such legislative history in an at­
tachment to appendix I of this report.
                      ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRUCTION

                                  Evans Case
  In 1933 the Department of Justice questioned the accounts for
maintenance expense at Chicago, Ill., certified by Circuit Judge
Evan A. Evans, on the ground he was an actual resident of Chicago
and, therefore, his official residence was in Chicago and not at Madi­
son, Wis., which he had designated as his official residence.
  It appeared that during a period from October 1931 until July
1933, Judge Evans had been continuously in Chicago and had been
paid for that entire period the maximum allowance for subsistence
except for a few weeks in August and September 1932. In re­
sponse to questions as to whether, in view of his continuous pres­
      2:)4711-53--2
                                  8


ence in Chicago, that city was not his actual residence within
the meaning of the statute, Judge Evans said that he maintained           ~. 

his home at Baraboo, Wis., where he lived when he was appointed
to the Court of Appeals; that he voted and paid property and
income taxes there; that his family regarded it as his home and
that he intended to return there when he retired. On this account,
he had designated Madison, the nearest place to Baraboo where a
district court is held, as his official residence under the statute.
He said that his Chicago quarters were only a small furnished
apartment where he and Mrs. Evans stayed during their neces­
sary presence in Chicago for the work of the Court of Appeals.
He urged that under the statute the judge is the one to make the
selection, and to change it if he wishes.
   After considerable study, the Department of Justice informed
Judge Evans that it had concluded to adhere to its position that
he was not entitled to draw per diem while attending court or
performing other official duties in Chicago. This conclusion was
based upon a Departmental memorandum by Alexander Holtzoff
 (then a special assistant to the Attorney General), which con­
cluded that a judge may not arbitrarily name a place as his actual
residence, that this is a question of fact and that in this situation     t

it was his view that Judge Evans actually resided in Chicago and
not in Baraboo.
   In October 1934, Judge Evans asked that the matter be reviewed,
but the Department adhered to its original position and so informed
 the Judge.
   In October 1936, Judge Evans again reopened the matter with
 the then assistant to the Attorney GeneraL The Department of
 Justice again reexamined its position and concluded by telling
 Judge Evans that if he would write the Attorney General stating
 where he desired his headquarters fixed, and advising of his place
of residence, and would certify these designations, the information
so furnished would be carried on the Department records and
instructions would be issued immediately in accordance therewith.
 Such a statement was promptly furnished by Judge Evans, re­
 asserting actual residence in Baraboo throughout his entire tenure
 of judicial office and so requesting that his home there be recorded
 as his actual residence, and Madison, Wis., as his official residence.
 Accordingly, the Department instructed the United States Marshal
 at Chicago to resume payment of maintenance expenses to Judge            t,:!
 Evans on that basis after December 1, 1936.
                                 9

   Later, in 1939, in a departmental memorandum, the administra­
tive assistant to the Attorney General stated that this action was
based upon the statutory provision which permits the judge to
designate and change his official residence, and indicating that in
view of this, there appeared no alternative for the Department
than to follow this policy until the ambiguities of the law should
be cleared up by legislation.
   A more detailed statement with respect to this matter is set forth
in appendix II attached to this report.
                          Buffington Case
   In January 1933 the United States Marshal for the Eastern Dis­
trict of Pennsylvania asked instructions of the Department of
Justice with respect to the payment of maintenance expenses at
Philadelphia to Circuit Judge Joseph Buffington, who had desig­
nated Pittsburgh as his official residence.
   Judge Buffington apparently for some time prior to January 1933
had only a legal domicile in Pittsburgh and actually lived in Phila­
delphia. The Department of Justice ruled that Judge Buffington
was not entitled to maintenance at Philadelphia. Judge Buffing­
ton acquiesced in such ruling. In May 1934, Judge Buffington
advised the Department of Justice that his wife had passed away
and that he would henceforth make Pittsburgh unquestionably his
actual residence. Whereupon the Department of Justice instructed
the Marshal to resume maintenance payments on the basis of the
official residence of Judge Buffing;ton at Pittsburgh.
   The administrative rulings in the Buffington case are set forth
more fully in appendix II attached hereto.
                            Jenney Case
  Judge Ralph E. Jenney was appointed United States District
Judge for the Southern District of California on July 3,1937.
  In June 1940 the Acting Comptroller General of the United
States took up with the Director of the Administrative Office of
the United States Courts the question of the allowance of main­
tenance expenses to Judge Jenney at Los Angeles.
  At the time of his appointment Judge Jenney owned and main­
tained an actual residence at San Diego, Calif., and he had desig­
nated San Diego as his actual and official residence. The
Comptrol1er General pointed out that in a period of 17 months,
                                        10 


from July 31, 1938, through November 30, 1939, Judge Jenney
spent 395 days in performing his judicial duties in Los Angeles and
was in attendance at San Diego 111 days.
   The Director of the Administrative Office presented these facts
to the Judicial Conference of the United States at its regular an­
nual session in October 1940. After consideration of the problem,
the Judicial Conference adopted the following resolution:
   With respect to reimbursement for traveling and subsistence expenses incurred
while attending court or transacting other official business at any place
other than a judge's official place of residence, as provided by section 259 of the
.Judicial Code (U. S. Code, Title 28, § 374), which defines "official place of resi­
dence" as "that place nearest his actual residence at which either a Circuit
Court of Appeals or a District Court is regularly held," it was declared to be
the sense of the Conference that mere legal domicile is not sufficient to satisfy
the words of the statute, "actual residence."
 . Later, Judge Jenney listed his home at San Diego for sale and
established living quarters at Pasadena. Correspondence ensued
between the Director and Judge Jenney, resulting in an agreement
that thereafter Pasadena should be designated as his actual resi­
dence and Los Angeles as his official residence.
   Further details with respect to the Jenney case are set forth in
appendix II attached to this report .

  At the meeting of the Judicial Conference in 1952 the Director
informed the Conference that at the request of Representatives
Hi11ings of California and Budge of Idaho data conceming the
maintenance expenses paid to an circuit judges in the calendar
year 1951 had been fumished to these Representatives. The
Director stated in this connection that the charges for maintenance
of certain circuit judges in the Ninth Circuit had been specifically
questioned. The Judicial Conference, after informal discussion of
the matter, requested the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit to have
the matter considered by the Judicial Council of his circuit.
  Further facts with respect to this matter are set forth in appendix
II attached to this report.

                         PRACTICES UNDER THE ACT

  Your committee has made an exhaustive study of practices
under the act and has concluded that, with few exceptions, charges
made for maintenance by judges have been clearly within both the                       ._:)}
letter and spirit of section 456. Our studies specifically included
                                 11 

recent maintenance payments to all circuit and district judges
which involved substantial amounts.
   Disagreement has arisen from time to time with respect to the
proper construction of the phrase "actual residence" and the term
"residence" in section 259 and section 456, respectively.
   At least one judge, and perhaps others, have contended that
mere technical residence or bare legal domicile without an actual
place of abode comes within the phrase "actual residence" or the
term Itresidence."
   Other judges have contended that if they maintain a home at a
place designated by them as "actual residence" or "residence" it
comes within the meaning of sections 259 and 456 notwithstanding
they maintain living quarters a,t places where their courts are
regularly held and live for long periods of time at such living
quarters.
   Other judges have designated as their "actual residence" or
"residence" the place where they maintain an actual place of abode
~nd where they customarily live except for periods when they are
away from such place in the performance of official duties, and to
which theyregularly return on the completion of sessions of court
at other places in their districts or circuits. In such cases the
time which the judge spends away from his designated place of
residence is generally less than the time he lives in his place of
abode.
   The charges made for maintenance by the judges referred to in
the following paragraphs have been questioned.
   Circuit Judge WILLIAM HEALY was appointed United States Cir­
cuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit on June 21, 1937. Prior to his
appointment he owned and maintained a home at Boise, Idaho,
in which he and his family lived. Approximately 2 years before
his appointment he sold such home. Since his appointment he has
not had, or maintained, a home or place of abode of any kind at
Boise, Idaho, except during the early part of his tenure when he
spent some time in the summer or early autumn at the Hotel
Boise or the Wellman Apartments in Boise. Except for rela­
tively short periods during which he has sat in sessions of the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit at Los Angeles, Portland, and
Seattle, and the district court at various court towns in Idaho, he
has lived in a hotel or rented apartment in San Francisco. Judge
Healy votes at Boise and pays income taxes in Idaho. He main­
r                                    12 

    tains he has always had the animus revertendi with respect to a
    Boise home and that this with the above facts brings him within
                                                                            e
    section 456. H~. cites in support of that position the Supreme
    Court decision of District of Columbia v. Murphy, 314 U. S. 441.
        Continuously since his appointment Judge Healy has designated
    Boise as his place of residence and official station and has claimed
    and been paid his maintenance expenses at San Francisco. It
    would seem to your committee that such designation is predicated
    solely on a legal domicile at Boise. The Conference ruled in 1940
    that mere legal domicile is not sufficient to satisfy the statute and
    we recommend that this construction be adhered to with respect
    to pending or future claims of Judge Healy for maintenance at
    San Francisco.
        Detailed facts with respect to the residence of Judge Healy are
    set forth in communications and statements furnished by him to
    your committee which appear in appendix III attached to this
    report.
        Circuit Judge WALTER L. POPE was appointed United States
    Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit on March 1, 1949. At the
    time of his appointment he owned a large house, situated a short
    distance from Missoula, Mont., which he and his family regularly        (;J
    occupied as a home. Since his appointment he has continued to
     own and maintain tha.t home fully furnished and available for
     occupancy by him at any time he chooses to go to Missoula.
       . For some time past he has lived in a medium-sized rented home
     situated near San Francisco, Calif. The rental on this rented
    home is $2,424 per annum. It was fully furnished by Judge Pope
     at a cost of $7,000. During approximately 2% months of the
     summer season in each year Judge Pope returns with his family
     to Missoula. During those periods Judge Pope lives in his Mis­
    soula home and occupies District Judge Murray's chambers in
    Missoula, and engages in the writing of opinions and the perform­
     ance of other judicial duties.
         Upon his appointment Judge Pope designated Missoula as his
     place of actual residence and his official station. He has certified
     and has been paid expenses for maintenance at San Francisco,
     except during the periods he spends during the summer months
     at Missoula and except for relatively short periods when he has
     sat in the Court of Appeals at Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles,
                                                                            " ..\11

   The detailed facts with respect to Judge Pope are set forth in
letters and statements furnished by him to the committee, copies
of which are attached hereto as appendix IV.
   Chief Judge J. EARL MAJOR was appointed United States Circuit
Judge for the Seventh Circuit on March 23, 1937. At the time of
his appointment he owned and maintained a substantial and fully
furnished eight-room home at Hillsboro, Ill. He and his family
have occupied that home, except for periods of time when he has
lived in a rented apartment at Chicago, IlL For some time past
it has been the practice of Judge Major to remain at Chicago the
major portion of the period from the opening of the fall term of
the Court of Appeals in September until the summer recess of
the Court. He has, however, from time to time during those
periods returned to Hillsboro. Judge Major designated Spring­
field, the court town nearest Hillsboro, as his official station and
has claimed and been paid his maintenance expenses while in
Chicago. Judge Major is now engaged in the construction of a
new home at Hillsboro, which he will furnish and occupy when it
is completed. He has given notice of cancellation on his leased
apartment in Chicago, and has advised the committee that in
 the future he will spend substantially less time at Chicago and
return to Hillsboro between sessions of the Court for the writing
 of opinions and the performance of other judicial work.
    The facts with respect to Judge Major are more fully set forth
 in letters and statements furnished by him to the committee, copies
 of which are attached hereto as appendix V.
    Circuit Judge H. NATHAN SWAIM was appointed as a United
 States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit on October 21, 1949.
 At that time he owned a large home situated in Indianapolis, Ind.,
 which he and his wife regularly occupied. Since his appointment
 he has continued to maintain that home and to live there except
 during periods of time when he has lived in a small furnished
 apartment at Chicago, rented on a month-to-month basis. Cham­
 bers for Judge Swaim have not yet been provided at Indianapolis.
 However, he advises us that he has now taken steps to procure
 such chambers. Judge Swaim has lived in his rented apartment
 in Chicago during the larger portion of the time between the open­
 ing of Court in September and its adjournment for the summer
 recess. Judge Swaim designated Indianapolis as his official sta­
 tion and has claimed and been allowed his maintenance expenses
 when in Chicago. Judge Swaim advises us that he plans in the
                                 14 

future, as soon as chambers are available in Indianapolis, to spend     •
substantially more time at Indianapolis and there engage in the         We
writing of opinions and the performance of other judicial work
between court sessions at Chicago.
   The facts with respect to Judge Swaim are set forth in letters
and statements furnished by him to your committee, which are
attached hereto as appendix VI.
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FORMER PHRASE "ACTUAL RESIDENCE"
             AND THE TERM "RESIDENCE" IN THE ACT

   The Conference at its 1940 session, as hereinbefore stated, made
an administrative ruling to the effect that "mere legal domicile
is not sufficient to satisfy the words of the statute, lactual
residence' ."
   Your committee is of the opinion that Congress in omitting the
word "actual" in section 456 from the phrase ((actual residence"
which was used in section 259, did not intend any change in the
meaning of the term "residence." Weare, therefore, of the
opinion that the 1940 ruling is applicable to section 456, and should
be adhered to.
   Your committee is of the opinion that a circuit judge who main­
tains a home at the place designated by him as his actual residence,
and who lives at that home except during periods at which he
is attending sessions of Court in his circuit or otherwise is absent
on official business, and who regularly returns to that home for
the preparation of opinions and the performance of other official
work, comes clearly within the letter and spirit of Section 456.
   It is the opinion of your committee that proper provision for
travel and maintenance expenses of judges while away from their
homes in the discharge of their official duties is of great im­
portance to the proper administration of justice in the Federal
courts. It is desirable that Federal courts, both District and
Circuit, shall be held at places which meet the convenience of liti­
gants, witnesses, and jurors, and that proper charges for mainte­
nance and travel expense should not be curtailed. We also think
it important that circuit judges, who are appointed from various
States in their circuit, should be encouraged to maintain their
homes in the State from which they are appointed in order that
they may continue to bring to the Court and the judicial councils,
of which they are members, their peculiar knowledge of local con­
ditions and local law.
                                        15 

   Your conunittee is of the opinion that the charges for main­
tenance made by Judge Major and Judge Swaim while engaged
in the performance of official duties in Chicago and Judge Pope
while engaged in the performance of official duties in San Fran­
cisco, come clearly within the final administrative ruling of the
Department of Justice in the Evans case and were properly charged
and paid. Your committee agrees that the final ruling in the
Evans case was permissible under the language of the statute, but
we are convinced that the phrase "actual residence" in the former
statute and the word "residence" in the present statute mean an
actual place of abode where the judge customarily lives. Although
a judge may maintain a home in which he spends substantial por~
tions of his vacation, if he actually lives elsewhere in living quar­
ters of substantially permanent character during the greater por­
tion of the year, we believe that the latter is his residence rather
than the former, within the spirit of the statute and that section
456 should be so construed hereafter by the Director. We think
the intent of the statute was to reimburse the judge for mainte­
Lance expenses only when performing official duties at a place
other than the place of his actual abode.
   Your conunittee is further of the opinion that the language of
the statute is ambiguous and not entirely free from doubt. This
is indicated by the varying constructions placed thereon by dif­
ferent judges, and by the administrative rulings referred to above.
   Accordingly, your committee suggests that the Judicial Confer­
ence recommend to Congress the amendment of Section 456 of the
Title 28, U. S. C., so that the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the
section will read as follows:
   The official station of each circuit and district judge, including each district
judge in the Territories and Possessions, shall be tbat place where a district court
ls regularly held and at or near which the judge performs a substantial portion
of his judicial work, which is nearest tbe place where he maintains an actual
abode in which he customarily lives.
   Each circuit judge and each district judge whose official station is not fixed
expressly in the second paragraph of this Section shall upon his appointment and
from time to time thereafter as his official station may change, notify the Director
of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in writing of his actual
abode and his official station.

  The purpose of the phrase in our proposed amendment "at or
near which the judge performs a substantial portion of his judicial
work" is to eliminate the possibility, which the present law permits,
of a judge claiming as his official station a place at or near which
      254711-53-3
                                        16
he performs no substantial judicial work. It is the opinion of your                    ~
committee that such a claim would violate the purpose although                         ...
not the language of the present law, and that the possibility of such
a claim in future should be eliminated by the proposed clarifying
amendment.
  Your committee thinks that the Conference should adopt a reso­
lution instructing the Director with respect to the administration
of Section 456 as it now stands. We therefore recommend that the
C-onference adopt the following resolution:
  Resolved that in case the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts shall determine on consideration of the pertinent facts that a
notification of official station by a circuit or district judge is not in accordance
with the provisions of Section 456 of Title 28, USC, the Director shall notify the
judge and unless the Director and the judge shall agree upon a designation of the
official station, the Director shall suspend travel and maintenance payments to
such judge and report his action to tIle Judicial Conference.

   This rejects any construction that the notification by a judge of
his official station is conclusive and binding upon the Director.
  In view of the fact that your committee has been advised that
the General Accounting Office is conducting an investigation of
the maintenance charges made by Judge Healy and has indicated
a desire to have the benefits of the study made by this committee,
we recommend that a copy of this report as approved by the
Judicial Conference be furnished to the General Accounting Office.
  Respectfully submitted.

Illvery such judge shall, upon his appointment, and from time to time thereafter

   Section 259, supra, appears as § 374, Title 28, U. S. Code (1946
edition).
   The Act of June 25, 1948, to revise the Judicial Code, 62 Stat. 869,
et sequi, at page 996, repealed § 374 of old Title 28, and reenacted
it in the following language, as § 456, of the new Title 28, U. S.
Code (Judiciary and Judicial Procedure):
   § 456. Traveling expenses of Justices and Judges.
   Illach justice or judge of the United States and each retired justice or judge
recalled or designated and assigned to active duty, shall, upon his certificate, be
paid by the Director of the Administrative Oflice of the United States Courts all
necessary traveling expenses and also his reasonable maintenance expenses
actually incurred, not exceeding $10 per day, while attending court or transacting
oflicial business at a place other than his oflicial station.
   The oflicial station of the Chief Justice of the United States, the justices of
the Supreme Court and the judges of the Court of Claims, the Court of Customs
and Patent Appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colum­
bia, and the United States District Court for the DIstrict of Columbia, shall be
the District of Columbia.
    The oflicial station of the judges of the Customs Court sball be New York City.
    The official station of each Circuit and district judge, including each district
judge in the Territories and Possessions, shall be that place nearest his residence
fit which a district court is regularly held.
   Illach circuit judge and each district judge whose official station is not fixed
expressly herein shall upon his appointment and from time to time thereafter,
as his residence may change, notify the Director of the Administrative Oflice of
the United States Courts in writing of his reSidence and oflicial station.

  It will be observed that § 259 from the time of its enactment in
1911 until the revision of 1948 contained the phrase "actual resi­
dence" and that the 1948 revision omitted the word "actual."

by Mr. Sutherland (S. 9693, 61st Cong., introduced Dec. 19, 1910)­
"A bill to provide for the payment of the traveling and other ex­

  This bill was reported with an amendment (S. Rep. No. 1149,

1911, and on February 21, 1911, it passed the Senate as follows:

   Senate Bill 9693 was referred to the House Committee on the
Judiciary February 23, 1911. Attached are copies of two letters
from Attorney General Wickersham dated, respectively, February
22 and 23, 1911, to Mr. R. Wayne Parker, the Chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, explaining the purposes of S. 9693,
and urging its enactment. It was reported, with amendments,
in the House (H. Rep. 2254, 61st Cong., a copy of which is attached)
and was committed to the Committee of the Whole House, Feb­
ruary 24, 1911.
                                        22 

   On March 3, 1911, without objection, the bill was laid on the
table, since its subject matter had been incorporated into the bill
(S. 7031) to codify, revise and amend the laws relating to the
Judiciary (the Judicial Code of 1911) which passed the House
on March 2, 1911.
   The text of Senator Sutherland's bill (S. 9693) as introduced
is identical with H. R. 30029, introduced in the House by Mr.
Mann, and offered by him on the floor of the House, February 15,
1911, as an amendment (which was agreed to as an additional Sec.
202bb of the Judicial Code) during debate on the House version
of the Judicial Code (H. R. 23377) for which S. 7031 (an identical
bill) was later substituted. An excerpt from the House debate
showing the proceedings when this amendment was offered, de­
bated, and adopted, is attached (Cong. Record, voL 46, pt. 3,
pp.2613-2615).
   No debates or other informative documents can be found ex­
planatory of the purposes or meaning of the last two sentences
of the section defining residence and beginning with the words:
uThe official place of residence of each justice it it *."
   The Report of the House and Senate conferees dated March 1,
1911, on S. 7031, which became the Judicial Code of 1911 (S. Doc.
No. 848, 61st Cong., 3d sess., at page 7; 46 Congressional Record
3763) states:
   "SECTION 259. This section is intended to take the place of a part
of section 2, all of section 126, and of 202bb, in the bill as it passed
the House." A copy of the full Conference Report as it appears
in the Congressional Record is attached.
   The statement of the managers on the part of the House
explains:
  It was recognized at the time of its adoption that this amendment [sec,
202bb] did not properly belong in the place at which it was offered, and the
suggestion was made in the House that it should be put in its proper place in
the bill by the conferees. The Senate [conferees?] concurred in this amend­
ment, with an amendment limiting th6 <3l1'penS6 for maintenance not to emceed:
$10 per day and ma.king m01'e definite pr01.'isions !'e8pecting tT.e Official l'c~i­
dence of the circuit and district judges, This amendment was placed by the
committee as section 259, under the title of "Provisions common to more than
one court," and its adoption made necessary the striking out of the portion of
section 2 of the bill which contained existing law respecting the payment of the
expenses of the district judges and also section 126 of the bill which contained
existing law respecting the payment of the expenses of the justices and the cir­
cuit and district judges when sitting in the circuit courts of appeals. Section 2
was therefore amended by striking out everything that related to the expense
of the district judges when sitting outside of their districts, and section 126 was
                                            23 

    stricken out altogether. (46 Congressional Record 4002.) [Italics added to
I   emphasize the material relating to the last two sentences defining residence.]
       The two sections deleted from the Senate passed version of the
    Judicial Code by the Conference Report, when Section 259 was
    inserted as a substitute for the House amendment referred to as
    Section 202bb are set forth below. In the Report of the Revision
    Commission (R. Doc. 783, part 2, 61st Cong., 2d sess.) it is indicated
    that these sections merely restated existing law (pp. 13, 329),
    quoting the General Deficiency Act of March 4, 1907, and section
    8 of the Act of March 3, 1891-both quoted in Appendix I to which
    this is attached, as its sources.
      SEC. 2. Each of the district judges shall receive a salary of six thousand
    dollars a year, to be paid in monthly installments; and shall also receive reason­
    able expenses actually incurred for travel and attendance when deSignated or
    requested, in accordance with law, to hold court outside of his district, not to
    exceed ten dollars per day, to be paid on the written certificate of the judge;
    and such payments shall be allowed the marshal in the settlement of his accounts
    with t11(> United States.
      SEC. 1~. Any justice or judge who shall attend the circuit courts of appeals
    held at any other place than where he resides, shall be allowed his reasonable
    expenses actually incurred for travel and attendance, not to exceed ten donars
    per day, the same to be paid upon the written certificate of said judge; and such
    payments shall be allowed the marshal in the settlement of his accounts with
    the United States.

    PAYMENT OF TRAVELING AND OTHER EXPENSES OF UNITED STATES
                             JUDGES
                      FEBRUARY   13, 1911.-0rdered to be printed

    Mr. SUTHERLAND, from the Committee on the Judiciary, submitted
                            the following
                                         REPORT
                                [To accompany S. 9693]

      The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill
    (S. 9693) to provide for the payment of the traveling and other
    expenses of United States circuit and district judges when holding
    court at places other than where they reside, having had the same
    under consideration, report it back favorably, with an amendment,
    and as amended recommend that it do pass.
      In lines 6 and 7 strike out the words "actual and necessary ex­
    penses of travel and maintenance," and insert in lieu thereof "neces­
          2rl4711-i53---4

                                         i



sary expenses of travel, and their reasonable expenses, not to exceed           J
$10 per day, actually incurred for maintenance."                            ,
   The object of this bill, as stated in its title, is to provide for the
payment of the traveling expenses and expenses of maintenance
of the circuit and district judges when holding court at places other
than where they reside.
   Prior to the passage of the so-called jury law of June 30, 1879
 (21 Stat., 43), a district judge was prohibited (sec. 596, R. S.) from
receiving "any other compensation than his regular salary when
holding court outside of his district"; but in that act an appropria­
tion was made "for expenses of judges holding extra terms of court
outside of their districts."
   The sundry civil act of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat., 454), after
making an appropriation for the payment of the expenses of the
district judges when. required to hold court outside of their dis­
tricts, repealed the provision in section 596, Revised Statutes, pro­
hibiting the receipt of "any compensation other than his regular
salary" by a district judge; and since that time an appropriation
has each year been made for the payment of the expenses of travel
and maintenance of the district judges when holding court out­
side of their respective districts. In recent years the amount which
may be allowed has been limited to not exceeding $10 per day "for
expenses actually incurred." The amendment carries into the bill
this restriction.
   Under section 8 of the circuit court of appeals act (1 Supp., 914)
any justice or judge who shall attend that court at any place other
than where he resides is allowed his reasonable expenses of travel
and attendance not to exceed $10 per day.
   Under existing law, when a circuit judge holds circuit court in
any portion of his circuit, or a district judge holds district court
in any portion of his district, he must pay his expenses of travel
and maintenance. The expense of travel and of maintenance,
therefore, when the judges are holding court away from their resi­
dence is, in many instances, quite burdensome; and this burden
will increase as Congress increases the number of places at which
courts are required to be held in the several districts and circuits.
   In addition, section 17 of the act of June 18, 1910 (36 Stat., 557),
requires that no injunction restraining the enforcement of a State
statute upon the ground of its unconstitutionality shall be granted
except the matter be heard and determined by three judges, one              4
of whom shall be either a justice of the Supreme Court or a circuit
                                         25 

        judge. This requirement, in some instances, places upon the judges
II 	    a heavy burden of expenses, in one case the expenses to one of the
        judges called having amounted to nearly $100.

           DEAR MR. PARKER: I learned that the bill (S. 9693) providing
        for the payment of traveling expenses to the United States district
        and circuit judges, passed the Senate yesterday. While there is a
        similar bill (H. R. 22469) pending in the House, I think it would
        be very desirable, since this bill has got through the Senate, to have
        it put through the House as soon as possible. I don't know whether,
        this being Calendar Wednesday, it could be called up today or not;
        but if you would kindly watch your chance and move it when there
        is an opportunity to do so, I should be greatly obliged, and you
        would be doing, as you know, a very valuable thing in the interest
    I   of justice to the judges.
                Faithfully yours,
                                                     GEO. W. WICKERSHAM.

        Hon. R. WAYNE PARKER, M. C.
            Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
                House of Representatives.
          My DEAR MR. PARKER: I have yours of 22 instant regarding the
        various bills relating to judges' expenses. I understand that S.
        9693 has passed the Senate, and is now in the House referred to
        your committee. As you suggest, it gives the judges their neces­
        sary traveling expenses and their expenses of maintenance, not ex­
        ceeding $10.00 a day. Of course, traveling expenses means railroad
        and Pullman fare. The hotel bills of judges when absent from
        home on official business ought to be paid; take, for instance, the
        case of the circuit judges, who, under Section 17 of the Act of June
I   0   25, 1910, are compelled to go from St. Paul to Muskogee, Okla., to
                                 26 

sit with a district judge on an application for an injunction to re­
strain an order made by a State corporation board, which it is
claimed results in confiscation contrary to a constitutional pro­
vision. The judge has to pay his railroad and Pullman fare, his
meals on the train and his hotel bills in Muskogee. This bill pro­
poses to reimburse him for those expenses.
   In like manner, a circuit judge who has a house where he main­
tains his family in St. Paul, may have to go to St. Louis or Denver
to sit in the Circuit Court in an anti-trust or interstate commerce
case under the Expedition Act, and may be kept-indeed has been
kept-sometimes two weeks at a time, and yet has to pay his travel­
ing expenses and hotel bills out of his own pocket. This is not fair.
   Again, district judges are compelled to hold court in some States
in as many as six places, besides that of their own residence, and
yet have not only to pay their traveling expenses, but hotel bills
as well, out of their own pocket.
   Now a Bat allowance of $6 a day would be a great deal better
than the present condition. It would not cover their hotel
bills in all cases, but it would help-indeed, anything would help.
The salaries of judges are small now, and it does not seem right that
they should have to pay all of these expenses out of their own
pocket.
   The bill S. 9693 proposes to reimburse them their actual out of
pocket traveling expenses, and their expenses of maintenance,
limited to $10 a day. If your committee in its wisdom thought best
to change.it to read, "and an allowance of $6 per day to cover ex­
penses for maintenance, etc." I think it would be an not unfair
measure of relief.
   The difficulty with the bill S. 7090 is that it is limited entirely
to district judges, and that it allows them but $6 per day for ex­
penses of travel and maintenance. However, as that bill only
covers expenses while holding court in some other place within the
district whereof he is a judge, I do not think any serious objection
could be made to it.
        Faithfully yours,
                                       Goo. W. WICKERSHAM,
                                             Attorney General.

     TRAVELING EXPENSES OF UNITED STATES CIRCUIT AND DISTlUCT

     FF.JlUUARY   24, 1911.-Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the state
                            of the Union and ordered to be printed

     Mr. PARKER, from the Committee on the Judiciary, submitted the
                             following
                                             REPORT

                                     [To accompany S.9693]

        The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill
     (S. 9693), to provide for the payment of the traveling and other
     expenses of United States circuit and district judges when holding
     court at places other than where they reside, having (lonsidered the
     same, do report thereon with the recommendation that said bill
     be amended as follows:
        Page 1, line 3, insert, before the word "circuit," the words "cir­
"
     cuit justices and the."
        Page 1, strike out from and including the word ((their" in line 6,
     down to and including the word "maintenance," in line 9, viz,
     "their necessary expenses of travel, and their reasonable expenses,
     not to exceed ten dollars per day, actually incurred for mainte­
     nance," and insert in lieu thereof the words "their reasonable ex­
    penses, not to exceed ten dollars per day, actually incurred for
    travel and attendance."
       Amend the title by inserting, after the words "United States,"
    the words Hcircuit justices and."
       By the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. L., p. 826):
       Any justice or judge who shall attend the circuit court of appeals
    held at any place other than where he resides shall upon his written
    certificate be paid by the marshal of the district in which the court
    shall be held, his reasonable expenses of travel and attendance not
    to exceed ten dollars per day, and such payments shall be allowed
    the marshal in the settlement of his accounts with the United
    States.
       In the current appropriation bills (see act of June 25, 1910,
    Stat. L., p. 750) a like allowance for expenses actually incurred is
    made to district judges directed to hold court outside of their
    districts.
                                          28
  In these respects this bill as amended is existing law.
  There is no provision of law for the large expenses which fall
upon district judges holding court away from their residence,
though within their districts, sometimes at a distance of many hun­
dred miles; nor is there provision for attendance of the circuit
justice and circuit judges at the various circuit courts. We believe
that the courts ought to be brought home to the people, and that
Borne provision should be made for this expense so as to encourage
holding of court where most convenient for litigants and witnesses.

   Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike out the last word. I spoke the other
day. when this bill was under consideration, about the power and jurisdiction
of these Commerce Court judges, when they are transferred out into the districts
or the circuits, and I made a suggestion as to that. I did that because one of
the new judges came to me and suggested that the law does not cover the case.
Now, I would like to ask, Does not the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. MOON]
think it would be advisable to put an amendment in here so that the matter could
be thrown into conference, so that if it is necessary to have legislation on this
point to authorize this class of Commerce Court cases to be tried in the country
it could be done?
   )Ir. l\IOON of Pennsylvania. 1!tlr. Speaker, I will admit to the gentleman from
New York [Mr. PARSONS] that that was an omission in the original bilI, that
judges whose labors for a limited period of time will be devoted to serving in
that court and whose appointment-because they are appointed for life-will of
necessity be added to the judicial machinery of the country. And there does
not seem to be any provisions as to where those judges shall go when their
service on this court terminates. The only provision as to their creation was
that no two of them should be taken from the same circuit. The suggestion
may be a very wise one. It seems to me, when we are revising the laws, this Is
the time to take care of the situation that has developed. I therefore shall wel­
come any amendment that may be offered by the gentleman, and would suggest
that we do not attempt to perfect the phraseology now, but carry it into confer­
ence, where we may be able to give it more careful consideration than we can
give to it here on the floor.
   Mr. MANN. I understood during the debate the other day that one member of
the committee would prepare or had prepared an amendment that would cover it.
   Mr. PARSONS. I will Bay to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. MANN] that I
think this section could very readily be amended so as to cover both his pOints.
I see no harm in amending it, and if that phraseology is imperfect it could be
amended in conference. I will offer an amendment.
   Mr. MANN. Yes; let the gentleman offer an amendment, so as to put it in con­
ference.
   Mr. PARSONS. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike out section 202b, and insert in             .,
lieu thereof the following:                                                               1tJ
  The five additional circuit judges authorIzed by the "Act to create a Commerce Court,
and for other purposes," approved June 25, 1910, shall hold omca during good behavior,

      States Supreme Court for service In the district court of any district, or the circuit court
      of appeals of any circuit, or in the Commerce Court, and when so designated or assigned
      for service In the district court or in the circuit court of appeals shall have the power
      and jurisdiction In this act conferred upon the circuit judge in his circuit.
          The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would suggest that the gentleman from
       New York send his amendment to the Clerk's desk.
         Mr. MANN. I am not sure. even under that amendment. what would be the
      situation in case the Customs Cou.rt judge from the New York circuit is assigned
       to hear cases at Savannah.
         Mr. MOON of Pennsylvania. Or in the fourth district. where they have two.
          Mr. MANN. Yes; or in the fourth district, where they have two, as to his com­
       pensation or his traveling expenses. A judge of the court of appeals Is allowed
       his traveling expenses and per diem if he holds court at any place away from his
       home, but he can only hold court in the circuit. A circuit judge is not allowed
       that and a district judge is not allowed that. Now, it is manifestly improper
       to expect that a judge in New York shall be sent to some other part of the country
       to hold court unless he receives his traveling expenses, and I think it would
      be very difficult to get him to go.
         Mr. MOON of Pennsylvania. We will take care of that.
         lVIr. STAFFORD. Does not the gentleman believe that there should be some gen­
      eral provision covering the traveling expenses of all the judges, not only the
      circuit judges but the district judges as well? The gentleman has pointed out
      an embarrassing feature in connection with the traveling of these judges to places
      in the different circuits or districts, which would undoubtedly prevent their going
      to places where they should go.
         Mr. MANN. I have a bill pending which I introduced, prepared by the Attor­
      ney General, to cover the question. I had thought possibly the Judiciary Com­
      mittee would report it before this. I think it could be passed by n,nanimous con­
      sent. I have been carrying it in my pocket for several days to call it to the
      attention of the proper member of the Judiciary Committee.
         Mr. STAFFORD. As I understand, the Senate committee has reported, and the
      Senate has passed a similar bill.
         Mr. MANN. They have reported this same bill. which was introduced in the
      Senate after I introduced it in the House.
         Mr. STAFFORD. And it has passed the Senate, as I understand.
         Mr. MANN. It has been reported in the Senate, but I think it has not passed
      that body. My bill provides:
         That hereafter the circuit and district judges of the United States, and the judge! of
      the district courts of the United States in Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, shall be
      allowed and paid their actual and necessary expenses of travel and maintenance consequent
      upon their attending court in pursuance of law at any place other than their official
      place of reSidence, said expenses to be paid by the marShal of the district in which such
      court Is beld, upon the judges written certificate: Provided, That for the purposes of this
      act each judge shall be deemed to have Ilis official residence at the regular place appointed
      by law for holding tbe court of which he Is commissioned n judge at or nearest to bls pInce
      of actual residence. Every such judge shall, upon his appointment. and from time to time
      thereafter, whenever he may change such official residence, in writing, notify the Depart­
      ment of Justice of the place of his official residence for the purposes of this act.
         Mr. Cox. of Indiana. We have some kind of a law, have we not, under which
      a jodge is allowed traveling expenses to the amount of $10 per day when holding

,0    court a way from his place of residence?
        Mr. MOON of Pennsylvania. Out of his district.
         Mr. MANN. If a district judge is sent out of his district to hold court, he is
      allowed traveling expenses and per diem not to exceed $10 a day. But this
                                         30 

  situation arises in the State of the gentleman from Indiana: We have provided
  for hoilling court in a number of places in that State, and the district judge
 does not hold the court. Why should he? Every time he goes to hold court at
  some place away from his home he pays his expense out of his own pocket,
 including his traveling expenses.
     The circuit court in Indianapolis frequently would like to have one of th~
 circuit judges at Chicago come down and hold court, but why should he? If he
 goes, he has to pay his expenses out of his own pocket. I do not say that he
 should not do it. Some of the judges do it; but anyone can see very readily
 that judges will not be jumping over themselves in their haste to go to some
 other place to hold court when it is done at their own expense, and they get
 neither money return nor thanks.
     Mr. Cox of Indiana. If the gentleman's bill should become a law, what conflict
 would there be between it and the existing law?
     Mr. MANN. There would be no conflict. It would change the $10 a day business.
     Mr. Cox of Indiana. That is what I am trying to get at. It only provides for
 actual expenses?
     Mr. MANN. Yes.
     Mr. MOON of Pennsylvania. The existing law provides for actual expenses not
 exceeding $10 a day.
    Mr. Cox of Indiana. As a mle, do they not collect the $101
    llr. STAFFORD. Oh, no.
    Mr. MANN. As a rule, they did take the $10 without question until there
were some impeachment proceedings a few years ago. Since that time I
 think the judges ha.ve been a little more particular. Up to that time it was
considered to mean $10 a day.
    Mr. Cox of Indiana. I have always been of the opinion that all Government
 employees, I care not whether post-office inspectors or Agricultural Department
 inspectors or Government employees under the Department of Justice, should be
 put squarely upon the expense basis, cutting out this question of per diem. I do
 not believe it is proper. I do not think it is right at all.
    Mr. MOON of Pennsylvania. The judges complain very seriously of being
obliged to keep an account of every little expenditure. They think it is
humiliating.
    Mr. Cox of Indiana. Well, many things are humiliating, but nevertheless are
right.
    lYIr. MOON of Pennsylvania. I think they would agree with the gentleman from
Indiana to limit it to an absolute figure.
    Mr. Cox: of Indiana. No; that is not my proposition. I would put it on an
actual expense account, whatever they have expended.
   Mr. MOON of Pennsylvania. But that is what it is now.
   Mr. STAFFORD. What objection would there be to offering the bill of the gentle­
man from Illinois as an amendment to one of the sections now under considera­
tion, so as to bring the subject into conference?
   Mr• .MANN. If the gentleman in cl1arge of the bill can name any place where
it would be applicable, I would be glad to offer it.
   Mr. MOON of Pennsylvania. It seems to me that it might be made applicable
here almost anywhere if it was coupled with an instruction to this committee
that the committee of conference can put it in where it ought to go, under the
head of circuit judges or district judges. If that can be understood, I would
welcome it.                                                                            (
   Mr. MANN. With that understanding, I will offer it.
   Mr. STAFFORD. I think it should be offered at this point with that understanding,

      The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Olerk will first report the amendment offered
    by the gentleman from New York [Mr. PARSONS].
      The Olerk read as follows:
       Strike out section 202b and insert in lIeu thereof the following:
      "SEC. 202b. The five additional circuit judges authorized by the act to create a Com­

    good behavior, and from time to time shall be designated llnd assigned by the Chief Justice

    diction in this act conferred upon a Circuit judge in lIis circuit."
      The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the
    gentleman from New York.
      The amendment was considered and agreed to.
      Mr. MANN. Now, Mr. Speaker, I offer the following amendment, which I send
    to the desk.
      The Clerk read as follows:
       Insert a new section, as follows:
       "That hereafter the circuit and district judges of the United States, and the judges of
    the district courts of the {;nited States In Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, shall be allowed
    and paid their actual and necessary expenses of travel and maintenance consequent upon
    their attending court ill pursuance of law at any place other than their official place of
    residence, said expenses to be paid by tile marshal of the district in which such court

    Department of Justice of the place of his official residence for the purposes of this act."
                       '"
       The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the
    gentleman from Pennsylvania.
       The question was taken, and the amendment was agreed to.
      Mr. MANN. Does that include the amendment that I offered as an amendment
    to the amendment?
       The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will put the question again. The ques­
    tion is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania as
    amended by the gentleman from Illinois.
      The question was taken, and the amendment was agreed to.
      Mr. :MOON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the
    numbering of the ehapters, when necessary by the addition of a new chapter,
    be made by the Clerk.
      Mr. MANN. Of course it is understood that the Clerk renumbers these sections. 

      Mr. MOON of Pennsylvania. Yes. 

      The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 

    from Pennsylvania?

                                        STATEMENT
       An exactly similar bill was introduced both in the Senate and House, the
    Senate bill being S. 7031 and the House bill H. R. 23377. After the House had
    considered the bill for a number of days the Senate bill was passed and was sent
     to the House; whereupon the House took up the Senate bill, struck out all after
     the enacting clause, and sUbstituted therefor the House bill.
       In this statement the sections are the sections of the bill as reported by the
    conferees. The figures in brackets refer to the sections of the bill as it passed
    the House.
       The Senate, in its consideration of the bill, adopted a number of amendments.
     Many of these amendments were of a mere formal character, to wit:
       SectiollS 13 and 14. The insertion of the words "of all the circuit judges" being
    intended to make the meaning of the sections more clear without in any sense
    changing the character of the sections.
       Amendments to chapter 5, which relate wholly to the geographical d~vision of
     the various States into judicial districts and divisions and the time of holding
    court therein and to the location of deputy clerks for the transaction of the
    business of the courts.
       Numerous changes were made in both the Senate and House in the partieulars
    enumerated, all of which are speCifically set forth in the accompanying report
    and are not in this statment more particularly referred to. The attitude of




,
    both the House and Senate was that such change should be made by the conferees
    as would bring the law into exact accordance with changes that had been made
    by the statutes since the bill was reported. No change made in this chapter
    imposes any expense upon the Government or in any way alters the power of the
     judges, but is made upon the recommendation of Members and Senators simply
    for the purpose of better expediting the business of the courts in the various
    districts and divisions of the country.
       Sectiou 284 [2G9]. The Senate amendment to this section provides for a power
    on the part of a senior district judge of the district containing at least 300,000
    tnhabitants, when the exigencies of the public service require it, to order a venire
    to issue for a second grand jury. This carries into the section the amendment
    made by the act of March 28, 1910.
       Section 289 [274]. ~'he insertion of the word "same" before the word "author­
    tty" in line 14, referring to the transfer of authority from the circuit court clerks
    to district clerks, was made to make the meaning more clear.
       Section 298 [283]. The insertion of the words "or affecting the organization
    of the courts" was intended simply to make it more clear that the abolition of
    the original jurisdiction of the circuit courts should not affect in any way the
    office of circuit judge.
       Section 301 [286]. This amendment fixes the time when this section goes
    into effect.
       To all of these formal amendments the conferees on the part of the House
    assented.
       The other amendments made by the Senate embracing substantive changes
    were as follows :
       SECTION 128 [127]. The insertion of the words "under the copyright laws,"
    thereby making the appellate juriscUction of the circuit courts of appeals final
    in c-opyright cases as it previously was in patent cases.
       SECTION 240 [227]. The insertion of the words "civil or criminal" and the
    words "upon the petition of any party thereto." The effect of this amendment
    is to make more clear the right of the Supreme Court of the United States by
    writ of certiorari to bring before it for review any case in which 'the judgment
          254711-53 --6
                                        40 

or decree of the circuit court of appeals is made final by the provisions of the
act, and to define more accurately the method by which such writ might bl!
obtained.
   SECTIONS 250 aud 251 [237 and 238]. These sections were strickeu out by the
Senate and two new sections substituted therefor. Tbese sections refer to
appeals from tbe court of appeals of the District of Columbia to the Supreme
Court of tbe United States and are intended to place this court upon substantially
tbe same basis respecting appeals as are the courts of appeals in the nine'
judicial circuits of tbe United States, a special exception being made, however,
respecting cases in which tbe validity of any autbority exercised under the
United States or the existence or scope of any power or duty of an officer
of tbe United States is drawn in question; this cxception being made by the
fact tbat tbe seat of government is located in tbe District of Columbia and
questions affecting the scope and power of officers of the United States are special
features of the jurisdiction of the courts of the Distric1: of Columbia.
   In all of these amendments the conferees upon the part of the House concurred.
   The amendments made by the House to the bill were numerous, in a large
number of which the Senate conferees acquiesced without amendment. In four
cases in which amendments were made by the House the Senate refused to
concur and the conferees upon the part of the House acquiesced therein, to
wit:
   SECTION 28. The elimination of this House amendment leaves the removal of
suits from a State c'Ourt to a Federal court hy corporations upon the ground
of diverse citizenship to remain under existing law.
   While the conferees on the part of the House strongly insisted upon the
amendment, the conferees of the Senate insisted that an important change of
tbis kind should be a subject of distinct legislation and should not be attempted
in a bill providing for the codification of the laws.
   SECTION 4.0. The House struck ont the whole section, which was as follows:
   "SEC. 40. The tria1 of offenses punishable with death shall be had in the
 county where the offense was committed where that can be done without great
 inconvenience."
   The House conferees acquiesced in this action beeause this provision was
 existing law and had been in operation since 1789. It has been tlloroughly
 adjudicated by the courts, was carried in by the revisers in 1873, and has
 created no confusion by reason of its existence as part of our judicial system.
    SECTION 118 [116]. An amendment was made by the House as follows:
 "and, as well as the circuit ju"tices, shall have throughout his circuit the powers
 and jnrisdietioll of a district judge."
    The Honse conferees agreed to this being stricken out in view of the fact
 that provision for the assignment of circuit judges to sit in the district court
 when the exigencies of business require it was provided for by section 18 of the
 act.
    SECTION 186 (189). The Honse struck out the words "on account of color."
 The section provides that­
    "No person shall be excluded as a witness in the Court of Claims on account
 of color or because he or she is a party to or interested in the cause or
 proceeding; and any plaintiff or party in interest may be examined as a witness
 upon the part of the Government."
    This was stricken out by the House on the theory that it was a constitutional
 provision. The eontention of the Senate conferees was that it requires afll.rma­
 tive law to give effect to a constitutional provision, and that the omission of
 these worOs from the revision might work an injury to the parties intended
 to be benefited by the constitutional provision.
                                       41 

   In all of the other amendments made by the House the Senate concurred,
with amendments as follows:
   SECTION 21 [20A]. The challenging of a judge on account of personal bias
or prejudice. An amendment was made which required the counsel of record
to certify that in his judgment the affidavit so filed was made in good faith.
   SECTION 24. Concerns the jUrisdiction of the district courts. The House
adopted the following amendment:
   "Except in suits to suspend, enjoin, or restrain the action of any officer of' a
State in the enforcement, operation, or execution of a statute of such State,
upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute."
   '1'his was amended by striking out the provision above recited and substituting
therefor as section 266 the provisions of section 17 of the act of June 18, 1910,
entitled "An act to create a Commerce Court, etc.," as follows:
   "SEC. 266. No interlocutory injunction suspending or restraining the enforce­
ment, operation, or e;x:ccution of any statute of a State by restraining the action
of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute
shall be issued or granted by any justice of the Supreme Court, or by any
district court of the United States, or by any judge thereof, or by any circuit
judge acting as district judge, upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of
such statute, unless the application for the same shall be presented to a
justice of the Supreme Court of the United States or to a circnit or district
judge, and shall be heard and determined by three judges, of whom at least
one shall be a justice of the Supreme C{)urt or a circuit judge, and the other
t,vo may be either circuit or district judges, and unless a majority of said three
judges Shall concur in granting such application. Whenever such application
as aforesaid is presented to a justice of the Supreme Court, or to a judge,
he shall immediately call to his assistance to hear and determine the applica­
tion two other judges: PrO'l/ided, however, That one of such three judges shall
be a justice of the Supreme .court or a circuit judge. Said application shall
not be heard or determined before at least five days' notiee of the hearing has
been given to the governor and to the attorney general of the State, and to
such other persons as may be defendants in the suit: Pl'ovided, That if of
opinion that irreparable loss or damage would result to the complainant unless
a temporary restraining order is granted, any justice of the Supreme Court,
or any circuit or district judge, may grant such temporary restraining order
 at any time before S11Ch hearing and determination of the application for an
interlocutory injunction, but such temporary restraining order shall remain
 in force only until the hearing and determination of the application for an
interlocutory injunction upon notke as aforesaid. The hearing upon such
 applieation for an interlocutory injunction shall be given precedence and
 shall be in every way e;x:pedited and be assigned for a hearing at the earliest
practicable day after the e>"'1Iiratioll of the notice hereinbefore provided for.
 An appeal may be taken direct to tbe Supreme Court of the United States
 from the ordnr granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory
 injunction in such case."
    SECTlON 24 was flllther amended by the House so as to increase from $2,000
 to $5,000 the amount necessary to g'ive the Federal courts jurisdiction of the
 classes of cases included therein.
    SECTION 30. Regulating the removal of cases to the Federal courts in which
 title to land is claimed under grants from different States, was also amended by
 increasing the jurisdictional amount from $2,000 to $5,000.
    The Senate concurred in each of these amendments, with an amendment
 reducing in each case this amount to $3,000, in which the HOllse conferees
 concurred.
                                        42 

   SECTION 29. The House amended this section, which provides for the removal
of cases, by requiring the party removing the case to file in the Federal court,
within 20 days from the date of filing the petition and bond, a certified copy of
the record of the case in the State court, and of pleading within 20 days there­
after, instead of on or before the first day of the next term of the court; and by
requiring notice to be given the ad\"erse party of the filing of the petition and
bond for removal.
   The amendment made thereto at the instance of the Senate conferees was to
fix the time at 30 instead of 20 days, and to substitute for the words "due notice"
the words "written notice," in which the House conferees concurred.
   SECTIONS 55 and 56 [54A]. The Senate agreed to this amendment, with an
amendment making the proviso of the section a separate section, and by amend­
ing the proviso so that the order of the district court should continue unless
disapproved within 30 days by the circuit court of appeals or by a circuit judge,
and by eliminating matter rendered unnecessary by reason of this change.
   The House conferees concurred in this amendment for the reason that in their
judgment the change thus effected would continue the supervision of the circuit
judges over such apPOintment as fully as provided in the amendment adopted by
the House, and would at the same time avoid legal complications that might
ensue if the appointment during the interval before approval might be construed
to be of a tentative character only.
   SECTION 140 [139]. The payment of salaries is made monthly instead of quar­
terly, in order to conform to existing law, a general provision of law having
modified the previous special provision in the Revised Statutes in regard to the
Court of Claims which had been incorporated in the bilI.
   SECTION 151 [155]. This section is one in which the House rearranged and com­
bined certain prOvisions of the Bowman and Tucker Acts. The Senate assented
thereto with two amendments. First, by striking out the words "or the commit­
tee thereof to which it shall have been referred, also may." Under the Bowman
 Act a committee of either House of Congress could refer claims to the Court of
 Claims without any act upon the part of Congress. This practice has not been
followed in recent years by the Senate Committee on Claims, nor is it possible
under the Tucker Act, which was of later date. This amendment prevents such
 manner of reference in the future. All such claims can still be referred by a
 resolution of either House instead of merely a resolution of the committees
 thereof. The second amendment is intended to relieve the court ()f the duty of
finding all the facts of a case submitted to it when its preliminary inquiry shows
that laches have been such that the claim ought not to be paid. This provision
wiII relieve the Congress of having to consider the facts in regard to claims as t()
which the court has found inexcusable laches.
    SECTION 157. This section was stricken out because it was taken from the
Bowman Act and was a qualification of that act. If left in the bill, it would
qualify the Tucker Act and so change existing law, and would remove from the
 Court of Claims jurisdiction of a large number of cases of which it was given
 jurisdiction by the Tucker Act.
    SECTION 182. Is intended to give to the United States as trustee for Indian
 tribes the right of appeal from the Court of Claims in certain cases.
    SECTION 216a [229]. This section was rewritten to make the meaning more
 clear; and in line 13, page 200, the word "directed" was stricken out; and after
 the word "thereof," in line 11, page 201, the following words were added: "No
 distribution of reports or digests under this section shall be made to any place
 where the court is held in a building not owned by the United States, unless there
 be at such place a United States officer to whose responsible custody they can
                                        43 

be committed," These words make the section eonform in this respect to the
section relating to the distribution of the Supreme Court reports.
   SECTION 226 (214]. The House adopted an amendment providing that the
volumes of the decisions of the Supreme Court after August 5, 1882, should be
furnished to the public at a sum not to exceed $1.50 per volume in lieu of the
price of $2, as provided by existing law, The Senate accepted this amendment
with an amendment fixing the price at $1.75 per volume, respecting current
and future volumes; but amended it so as to provide that the volumes previously
published shall be furnished at the rate of $2 per volume, This was considered
necessary because of the fact that the back volumes had all been published under
an existing contract permitting the reporter to charge $2 per volume for the
same, and the present reporter has no control over the price of these volumes,
  SEC'l'ION 227 (215]. The Senate added as an amendment thereto the require­
ment that there should be furnished to the Secretary of the Senate for the use
of its committees 25 copies instead of 20, as provided by the House.
   SECTION 259. The House adopted an amendment which appears in the bill as
section 202bb, providing as follows:
  "SEC. 202bb. The circuit and district judges of the United States and the
judges of the district courts of the United States in Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto
Rico shall be allowed and paid their actual and necessary expenses of travel and
maintenance consequent upon their attending COUrt in pursuance of law at any
place other than their official place of residence, said expenses to be paid by
the marshal of the district in which such court is held, upon the judge's written
certificate: Pro!,'ided, That for the purposes of this act each judge shall be deemed
to have his official residence at the regular place appointed by law for holding
the court of which he is commissioned a judge at or nearest to his place 'of
actual residence. Every such judge shall, upon his appointment, and from time
to time thereafter, whenever he may change such official residence, in writing,
notify the Department of .Tustice of the place of his official residence for the
purposes of this act."
  It was recognized at the time of its adoption that this amendment did not
properly belong in the place at which it was offered, and the suggestion was
made in the House that it should be put in its proper place in the bill by the con­
ferees. The Senate concurred in this amendment, with an amendment limiting
the expense for maintenance not to exceed $10 per day and making more definite
provisions respecting the official residence of the circuit and district judges.
This amendment was placed by the committee as section 259, under the title
of "Provisions common to more than one court," and its adoption made necessary
the striking out of the portion of section 2 of the bill which contained existing
law respecting the payment of the expenses of the district judges and also section
126 of the bill ,vhich contained existing law respecting the payment of the
expenses of the justices and the circuit and district judges when sitting in the
circuit courts of appeals. Section 2 was therefore amended by striking out
everything that related to the expense of the district judges when sitting outside
of their districts, and section 126 was stricken out altogether.

ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE LAW DEALING WITH
                 MAINTENANCE EXPENSES OF JUDGES

             (Now embodied in Title 28, U. S. C., § 456)

                  I. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

                           The Buffington Case

   Question was first raised in this matter by a letter from Mr.
Walter C. Fetters, United States Marshal for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania dated January 6, 1933, to Mr. John W. Gardner,
General Agent and Chief Clerk of the Department of Justice. He
f;tated that Circuit Judge Joseph Buffington of the Third Circuit
had an official residence at Pittsburgh, PH., and submitted vouchers
for maintenance for the full number of days in each month be­
cause he was attending court at all times in Philadelphia. He said
that on this account he could not comply with a Department of
.Tustice circular (No. 2310, dated July 29, 1932) which required
the statement of the hour of arrival and departure in Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia, because Judge Buffington did not travel back
and forth between the two cities. He informed the Department
that due to this difficulty he was withholding payment of Judge
Buffington's vouchers and asked for departmental instructions.
   The Marshal's inquiry was answered by Assistant Attorney
 General Monte Appel on January 9,1933, on the basis of a memo­
randum to him of January 7, 1933, which reads in part as follows:
   * * * As to Judge Bufltngtoo a more serious question is presented. His offi­
cial residence, as shown by our records, is Pittsburgh, but I am reliably informed
 (off the record) that he moved to Philadelphia several years ago, and that he
is now, and has been for some time, actually domiciled in Philadelphia. An
examination of the l\1arshal's accounts shows that during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1931, Judge Buffington certified that he attended court at Philadelphia
for 283 days and that his actual expenses for maintenance amounted to $10
per day, for which he was paid the sum of $2,830, in addition to his salary.
During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1932, he certified that he was engaged at
Philadelphia on official business for 355 days, and that his actual expenses
amounted to $10 a day, for which he was paid the sum of $3,550 in addition to
his salary.
   Title 28, Section 374, U. S. Code, provides that:
   "The official place of residence of each circuit and district judge shall be at
that place nearest his actual residence at which either a circuit court of appeals
or a district court is regularly held. Every such judge shall, upon his appoint­
                                       (44)
                                            45

    ment, find from time to time thereafter whenever he may change his official
    residence, in writing notify the Department of Justice ot his official place of
    residence."
       Judge Buffiugton appears never to have notified the Department of any change
    in his official residence, and he may claim that his "actual residence" is still in
    Pittsburgh. As a matter of fact, however, his office is in Philadelphia, his secre­
    tary is in Philadelphia, his expense accounts show that he has been living there
    (·,mtinuously for several years; it must be held to be his actual find official resi­
    dence, within the meaning of the statute quote above, notwithstanding he has
    not notified the Department of any change.
       I recommend that the Marshal be advised to withhold further payments to
    Judge Buffington, on account of per diems in lieu of subsistence, until he can
    convince the Department that he is an actual resident of PittsbUrgh, and not of
    Philadelphia:'
       Accordingly, Mr. Appel's letter to the Marshal of June 9, 1933,
    suggested that no further subsistence payments be made to Judge
    Buffington lIuntil he can satisfy the Department that he is not an
    actual resident of Philadelphia."
       No further correspondence can be found in the Department of
    Justice files relating to this matter until May 15, 1934, when Judge
    Buffington wrote to Mr. C. E. Stewart, who had by then become
    the Administrative Assistant to the new Attorney General (Mr.
    Cummings). Apparently this letter was written in answer to one
    from Mr. Stewart dated April 16, dealing with Judge Buffington's
    official station; but no copy of that letter can be located in the
    Department files. In his letter Judge Buffington says, "My official
    residence has always been in Pittsburgh. No question was ever
    raised, or could have been raised, about my actual residence there
    until 2 or 3 years ago. Our court sits altogether in Philadelphia
     [2 terms annually, 1 beginning in October, the other in March.
    Two sessions of 2 weeks for argument are held each term and con­
     tinued until all ready cases are heard~2 weeks each month in
    October, November, December and January and 2 weeks in March,
    April, May and June--none in February, July, August, or Septem­
    ber as these months are used to clear up accumulations and belated
    cases and to write opinions. In months of argument, the weeks
    not so used are spent in conferences and writing opinions].
      All of my relatives and most of my friends live in and near Pittsburgh, where
    I have actually resided during all these years, with the exception of the last
    2 or 3 yefirs, when I have remained more in Philadelphia because it was the late
    Mrs. Buffington's home. Now, since she is dead, I shall make Pittsburgh unques­
    tionably my actual residence so that I can be with my family and folks, and shall
    stay in Philadelphia as a transient at a hotel, only so long as is necessary to
t   perform the official work of the court there advantageously!
      ~ The New York Times of October 22, 1947, when Judge Buffington died, indicates that
    in 1981 he married Mrs. Mary Fullerton Jones of Phlladelphia, who died in 1988.
                                             46 

   You made your position very clear. I thoroughly understand it and think it
Is entirely correct. In saying that PIttsburgh is my actual, as well as my official,
residence, I believe that I come not only within the letter but also within the
spirit of the law as you have stated it. I shall deeply appreciate it if you will
instruct the Marshal as to the payment of my per diem allowance for main­
tenance and my expenses of travel between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia begin­
ning March 5th of this year.

   This letter was referred by the Administrative Assistant (Mr.
Stewart) to the General Agent (Mr. Gardner) with the notation:
til think he has justified his position, don't you think so."
   Mr. Stewart then wrote the United States Marshal at Philadel­
phia on May 22, 1934, authorizing payments on account of main­
tenance at Philadelphia on and after March 5,1934, sending a copy
to Judge Buffington:
  The Department has been informed by Judge Buffmgton that his actual resi­
dence has been at Pittsburgh since March 5, 1934, and accordingly the Depart­
ment withdraws its objection to the payment of Judge Buffington's traveling
expenses and per diems in lieu of subsistence, while engaged on official business
at Philadelphia, and payments may be made accordingly on certified accounts
submitted by the <Judge, effective from and after the date mentioned.

  The Department of Justice files do not show any official action
after May 1934 to question Philadelphia maintenance expense
payments to Judge Buffington on account of actual residence there.
  An examination of the expense vouchers submitted by Judge
Buffington shows the following payments to him for maintenance
while holding court in Philadelphia from January 1, 1934, through
the end of February 1939. In each case the Judge stated on the
voucher that Pittsburgh was his official residence:

   2 Preaudited.  The vouchers for maintenance at Philadelphia presented by Judge Buf.
fington for September, October, and November 1934 and for December 1935 and FebruaI7
1936 were submitted before payment to the General Accounting Office for preaudit. iIn
each case small sums, ranging from $2.50 to $11.25 were deducted from the amounts
claimed; but it is clear that in no case did the General Accounting Office question the
propriety of the designation of Pittsburgh as the official residence.

                                  The Evans Case
   On September 7, 1933, Mr. J. W. Gardner, General Agent in
the Department of Justice, had called to his attention the large
subsistence payments made from October 31, 1931, through June
30, 1933, to Judge Evan A. Evans, United States Circuit Judge
for the Seventh Circuit, for attending court in Chicago (Depart­
ment memo-H. L. Collins to Mr. Gardner, Sept. 7, 1933). Mr.
Gardner in turn called this to the attention of Mr. C. E. Stewart,
Administrative Assistant to the Attorney General, pointing out
that the case seemed similar to that of Judge Buffington whose pay­
ments for subsistence at Philadelphia had recently been ordered
stopped (memo, J. W. G. to Mr. Stewart). Thereupon, Mr.
William Stanley, the Assistant to the Attorney General, wrote
Judge Evans that an examination of the accounts of the United
States Marshal for the Northern District of Illinois showed that
Judge Evans had been continuously in Chicago from October 1931
 to July 1933 and had been paid for that entire period the maximum
 allowance for subsistence except for a few weeks in August and
 September 1932. The letter states that the Department of Justice
 records showed Judge Evans' official residence to be at Madison,
 Wis., and raised the question whether in view of the Judge's con­
 tinuous presence in Chicago, that city was not now his actual
   • Judge Buffington retired on June 1, 1938.

residence. Mr. Stanley then observed, "If so, it would also become
your official residence and no expenses of subsistence would be
allowable at that place." The letter closes with a request for an
expression of Judge Evans' views.
   On September 28, 1933, Judge Evans answered Mr. Stanley, ex­
plaining his status and the reasons for his view that his official
residence continued to be at Madison. His letter was in part
as follows:
   ......... In reply, I will say that I was appointed to this position May 1916. This
circuit comprises Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois. The court was composed of
4 judges, 1 from Indiana, 1 from Wisconsin, and 2 from Illinois. For various
reasons it was deemed advisable that the various judges should retain their
residences in the states wherein they resided at the time of appointment. I
live at Baraboo, Wis., and Madison became my official residence because of the
provisions of the statute which made the place the nearest place where a Federal
court was held, my official residence.
   The work of the court at that time was not nearly so heavy as it has since
been. In a single year we sometimes had only 00 cases. This October session,
we have 84 cases, and for the year will probably have nearly 225 cases. I spent
about half of my time in the District Court when first appointed and during the
first 5 years I was on the bench. Unfortunately as the work grew heavier we
found ourselves short 1 of the 4 judges. In fact, we have not had but 3 judges
sitting in this court for the last 3 years. When I sat more in the district court
and when the work was lighter here, I traveled back and forth from my legal
residence in Baraboo a great deal. I frequently sat in Superior, Wis., and in
Madison.         Judge Sanborn died a year or two after I was appointed and his
successor was not named for nearly 2 years. However, for the last 4 or 5 years,
I have found it advisable to keep in or near Chicago more than before. In
addition to hearing a case in the Court of Appeals we judges have found it
necessary to be in close contact for the larger part of the year in order to have
conferences and to dispose of emergency matters, etc. Three of us therefore
are nearly always here in Chicago. However, I have kept my residence in
Baraboo. I have a home there. I vote there, and shan continue to do so re­
gardless of the action of the Government respecting my maintenance when in
Chicago. In other words, I am a citizen of Wisconsin and expect to live in


                                                      . . .
Wisconsin after I retire. For that reason I keep my home there. My children
have lived there.
    ...          ...         ...          ...
  I assume that I had the right to choose my actual residence and my official
residence was defined by [the statute] ......... I rent a small furnished apart­
ment here in Chicago; I have never owned a home here. Only such books and
wearing apparel as Mrs. Evans and I require are placed in this apartment.
All of our treasures and permanent household possessions are in Wisconsin. It
is on this theory that I have presented the maintenance bills to which you
refer.

  On October 4, 1932, Mr. Stanley replied to Judge Evans, stating
that it seemed to the Department of Justice that the Judge con­
fused the term "official residence" with "legal residence," and ask­
ing him to give the matter further consideration and "please advise
                                        49 

the Department whether your official residence has been changed
to Chicago." The gist of the letter is in the following excerpt:
  '" "'. It seems to the Department that you are confusing the term official
residence with legal residence. Your legal residence is Baraboo, Wis., where you
vote and maintain your permanent home. Your official residence has been at
Madison, Wis., for the reason that at the time of your appointment this was the
nearest place to Baraboo at which a regular term of court was held. The statute
makes no reference to "legal residence," but uses the words "actual residence,"
which, of course, means the place where you actually reside and have your
abode, and it appears from your letter that you and your wife have rented an
apartment in Chicago, and that you spend your entire time there, except during
the summer vacations. The statute seems to contemplate that a judge will be
reimbursed for expenses which he may incur, from time to time, on trips away
from his home to attend upon court, and that, if he changes his residence, he
will notify the Department. It apparently is not contemplated that a judge may
actually and continuously reside at the place where he is holding court, and
draw expenses of maintenance.
   On December 16, 1933, Judge Evans sent Mr. Stanley a lengthy
answer reiterating his position. After some discussion of the
recent business of his court, which he said makes it necesary for
at least two judges to be in Chicago, he states his views of the pur­
poses of the statute regarding judicial residences as follows:
   '" * '" Obviously, it seems to me that it was to provide for his maintenance
when official duties took him away from his home-the place he would be if the
official duties did not call him away. The number of days he is required to de­
vote to his Official duties is not in the least determinative of his residence. Our
Court of Appeals in 1916, when I was appointed, did not have one-third of the
work it now has. The tirst 4 or 5 years I sat on this bench, I devoted fully half
of my time to District Court work.
  In construing the statute or in disposing of a legal question, I like to consider
it on its merits, rather than base my conclusion on technical grounds. Hence
the foregOing statement.
  However, this question, in the last analysis, is one of statutory construction.
  Section 374, Title 28, U. S. C., provides for the selection by the judge of his
official residence when he is appointed.
  First, it is to be noted that the judge 'fiUJkes the seZection. This is of course
natural, proper, and reasonable. Each judge is expected to contribute to the
court some of the views and understanding of the profession of his State on
substantive law, as well as on State practice and procedure. The territorial
jurisdiction of our court includes Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. The Presi­
dent has always appointed 1 judge from each of these States, and when the
court is fully organized, we have 2 judges from IllinOis, the largest of the 3
States. Various practice acts (the recent Bankruptcy Act relating to railroads
being one) necessitate our acquaintance with the members of the bar and famili­
arity with the State court holdings and State court practice. I was even advised
when appionted, and have believed ever since, that it would not be in the spirit
of the law to move from Wisconsin, though I have given serious thought to
moving to Madison, Wis., or Milwaukee, Wis., where I could have access to the
Federal court library.
                                        50 

    Then, too, note in this last sentence of section 874 the words "whenever he
may change his QjJtciaZ residence."      They suggest, if they do not clearly say,
that the judge in the first instance selects his official residence and second, he
 (not anyone else) may change his official residence.
    Inasmuch as the judge notifies the Department of his official place of residence
when he is appointed, it is fair to assume that the official residence is determined
by its proximity to his then legal residence, which in my opinion defines his
actual residence. Living in Baraboo, Wis., a short distance from Madison, Wis.,
I naturally notified the Department that Madison was my official residence. A
Federal court was held at Madison and was not held at Baraboo.
    It is not uncommon for one to speak of his legal and his actual residence as
meaning the same thing. And that is what Congress intended here.
    If, however, there is a difference in meaning between the words "actual" and
"legal," then I also wish to stress the noun, the word "residence," as well as
 the adjective "actual." Residence has a well understood meaning. Residence
 controls legal and actual. Before determining legal or actual residence, we must
first understand the meaning of residence. My residence is not in Chicago. I
 stay here. I reside in that place which I call home, in that place where I .vote,
 in that place where I pay my personal property tax, in that place where I
 report to my home State, Wisconsin, my income for State income tax purposes.
My residence is the reSidence of my children, to which place, on their vacation
from college, they return. If my actual residence were determined by the
number of days that I spent in a certain place, it would be constantly changing,
and moreover, the court, by prescribing duties which kept me at one place over
 half of my time, could thereby determine my residence. To illustrate to what
 illogical positions this contention would lead, let me call attention to other
 circuits where court is held in different cities. If the sessions were of unequal
 length and they together occupied 10 months of the judge's time, where would
 the judge's residence be? As against the 10 months' time he was away, could
 he not assert a Wisconsin residence if within the jurisdiction? If not, would
 lIe have tl changing residence, if the length of the terms of court varied greatly
 in different years? And how long would he have to be in the new place before
 his residence would change?
     I appreciate that I have dictated conSiderably longer than I intended. How­
 ever, I feel quite strongly on the matter and would be glad to discuss the question
 with you, if you are ever here in Chicago. There are strong personal attachments
 which cause me to prefer Baraboo, Wis., as my home. I need not relate them
 to you in this letter. They are, it is needless to say, those sentimental attach­
 ments which are a part of us all.
    I sincerely trust that the work of this court may permit me to be away from
 here longer than during the last few years when the work overloaded the partially
 filled court. And I also trust you will not so construe the law so that I (and my
 aSSociates), to maintain our residences at our chosen spots, will not be driven
 from the spot where our official work can best be performed.
   Upon receipt of this letter, the General Agent, Mr. Gardner,
again called the matter to the attention of the Administrative
Assistant (Mr. Stewart) who referred the entire file to Mr. Alex­
ander Holtzoff for a study of the statute. In Mr. Gardner's memo­
randum of December 20, 1933, he indicates again his view that the
situation was similar to that of Judge Buffington, where the Mar­
shal had been ordered to suspend payments, and he says that
                                       51 


Marshal Laubenheimer in Chicago had now been instructed not
to make further payments to Judge Evans for maintenance ex­
penses in Chicago.
  On December 21, 1933, Mr. Holtzoff sent a memorandum to
Mr. Stewart on the subject, stating it to be his opinion that
Judge Evans should not be permitted to draw any further per diem
for attendance on his official duties in Chicago. After restating
the facts as shown by the file, and quoting the statute (Judicial
Code of 1911, Section 259) Mr. Holtzoff says:
  • • • It will be noted that the judge's Official reSidence depends upon the
place of his actual residence for the statute provides that the official residence
must be the place nearest his actual residence where the court is regularly
held. What is a person's actual residence is a question of fact. A judge may
not arbitrarily name a place as his actual residence. In this case it appears
that Judge Evans maintains an apartment all the year round in Chicago, where
he and his wife live continuously, except during the summer vacation. That
fact would seem to constitute Chicago and not Baraboo, Judge Evans' actual
residence. The mere fact that he maintains a voting residence in Wisconsin
and owns a home which he is not occupying does not detract from the fact
that he actually resides in Chicago. Practically every official and employee of
the Department of Justice, other than those who were born or brought up in
the District of Columbia, have a voting residence in some state. On Judg('
Evans' theory they would all be entitloo to draw a continuous per diem for
subsistence when working in WashIngton.
  The very fact that the statute uses the phrase "actual residence" and not
simply residence, would seem to indicate that Congress contemplated by "actual
residence," the place where the judge was actually living or dwelling permanently.
  Any other construction would seem to defeat the spirit and the purpose of
the statute. Obviously, the intention of the ft'amers of the act was to pay
subsistence to judges while they werc attending official duties away from
home, so as to reimburse them for the additional expenditures that they incur.
Unquestionably Judge Evans' present home is Chicago, and he does not incur
any additional expenses by living there.
  It seems to me that the arguments he advances in support of his position
are not well taken.
  He suggests that he has the right to choose his actual residence. Undoubtedly
he has, but he has no right to choose an actual residence and then name a
different place as his actual residence. He has actually selected Chicago as
his actual residence and for that reason he has no right to name Baraboo.
  He further seeks support in the last sentence of section 374, which requires
him to notify the Department of Justice whenever he may change his official
residence. He argues that he alone may change his official residence. But
whether he changes his official residence is a question of fact and does not
depend on whether or not he has performed the duty of notifying the Depart­
ment of such change. Under the statute whenever his actual residence changes,
his offieial residence changes automatically, the latter being that place nearest
his actual residence where a Federal court is held.
  The judge refers to the fact that there are strong personal attachments which
cause him to prefer Baraboo for his home. Undoubtedly he has a right to such
a preference, but the fact is that he Is not now actnally making that place his
home even though he may expect to go back there after retirement.
                                       52 

   He further suggests that difficulties might arise in the case of a court whose
sessions were held in different places. It seems to me that the solution would be
simple. If the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held one or more
sessions away from Chicago, where Judge Evans maintains an apartment all
the year round, then obviously he could collect per (liem for the periods he was
a way from Chicago.

  On December 26, 1933, Mr. William Stanley (the Assistant to
the Attorney General) replied to Judge Evans' letter of Decem­
ber 16 by sending him a copy of the Holtzoff memo of December 21,
19'33, and stating that for the reasons given in it, the Department
had concluded to adhere to its position "that you are not entitled
to draw per diem in lieu of subsistence while in attendance upon
court, and performing other official duties, in Chicago."
   There is no further reference in the files to the matter until
September 26, 1934, when the General Agent (Mr. Gardner) sent
a memorandum to Mr. Stewart (the Administrative Assistant),
saying that Judge Evans had called upon him and requested that
Mr. Stanley (the Assistant to the Attorney General) reconsider the
matter of the allowance to him of subsistence payments while
holding court in Chicago. This memorandum states that Judge
Evans admitted that he was physically present in Chicago about
ten months of each year, but that he contended the length of time
made no difference.
   Mr. Stewart referred the matter again to Mr. Stanley, with the
notations "I think the judge is wrong-there is no change in the
matter since we settled it before."
   Accordingly, on October 2,1934, Mr. Stanley again wrote Judge
Evans. He said that the matter had been reexamined, and he
 would be glad if the facts and law permitted him to reverse his
position, but he found himself reluctantly unable to do so, giving
his reasons as follows:
  • * * The statute governing this matter (U. S. Code, Title 28, Section 374)
makes the right to a per diem allowance dependent on the judge's actual resi­
dence, rather than his residence in a technical legal sense. In view of the fact
that, as I understand, you live in Chicago with your family continuously ten
months of the year, I should hesitate to make a finding that Chicago is not your
actual residence.
  It is my understanding that the purpose of a per diem allowance is to make
some contribution to a judge's living expenses when he is compelled to be away
from home. It is not dependent on the question as to where his technical resi­
dence is for the purpose of voting, taxation, etc.
  You will, of course, not overlook the fact that the accounts of the disbursing
officer are subject to audit by the Comptroller General, and should a per diem
allowance be paid in an instance where it is not legally owing, the accounts of
the disbursing officer would be disallowed.
                                     53 

   Here the matter apparently rested until 2 years later, when, it
seems that sometime in October 1936, Judge Evans discussed it
personally in Washington with Assistant Attorney General Dickin­
son (note from Judge Evans to him, dated October 1936 which does
not mention the subject by name but says "May I call your atten­
tion to the subject which I discussed confidentially with you while
I was in Washington. I am quite anxious that it not be
overlooked.") .
   Apparently he also, at the same time discussed the matter per­
sonally with Mr. Joseph Keenan who had then succeeded Mr.
Stanley as the Assistant to the Attorney General, for the file shows
that a letter was written in his office on October 16, which read as
follows:
  I respectfully suggest that you address a communication to the Attorney
General stating where you desire your headquarters 1ixed; also advise him
your place of residence. Wherever you certify these designations, that is the
information which we will carryon our records and instructions will be issued
immediately in accordance therewith.

   Assistant Attorney General Dickinson looked into the matter,
and on October 24, 1936, Mr. Stewart (the Administrative Assist­
ant) wrote him a memo sending him the file (including the Holtzoff
memorandum of October 21, 1933), and stating his opinion that
HThe Judge is undoubtedly wrong in his claim that he is entitled
to per diems in the circumstances which he has described." Ap­
parently, on account of Mr. Stewart's opinion, Mr. Dickinson
allowed the matter to rock along without writing Judge Evans,
though he personally felt some allowance should be granted.
(Memo-Johnston Avery, Office Manager, Antitrust Division to
Mr. Andretta, January 30, 1937.)
   The letter dated October 16,1936, written in Mr. Keenan's office
was never mailed. The draft was submitted to Mr. Andretta,
who had then become the Acting Administrative Assistant succeed,.
ing Mr. Stewart, by Mr. Holtzoff who questioned its accuracy.
Mr. Andretta referred it to the General Agent (Mr. McClure who
had succeeded Mr. Gardner) who reported (memo to Mr. Andretta
on October 24th) that he could not find the file (it had been sent
that day to Assistant Attorney General Dickinson who kept it until
January 1937 and until then its whereabouts seems to have been
unknown to other interested officials of the Department). With
his memorandum, Mr. McClure gave Mr. Andretta a copy of the
Holtzoff memorandum of October 21, 1933, and suggested that Hif
the situation has changed any the past year and Judge Evans now
                                       54 


actually resides at Baraboo, Wis., and will so certify, the Depart­
ment might properly accept his statement-at least until such time
as a further checking of the facts develops otherwise."
   On October 27, Mr. Andretta as Acting Administrative Assistant
wrote Judge Evans that Mr. Keenan (the Assistant to the Attorney
General) had personally discussed with him the problem of his
subsistence payments in Chicago, and had requested him to inform
the Judge that Mr. Keenan was away from his office until after
election day, but would take the problem up once more after his
return "with a view to a satisfactory settlement if it can be done."
   Apparently this was done and it seems that on November 9,
1936, Mr. Keenan wrote Judge Evans. There is no copy of this
letter in the file, but from Judge Evans' answer of November 11,
1936, it appears that Mr. Keenan wrote the Judge that the letter
of October 16, 1936, set forth above, had been mailed to Judge
Evans and Mr. Keenan, quoting it, asked if it had been received
(since the orginal is in the file, it is clear that the letter of October
16 had not in fact been mailed). At any rate, Judge Evans ans­
wered saying he observed in Mr. Keenan's letter of November 9
the statement that the letter dated October 16, had been sent; he
said he had not received it, but had received only the brief acknowl­
edgment from Mr. Andretta of October 27,1936. He then indicates
that as requested in the October 16, 1936 draft quoted by Mr.
Keenan, he was sending to the Attorney General a formal letter
of the kind recommended, and that he appreciated lithe considera­
tion given to my case" and tithe satisfactory manner of my present­
ing my case through the suggested letter."
   Judge Evans' letter to the Attorney General, mentioned in his
letter to Mr. Keenan, was also dated November 11 and it reads
as follows:
  In view of the fact that there has arisen a ditrerence of opinion as to my
actual residence, I wish to inform you that I still have the same place of resi.
dence as I originally designated.
  When I came upon the bench in May 1916, I selected Baraboo, Sauk County,
Wis., as my actual residence. As Baraboo is only 35 miles from Madison, Wis·
consin, the latter place, to wit, Madison, Wisconsin, became my official place of
residence. I have never changed that residence. I have always desired to live
in Baraboo, Wis., and it was mY actual residence when I was appointed to the
Federal bench. I have always maintained my residence in Baraboo. There I
own my home. There I have voted at every election for 35 years, including this
year. There I pay my taxes, income as well as property taxes. In that place
those who were dear to me are buried. My children have always looked upon
the residence at 104 Seventh Avenue, Baraboo, as their home.
  I request you to record 104 Seventh Avenue, Baraboo, Wis., as my actual resi·
dence and Madison, Wis., as my official residence.
                                        55 

  This was answered very briefly by Mr. Andretta on November
20, 1936, by a note, sending Judge Evans a copy of a letter of the
same date which he had written to the United States Marshal in
Chicago.
  The letter to the Unit.ed States Marshal at Chicago (Mr. William
H. McDonnell) reads as follows:
  The Honorable Evan A. Evans, United States Oircuit Judge for the seventh.
circuit, having stated that his actual residence is Baraboo, Wisconsin, his official
residence, under the law, is automatically fixed at Madison, Wis.
  You are accordingly advised that beginning December 1, 1936, you may properly
pay to Judge Evans the usual per diem of $5 in lieu of subsistence during such
time as he is away from Madison, Wis., in connection with attendance upon terms
of court or the transaction of official bUSiness.
   Apparently this ended the matter, and no further question was
raised by the Department concerning the propriety of the sub~
sistence payments to Judge Evans during his official visits in
Chicago.
   Indeed, the final action in the Evans Case appears to have been
influential in the formulation of a statement of Departmental
policy for similar situations.
   The Department of Justice files show an inter-departmental
memorandum from Mr. S. A. Andretta to Mr. Quinn dated April
15, 1939, which refers specifically to the Evans Case. This was
accompanied by a lengthy survey of the law and prior Depart~
mental action under it, dated April 8, 1939, by Mr. Arthur Robb.
The substance of Mr. Robb's memorandum is stated in Mr.
Andretta's, which reads as follows:
  With respect to the matter of per diems being paid to Judge Evans in Ohicago,
a study 00' the attached file indicates that the Department in the past took the
position that while he maintained a technical residence at Baraboo, his actual
residence was in Chicago and the :Marshal was ordered to stop his per diems
on this basis. Subsequently, :Mr. Keenan ordered the per diem payments re­
stored, no doubt basing his action on the following language in the Act:
  "Every such judge shall, upon his appointment, and from time to time there­
after whenever he may change his official reSidence, in writing notify the De­
partment of .Justice of his official place of residence. (U. S. C., Title 28, sec.
874)."
If Judge Evans says his actual residence is Baraboo, as he has done, I don't see
what else can be done about the matter.
  The problem of judges' per diems is a fundamental one owing to the ambiguity
of the present law. After posing certain questions to :Mr. Robb, he conduded
a search on the problem and the attached memorandum covers the matter
pretty thoroughly. In brief it is as follows:
  That the original Act of the House was clear in its language that a circuit
judge's official residence was to be at a place where a circuit court was held
and a district judge's official residence was to be at a place where the distrlct
                                       56 

court was held. The Senate Bill, which is the present law, was ambiguouB
in its terms. Therefore, it is very difficult to determine what the actual
intent of the Congress was when the present law was enacted.
   You will also note that many judges have interpreted the Act in its intent
to mean that the official residence of a circuit judge was to be at the place
nearest his actual residence at which a CirC'l1it court of appeals is regularlY
held and the official residence of a district judge was to be at the place
nearest his actual residence at which a term of the district court is regularly
held. For a long time, however, the policy of the Department has been to
fix the official residence at a place nearest the actual residence at which either
a circuit court or a district court is held. It is noted, furthermore, that the
Comptroller General has never passed upon this point.
   In view of these facts there appears no justification for the Department to
change its policy of long standing. The matter is really one for legislation
to clear up any ambiguity in the present law.

II. IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
       AND THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              The Jenney Case

  On June 26,1940, the Acting Comptroller General of the United
States, (Mr. R. N. Elliott) wrote Mr. Chandler that a report
of representatives of his office on the accounts and records of
Mr. Robert E. Clark, United States Marshal for the Southern
District of California, had disclosed that the official residences
of certain district judges (mentioning particularly District Judges
Ralph E. Jenney, George Cosgrave, and Campbell E. Beaumont,
all of the Southern District of California) were "not fixed as
contemplated by § 259 of the Judicial Code (reenacted Apr. 22,
1940, in Public No. 469, 76th Cong.)."
   Mr. Elliott stated that since Congress had so recently re'macted
the provisions of § 259 of the Judicial Code, the matter was being
brought to Mr. Chandler's attention for such consideration as he
deemed proper.
   Mr. Elliott's letter incorporates listings of maintenance pay­
ments made to Judge Jenney from July 31, 1938, through Novem­
ber 30, 1939 (17 months), totalling $1,965 for attendance at court
in Los Angeles on a total of 395 days as against only 111 days of
attendance in San Diego, his official residence, during the same
period. For Judge Cosgrave, during the same period the letter
shows payments for maintenance at Los Angeles totalling $1,135
while holding court there a total of 216 days as against only 4 days
of attendance in Fresno, his official residence during that same
period. For Judge Beaumont (who was appointed August 5,
                                      57 

1939), the tabulation presented by Mr. Elliott shows that from
September 1939, through November 1939, he claimed maintenance
payments totalling $125, for attendance at court on 28 days at
Los Angeles while during the same period he was at his official
headquarters in Fresno a total of 40 days.
   On July 10, 1940, Mr. Chandler answered Mr. Elliott's letter.
He pointed out that each of the three judges had designated his
official place of residence; Judge Jenney, San Diego on July 3,
1937, and Judges Cosgrave and Beaumont, Fresno on April 8,
1930, and August 5, 1939, respectively.
   He observed that Mr. Elliott's letter raised a question concerning
the meaning of the provision in § 259 of the Judicial Code relating
to the official residence of judges and that this question had pre­
viously come to his attention. He stated that he planned to
submit it to the Judicial Conference in October, 1940 and ask
whether it wished to give him directions, after which he would
again write the Comptroller General.
   Accordingly, on October 2, 1940, at the regular annual meeting
of the Judicial Conference, Mr. Chandler laid the problem before
that body. He stated the facts regarding Judge Jenney as set
forth in the letter of the Acting Comptroller General, and he ex­
plained that he had received from Judge Jenney a letter on the
subject, indicating that when he was appointed in June, 1937 his
home was in San Diego and there was a general understanding with
Senator McAdoo that he would perform most of his judicial work
there. This plan did not work out and the judge was required
after his appointment to sit almost continuously in Los Angeles.
Mr. Chandler then read to the Conference from Judge Jenney's
letter as follows:
  Under the circumstances I have always felt that I was only temporarily lo­
cated in Los Angeles because of the extreme congestion of this calendar. I have
spent practically all of my time in Los Angeles. Until such time as we get
additional judges it seems vital for me to continue here. Until the spring of
last year I lived at the Biltmore and Ambassador Hotels in Los Angeles. This
arrangement nearly wrecked my health, so Mrs. Jenney and I have rented tem­
porarilya home in Pasadena so that I might have the benefit of home cooking.
However, my residence has always been maintained at San Diego, and I have
always collected the per diem.

   Considerable discussion of the problem, including the facts in
Judge Jenney's situation and the meaning of the words "actual
residence" as they then appeared in the law followed. The re­
sult of the discussion was the adoption of a resolution stating it
to be the sense of the Conference that mere "legal domicile" is not
                                        58 


sufficient to satisfy the words of the statute. Excerpts from the
more significant parts of the discussion follow:
  Mr. CHANDLEl!.. I am bringing up the letter simply because it raises a question
which we are encountering in a number of situations.
  Judge WILBUR. How can there be any doubt about it? The judge bas a right
to determine his residence, unless there is some law to the contrary. That is the
common law, and common sense.
    •           •           •           •           •           •           •
  Mr. CHANDLER. * • * I want to say that as far as the Administrative Omce is
concerned we took the status as we found it, and we have not raised the question.
When the question has been brought up we have had to consider it. The simple
question is whether "actual residence" is to be construed as the place where to all
outward intents and purposes the man is maintaining his abode, or whether it Is
his domicile, his legal residence.
    •           •           •           •           •
  Judge HICKS. Does he have a house down at San Diego?
                                                                •            •
  Mr. CHANDLER. I think he has written me that he has retained his home in San
Diego. In another case a judge wrote me that if he could sell his house where
he had lived before he became judge, he would.
  Judge BIGGS. There is a court house I take it in San Diego, and court is held
there?

    '.          .
  Judge WILBUR. Yes.
                            . . . . .

  The CHIEF JUSTICE. And he goes there. What does he do when he holds court
in San Diego. Does he go back and forth from Los Angeles,
  Judge WILBUR. He has been relieved there a great deal by Judge Neterer and
some of the other Judges. I do not think he has held court there very much.
   Mr. CHANDLER. He has not held court in San Diego. The fact Is that Judge
Jenney has sat there in the whole time since he has been appointed only a very
few days.
    •            •          •           •
  Judge WILBUR. He has chambers in Los Angeles.
                                                     •           •           •
  Mr. CHANDLER. His mailing address, Mr. Whitehurst informs me, is Los
Angeles.
  Judge HAND. I take it that what you really want to know, is, you want a gen·
eral direction?
  Mr. CHANDLER. Oh, absolutely, and this is not by way of criticism of Judge
Jenney. It is a question for instructions in reference to a practice which is
challenged by the Comptroller General.
  Judge HAND. It seems to me the question is whether it is to be determined by
the legal residence, the domicile, or whether the actual residence in thIs case
issumclent to constitute the domicile.
  Mr. CHANDLER. That is it, in a nutshell.
     •           •           •           •           •           •
  Judge FOSTER. The law says "omcial domicile." It is a matter of his con·
                                                                             •
science whether he shall charge when he goes down there to Los Angeles.
  Judge WILBUR. Is that a matter for this conference, anyway? Isn't it between
the judge and the comptroller?
  Mr. CHANDLER. The letter is addressed by the Comptroller General to the
A,dministrative Omce, which is approving from time to time the claims.
  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Your point is as I understand it whether you will approve
the expense voucher.
                                         59 

   Mr. CHANDLER. That is right.
   The CHIEF JuSncE. And the ultimate question is of course a question of law.
   Mr. CHANDLER. That is right.
   The Cm:EF JUSTICE. If you do not approve it, and the man is not paid what he
is entitled to, then he can go to the Court of Claims to have the question decided
upon the facts as they are there found, but in the meantime you have to pass
upon his vouchers.
  Mr. CHANDLER. Exactly.
   The CHIEF JUSTICE. And you want to have the protection of the opinion of
this conference as to how you shall perform that administrative duty--
  Mr. CHANDLER. That is right.
   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The conference not of course taking the responsibility
of deCiding, as courts, what in a particular case would be the right of the party
conccrned, but the general rule that is to be followed.
  Now, how could that general rule be stated, Mr. Chandler? You have con­
sidered this. The statute says, if I have it here, that­
   "The official place of residence of each circuit and district judge shall be at
the place nearest his actual residence, at which either a circuit court of appeals
or a district court is regularly held." The point is, what is an "actual residence":
   Mr. CHANDLER. That is it. It all comes down to tlle construction of the term
"actual residence."
   The CHIEl!' .1USTICE. It is a question of whether "actual residence" means
simply a legal restdence, and whether a legal residence, or what might be found
to be the domicile, is to be regarded as "actual residcnce" within the meaning
of this statute, regardless of where the judge actually makes his home .
     ...         .           ...         ..           ...         ...         ...
   •1udge HAND. It seems to me that very clearly turns on the underlying purpose
of the statute. The pUl'pose is to indemnify a judge for the expenses caused in
traveling from where he lives to the place where he is to do his duty, and I
should think that the circuit judge referred to a circuit court of appeals or It
district court, and similarly the actual residence, I rather think that the under­
lying purpose wouhl construe that finally. Whatever may be his legal domicile
is of no great consequence if he has in fact moved, so it is not costing him anything
to attend in his new place. If Judge Jenney has really not paid anything, and
he has moved there, and he is not running two establishments, he has not been
subject to any expense, and he has no right to reimbursements. Isn't that the
proper way to look at it?
   The CHIEF JUSTICE. In other words, you construe "actual" as having some
significance, "actual residence"?
   Judge HAND. Yes.
   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Congress had some idea when it said "actual residence."
Con/,'Tess knew enough about disputes over domicile and actual residence, and
whatnot, and it must have meant something when it said "actual residence."
The whole point is wheilier, as you say, Judge Hand, when he goes to the place
where he must perform his duties, then his "official residence" is to be regarded
as the place where his actual residence is, where that duty is performed. Now,
if he is a district judge, he may be a district judge in an entire state; I mean,
with a district covering the entire state, or he may be a district judge for a
portion of a state, and I suppose that should be taken to relate to the place
where the particnlar district judge is to go to do his duty. Is that your idea,
Judge Hand?
   Judge HAND. Yes, that is the idea I had, and I think that is borne out by
the "reasonable expenses actually incurred," because I do not think a man is
                                         60 

actually incurring expenses, if he bas moved, we will say, to Los Angeles. It
really he has moved, his expenses have ceased in San Diego. Howe,ver, a court
might, when he died, treat it as his domicile, because of the character of his
temporary residence in Los Angeles.
   Judge BIGGS. :Mr. Chief Justice, I am not clear as to whether or not Judge
Hand is constrUing that phrase distributively or not. I think that act means
insofar as both the circuit and district judges are concerned, that the judge's
offlcial residence is the place nearest the point where a circuit or a district court
is held. I think that applies equally to a circuit judge. In other words, I live
in Wilmington. I think my official domicile, my offlcial residence, is in Wilming­
ton, in spite of the fact that the sessions of the court are regularly held in
Philadelphia; and I think that has a very plain historical backing, because there
were of course circuit judges long before there was circuit courts, and they had
certain functions to perform around the circuit, and then the domicile was, so
to speak, always in a certain district within the circuit.
    Now it has always been my understanding, although there is probably no
official sanction for it under the law as it stands, that a circuit judge was re­
quired or "expected," let me put it that way, to be available in the district
from which he was appointed, so that counsel for example, if they wanted a
 stay or a supersedeas, could apply to a judge, the circuit judge within the dis­
trict, without necessarily going to tile place where a court was holding an official
court, getting aid which the statute permits a circuit judge to give. I think
that Is meant distributively.
   Judge EVANS. What is the meaning of the word "either"?
    Judge HAND. I am a little surprised at the construction of the word distribu­
 tively, because I was reading it definitely as though it was this:
    "The official residence of each circuit judge shall be nearest the place of his
 actual residence, at which a circuit court of appeals is regularly held. The offi­
 cial place of residence of II. district judge shall be nearest the place of his actual
 residence, at which a district court is regularly held." That seems to me to be
 the natural way to read it.
    Judge PHILLIPS. It has always been construed to read the other way.
    Judge HICKS. That differs from the old statute.
    Judge FOSTER. Mr. Chief Justice, the point I wanted to raise was this. The
 judge's expense account is paid OIl bis own voucher. I do not think that we have
 any jurisdiction to say wbat kind of voucher he should send in, nor do I think
 the Director has any leeway. In other words, his duties are ministerial.
    Now, if this judge out there wants to send in an account to which he is not
entitled, he is suhject to impeachment, or if the Comptroller objects to it, he
 will go after Mr. Chandler, be won't go after the judge. He will disallow his
account in some way, ... • *, and he can call upon the judge to refund this, and
if the judge does not do it, then some disciplinary action may be taken against
 the judge. He is very apt to be impeacbed if he does something like that; but
 so far as we are concerned, and so far as the Director is concerned, I do not
 think we have got a thing to do with it.
   Judge PHILLIPS. Well, it seems to me, Mr. Chief JUstice, that this is a pretty
 close question. A judge may go to a place where court is held for a considerable
 length of time. He may go to a hotel. He may go to an apartment, but if be
 maintains and 1,eeps up at bis legal residence a home wbicb he returns to when
 his official duties have been completed, I think tbat is bis "actual residence"
 as contemplated by the statute; but if Judge Jenney has given up his home in
 San Diego and leased it or otherwise disposed of it and is not maintaining it
 as a home, then I think he has put his actual residence in Los Angeles, and I
 think the facts before us are incomplete.
                                             61
       Judge Gno:S-EB. I think that is exactly right. That is exactly my opinion. If
(
   he has given up his home, I think it is a scandal to make a demand on the theory
     that he has retained that, because he retains it as his legal domicile; and I do
     not think he ought to do it; but if he has not done so and has his home still
     there, the fact that he spends the greater part of his time in Los Angeles does
     not seem to me to deprive him of the benefits of the per diem that the law
     allows him.
         '"                                   •                        •           •
       Mr. CHANDLER. It occurred to me the purpose of the Act was plainly to provide
     that the judges who were required to travel in the performance of their duties, to
     go from the place where they normally and ordinarily lived, to somewhere else,
     and therefore incurred the additional expense that always goes with travel, they
     should be made whole, but it really would not seem to me that if a judge had
     elected to become a dweller in a City where he was holding court, that that was
     within the contemplation of the statute. I may be wrong.
       Judge BIGGS. I think the word "home," which is not used in the statute, is
     really what it meant probably, the real substance of it. I should think Judge
     Jenney had given up his home, so to speak, in San Diego, if he had changed-for
     example, if he had a house and sold it, and merely maintained some clothes in a
     clothes closet in his brother's house, something of that sort, and had given up his
     home, why, I think if he intends to return back there and actually regards it as
     his home, that is his actual residence, but I do think that if he maintains a
     home so to speak in Los Angeles, whatever may be the reason, the reason of his
     health or the reason that he wants his family with him, and has put San Diego
     beyond him, I think that his actual residence is in Los Angeles.
        Judge WILBUR. I think if he has moved to Pasadena and set up housekeeping
     there in a private residence, that he has actually changed his residence to that
     place.
        Judge BIGGS. Yes.,

          '"
                      .           .                        '"          '"
       Tile CHIEF JUSTICE... " '" Now, what he means by "my residence had always
     been maintained at San Diego," we do not know, whether he has a house there
     which he still owns and keeps ready for him, or whether he has a house or an
     apartment he has leased there, whether he goes back there-we do not know
     anything about it. Now, how can the Director rule?
       Now, the difficulty it seems to me that inheres in this matter is that under the
     statute the Director is required under the supervision and direction of the Con­
     ference of Senior Judges to have charge of the disbursement of the monies
     appropriated for the maintenance, support, and operation of the courts.
       Now, he is called upon to perform that duty of passing upon vouchers. He will
     have to conduct an inquiry with regard to the personal habits and conduct of
     these particular judges, where the qnestion is raised in relation to them. He has
     his conscience to satisfy in approving a VOUCher, because, whether you l'egard
     that as ministerial or not, it 1s a duty, and it 1s supposed to be performed intelli­
     gently according to the statute, and the Director is bound to do that, This Con·
     ference is asked merely, I take it, for a general suggestion for his guidance on
     this point-whether in the opinion of the Conference and for the purpose of
     guiding the Director he shall regard the words "actual residence" in the statute
     as satisfied by a purely legal residence or domicile apart from the actual abode
     or home of the judge.
       Now, if you are of the opinion that "actual residence" in the statute means
     nothing more than a legal residence or legal domicile and so advise the Director,
     of course his duty will be greatly simplified. If on the other hand you come to
                                       62 

the conclusion that "actual residence" imports something more than a mere legal
residence or legal domicIle, and has the suggestion of ambulating in the sense of
a permanent home, then he has great difficulties possibly in particular cases in
determining whether or not he shall approve a voucher; but you are not asked
I take it to advise him as to that, but only on the general question. Am I right,
Mr. Chandler?
  Mr. CHANDLER. Right, Mr. Chief Justice.
                                                    *                       *
   Judge PARKER. I move it is the sense of the Conference that an actual residence
is required, and that a mere legal domicile is not sufficient.
   (The motion was duly seconded.)
   Judge STONE. Let me inquire as to that. What do you mean by "legal resi·
dence"? Now, that may vary. A man does not have to have a home, he does
not have to rent an apartment, to have an actual residence in a place. For
instance, I live in a hotel. Well, it is as much my actual residence as though
I owned a block of ground with a larger residence on it, and yet I have to go
to St. Louis and other places to hold court. I register in that precinct. I vote
in that precinct.
   Now, if that is not an actual residellce, it would be difficult for me to say
what is.
   Judge GIIO~ER. Nobody would think otherwise.
                                                    *                       *
  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I understalld that this motion, as made and seconded, car­
ries with it the thought that merely "legal domicile" is not sufficient to satisfy
the words of the statute, "actual residence." Now, the motion does not call for
a determination of what an actual residence is, further than that it is not merely
the legal domicile. Is that right?
   Judge WILBUR. Yes. 

   Judge GRONER. That is my thought. 

   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Now, are there further remarks? 

   (The motion was duly agreed to.) 

   Judge HAND. Will that let out the Director? 

   Mr. CHANpI>ER. I do not know. I will do the best I can, and of course it goes 

without saying that the determination made by the judge and the statement to
me of where his residence is settles and concludes with me all questions that are
fairly open. * '" *
   The CHIEF JUSTICE. I suppose the Director in this particular instance might
inform Judge Jenney of the statement of the Conference, and ask for the facts,
to see whether or not he is maintaining an actual residence in San Diego.
  Mr. CHANDLER. That is what I would do.
  The CHIEF JUSTICE. ADd that will guide him.
  The action of the Conference was published in the Report by
the Chief Justice (October sess., 1940, p; 12) as follows:
  With respect to reimbursement for traveling and subsistence expenses in­
curred while attending court or transacting other official business at any place
other than a judge's official place of residenee, as provided by section 259 of
the Judicial Code (U. S. Code, Title 28, § 374), which defines "official place of
residence" as "that place nearest his actual residence at which either a Circuit
Court of Appeals or a District Court is regularly held," it was declared to
be the sense of the Conference that mere legal domicile is not sufficient to
satisfy the words of the statute, "actual residence."
                                       63 


   On November 6, 1940, following the instructions of the Con­
ference, Mr. Chandler wrote Judge Jenney telling him of the
Conference's action, and asking him for more specific information
on the subject that would be helpful. His letter continued:
  The Conference considers that legal domicile is not enough to constitute ac­
tual residence. and the maintenance of a home in Pasadena indicated in your
letter of the 27th of February last is suggestive of actual residence of Pasa­
dena. Nevertheless, I take it that you considered that not only your legal
residence but your actual residence was then in San Diego. If that is your
view I shall be glad if you will advise me of the elements upon which it is
based, such for instance, (if it is a fact) as the maintenance and keeping avail­
able for your use and your occupancy from time to time of a residence in San
Diego with your address there, in order that I may be informed upon the
facts when I write to the Acting Comptroller General.
  My purpose in doing this is not only to carry out the intent of the Judicial
Conference but if possible to put at rest this rather troublesome matter.
  Due to Judge Jenney's illness, no answer was received until
March 18, 1941. In that letter Judge Jenney stated that he had
sold his San Diego home and moved the furniture to a rented
house in Pasadena, with the intention of leaving it there until
wartime restrictions in San Diego would be relaxed so that he could
carry out his plan to build a new smaller home in San Diego, and
the Los Angeles court congestion should become somewhat relieved.
     indicated that in these circumstances it would be perfectly
satisfactory for him to have his official residence determined to
be at either San Diego or Los Angeles. Excerpts from his letter
follow:
  As you are aware, the Southern District of California has three divisions,
(1) the Central Division at Los Angeles, (2) the Northern Division at Fresno,
and (3) the Southern Division at San Diego.
  At the time I took the bench, on November 1, 1937, my home was in San
Diego and had been for twenty-five years theretofore. I accepted the appoint­
ment upon the definite understanding with Senator McAdoo that I was to be
placed in charge of the district court at San Diego, as soon as arrangements to
that effect could be consummated. This arrangement met with the approval of
Attorney General Cummings, as it did, likewise, with Judge James, the Senior
District Judge in Los Angeles.
  Judge James felt, however, that, due to the severe congestion of the calendar
at Los Angeles, I Should give as much of my time as was possible for the first
year or two to the work in Los Angeles. The work at that time was lIght in
San Diego and extremely heavy in Los Angeles.
  For approximately the first two years of my stay here in Los Angeles I main­
tained the same home in which I had lived for years in San Diego. Mrs. Jenney
remained there practically all of the time. I lived at the Biltmore Hotel in Los
Angeles for the first twelve or fourteen months, later moving to the Ambassador
Hotel in Los Angeles. I commuted back and forth to San Diego, only keeping
a single room in the hotel.
                                       64 

   My health suffered from hotel food and, under the advice of my physician, I
took, temporarily. under a month to month lease, a furnished house in Pasadena
in order that I might get home-cooking. I was then maintaining two homes­
my real one in San Diego and a furnished house in Pasadena.
   My San Diego home was a rather large one with considerable garden, expensive
to keep up, and not particularly desirable, on account of its size, for a man and
wife--with no children left at home.
   We, therefore, concluded to put the house on the market with the thought that
it would take a year or two to find a buyer. However, in the summer of 1939 we
had an opportunity of selling, which we accepted. We had not the Slightest
intention of changing our place of residence and, as a matter of fact, immediately
began looking for another house to buy; failing which, we ordered plans pre­
pared for building. In the meantime, we had the problem of storing a large
houseful of furniture. We found we could rent an unfurnished house in Pasa­
dena, in which we could store the furniture, as cheaply as we could store it in
 San Diego. We, therefore, moved the furniture to an unfurnished house at
1334 South El Molino Avenue, in Pasadena. We have never taken any part in
the community life of Pasadena and only considered ourselves as temporary
sojourners there. As a matter of fact, I think that until just recently we have
not slept in the Pasadena house more than once or twice since the 20th of
September of last year.
   Due to service activities and war industry activIties, no houses are presently
available in San Diego, nor is it practicable to attempt to build. After discuss­
ing the situation last month with our San Diego architect and several San Diego
contractors, we have concluded to defer building for the present.
   The result of the foregoing is that we have our furniture in the house in Pasa­
dena and have rather concluded to maintain the house there for the next year
 or two-at least until conditions get more normal in San Diego and the court
 congestion in Los Angeles has been relieved. Everything indicates that I shall
 be required to hold court in San Diego from one third to one half the time each
 year. It is, therefore. not a question which involves much difference of expense
 either way. I should appreciate, however, a ruling by the Comptroller Gen­
 eral as to my proper place of residence from now on in order that I may be
 governed accordingly.
   It will, of course, be perfectly satisfactory to me to have my residence deter­
 mined to be, presently and until some change occurs, in either place. However,
 as long as I have the divided responsibility of two courts, I feel entitled to a
 maintenance allowance in one place or the other.
  In answer, on March 22,1941, Mr. Chandler wrote Judge Jenney
that on the basis of the information given it seemed to him plain
that the Judge's actual residence at that time was at Pasadena and
his official residence in Los Angeles. Mr. Chandler said the matter
seemed so clear that he could see no necessity for asking the Comp­
troller General for a ruling on it.
  On March 28,1941, Judge Jenney answered Mr. Chandler saying
he was entirely satisfied with Mr. Chandler's view and that he con­
curred in it. And he asked that his letter be considered as a notice
of change of residence from San Diego. He said that if he should
move back to San Diego, he would immediately notify Mr.
Chandler.
                                     65 

   Mr. Chandler agreed to this on April 7, 1941, and on April 8 he
wrote Comptroller General Lindsay C. Warren, telling him of the
October 1940 action of the Judicial Conference, and of the facts
regarding Judge Jenney's sale of his San Diego home and his move
to Pasadena. He said that on this account he and Judge Jenney
agreed that his official place of residence "is now and will continue
to be, subject to some change in conditions in the future, Los An­
geles, Calif."
   This closed the rna tter.
   Judge Cosgrave's case did not require consideration because he
retired on August 31, 1940.
   Judge Beaumont's case did not require consideration because the
statute under which he was appointed required him to have his
official residence in Fresno (Act May 31, 1938, Ch. 290; 52 Stat.
584-5, § 4 (b».
                          The Garrecht Case
   In November of 1941, Senator Homer T. Bone of Washington
questioned Mr. Chandler concerning the practice in making pay­
ments for subsistence to Federal judges generally, and particularly
to Circuit Judge Francis A. Garrecht of the Ninth Circuit for at­
tending court in San Francisco, asserting that these were made
upon a fictional rather than a factual basis since Judge GaITecht
was not truly a resident of Spokane, Washington, his designated
official residence, but of San Francisco, Calif. After conference
with Chief Justice Stone, Mr. Chandler referred the question to
Judge Curtis D. Wilbur, who was then the Chief Judge of the Ninth
Circuit.
   Judge Wilbur apparently took the matter up directly with Judge
Garrecht, who on November 14, 1941, wrote a letter directly to Sen­
ator Bone in which he explained that he was a resident at the time
of Spokane and that although the exigencies of his work on the
Court of Appeals made it necessary for him to be absent contin­
uously in San Francisco he still regarded Spokane as his actual resi­
dence and thus his "official place of residence" under the Statute.
Judge Garrecht's letter reads in substantial part as follows:
  For the benefit of all who may inquire, I am very happy to assert that I
have always been a bona fide citizen and resident of the state of Washington.
In that State I was born and also were all the members of my family; my
wife owns the farm Oil which she was born, first acquired by her parents more
than 90 years ago; while I live I expect Washington to continue to be my
residence and I am to be buried there in a plot already provided. My social
                                       66 

and such political affiliations as are presently permitted me are there; my church
and lodge affiliations are maintained there; and it may be pertinent to here
refer to the Federal Income Tax Law which requires returns and payments to
be made in the state of the taxpayer's residence, and in that connection, to
cite the fact that in conformity with the statute, my returns and payments
all go to the Tacoma office. I vote in Spokane at all state and national elec·
tions and can recall missing but a single city election in my life. I am a
part of the State of Washington, rooted in its very soil. I have been identified
with its growth and history since the days of the pioneers, to which class
my father and mother belonged. I saw the state grow from a remote outpost
into one of the great states of the Union. I was personally and politically
associated with men who framed its constitution and took some part in the
election at which it was adopted. I attended the first political convention
that was held after its ratification. I personally knew every governor the
state has ever had but one, and every senator but one, and some of them
were my warm friends. I was well acquainted with nearly every judge that
sat on the Supreme Court of my state. I have been honored by my fellow
citizens with many positions of trust and honor and no less by the IndIan tribes
of Eastern 'Yashington. A.t one of its recent commencement exercises Gonzaga
University. located at Spokane, Washington, honored me by conferring on
me its deSmet Medal, which is annually awarded to a citizen of one of the
Pacific Northwest states for outstanding service to Church and State. The
award bears eloquent witness that my own people regard me as still a citizen of
the State of Washington. There is nothing more certain than that I never had
and have not now any intention of becoming a citizen of California or of giving
up my residence in Washington.
   Moreover, many practical reasons suggest themselves why I would not want
to become a resident of California, not the least of which is the very uncertainty
of the status of this Court. You know that for the last several years there has
been more or less constant agitation for a division of the Circuit. which keeps
some of the members of the Court in a position of uncertainty as to where
the location of their court will be. The bill which you introduced very correetly
provides that automatically I would be part of the new court. From a purely
personal standpoint this would be altogether advantageous to me. I would then
become Senior Circuit .Judge and enjoy whatever distinction that position
entails; I would be able to attend the conferences held in Washington each
year; I would function nearly altogether in my home state; and nearly all of
my time would be spent there among my friends. Be assured I will go along
with my State into whatever Circuit it becomes a part.
   So much for the facts. Now, just a word as to the legal aspects of the
situation. The governing statute is Section 374, Title 28, U. S. C. A...........
When I was appointed a judge of this Court, Spokane was my residence and
pursuant to the statute, my official residence was deSignated in the Department of
Justice as Spokane, 'Yashington. Very correctly and properly I have never
changed that official residence; I have drawn for necessary expenses of travel
and maintenance only such allowances as I was clearly entitled to under the law.
   n has always been the uniform practice of judges appointed from Washington,
Oregon, Idaho, and Arizona to designate the city and state of their residence at
the time of their appointment as their official residence, and to claim their per
diem while in attendance upon the Court here and it has always been allowed
without question under exactly the same circumstances that exist in my case.
This has been the established custom since the organization of the Court and I
firmly believe that a correct interpretation of the statute has been followed.
                                       67 

   There has never been any suggestion that I am not entitled to receive the
compensation I claim. The reference to the 1940 Conference Report, alluded to
in your letter to the Administrator, concerned district judges only. As the
stenographer's notes show, the matter was very loosely considered. Investiga­
tion will show that many circuit judges in other circuits are in exactly the
same pOSition that our judges are here, and the circumstances are entirely
different from the facts considered by the Judicial Conference in 1940 relative
to district judges; indeed, some of the judges at the Conference noted some of
these distinctions.
  The Court has more hearings in San Francisco than in all the other cities
combined, which is the reason that most of our time is taken up here. Under the
rules of court the arrangement of the dockets and the aSSignment of judges to
hear the cases are made by the Senior Circuit Judge in connection with the
Clerk. DUring this last yetll" it has so happened that I have been assigned to
the hearing of cases in San Fr~:ncisco in every month. The interval between
nearly all of these hearings was so brief as to make it altogether impractical
and too expensive to be reasonable for me to return to Spokane during the period.
Wben relieved from duty I spent my time there at my office located there. The
fact that I am engaged in illY work here more of the tiille than in 'Washington,
Oregon, or anywhere else, does not deprive me of my citizenship in the State
of Washington, any more than your living in the District of Columbia nearly
all of the time forfeits your residence in Tacoma.
   I trust you will come to the conclusion that the practice followed by the cir­
cuit judges since the inception of the court is proper and accords with the intent
of the statute and that this will satisfy those who have instituted the inquiry.

  In transmitting a copy of this letter to Mr. Chandler, Judge
Wilbur wrote a separate letter dated November 19, 1941, in which
he supported Judge Garrecht's position. Judge Wilbur's letter
was as follows:
  Referring to our correspondence relative to the official place of residence of
circuit and district judges and the statemeut in relation thereto contained in the
Report of the Judicial Conference for October, 1910, particularly as it IDay con­
cern Judge Garrecht, your attention is directed to the fact that the discussion
at the Conference did not concern circuit judges, whose situation in some respects
differs from that of district judges, inasmuch as it seems to be the intention of
the law that they should be appointed from different states and be representa­
tive of such states on the bench. Moreover, at the Conference, none of the
ju!lges ga,e any consideration to the words "actual residence" and "official
residence" as applied to one in Judge Garrecht's situation.
  Evidently the use of the term "actual residence" in the statute was intended
to distingUish the appointee's residence at the time of his appointment from
the "official residence" which the appointed judge was required to designate
at the time he took office. To illustrate, had Judge Garrecht's actual resi­
dence at the time of appointment been elsewhere in the judicial district than
Spokane, the statute would nevertheless require that his "official residence" be
designated at Spokane as being the place nearest his actual residence at which
a district or circuit court was regularly held. In such a case, although the judge
may have his actual resiUence 100 miles or more distant from Spokane, he would
not receive any additional compensation for attendance upon the court on this
account and Spokane would remain his "official residence."

    It may be well to remind ourselves that the Ninth Circuit is one of magnifi­
cent distances-there is none other like it. As members of our court, we have
judges with homes in Portland, Oreg.; Boise, Idaho; Spokane, Wash.; and else­
where. It is the purpose of the law that judges should be appointed representing
different States because of their familiarity with the laws of those States which
are frequently involved in litigation before our court and it has always been
expeded, and it has been the uniform practice, that they would remain residents
of their respective States.
     Since I have been a member of this court we have had other judges from
Arizona, Idaho, Oregon and "Washington, all of whom were occupied during most
{)f each year in the hearing of cases ill San Francisco and m{)st of their time
\yas spent here and who returned to their respective States during vacations.
..-\.Il of these judges claimed allowance for travel and per diem similarly to
Judge Garrecht and the other judges from the~e States at the present time and
there never has been any question of the legality or sach claims.
     Through the efforts of Judge Denman, our Circuit secured the passage of
laws by Congres!! whereby we now have seven judges. He says that at the
time he appeared before the Congressional JudiCiary committees he told the
members that if his plea for relief of existing C'ongestion in this Circuit were
granted, he would insist that this Court discontinue the usual custom, previously
followed here as in other circuits, of not hearin£; cuses during the summer
months and that he would try to have continuous sessions throughout the
year, hearing cases during every month in ordcr that the arrearage be cleared.
To this end a rule was adopted by the court e:trectuating that proposal and since
that time and during the last two years that practice has been followed and
hearings of cases have taken place every month. Judge Garrecht, as the
 records show, has participated in hearings during every month of the year 1941.
      Our custom has been to hold court in periods for 2 or 3 weeks, continuously,
 judges alternating every other day; then a recess for a week or sometimes
 2 weeks is taken for necessary conferences and opinion writing. It is desirable
 that during this period the judges keep in close touch with one another to
 facilitate exchange of views while opinions are in preparation. If this is
 not done. it invariably results in delays in disposition of the business of the
 court.
      In the cases of Judge Garrccht and .Tudge Healy, whose official rcsidence is
 farthest away, should they return home during these short intervals between
 sittings it would require them to be on the road much of the time, besides
 greatly hindering the accomplishment of their work. In addition, it wou1d
 be far more expensive to the Government than to have them remain here
 during these intervals.
  The Senator appears to have acquiesced in the explanation
because he raised no further question.

     The Inquiry of Representatives HillillgS and Budge in 1952
  In the winter of 1952, the Administrative Office was called upon
by Representative Hillings of California and Representative Budge
of Idaho for information concerning the expenses for maintenance
in the performance of official duty incurred by the circuit judges
of the country in the calendar year 1951. Copies of the data so
furnished for each circuit were given by Mr. Chandler to the chief
                                       69 

judge of the circuit. After the information was furnished it was
discovered that some vouchers in payment of expenses had been
overlooked so that the information supplied was not altogether
complete. Revised statements were then prepared and furnished
to the members of Congress and copies for each circuit were mailed
to the chief judge of the circuit.
   Mr. Chandler then presented the matter to the Judicial Con­
ference at its special session in March of 1952 in a memorandum
reading in part as follows:
  The inquiry raised a question concerning the application of the provision of
Section 456 of Title 28 of the United States Code which provides that each
judge of the United States,
"shall, upon his certificate, be paid by the Director of the Administrative Office
of the United States Courts all necessary traveling expenses, and also his
reasonable maintenance expenses actually incurred, not exceeding $10 per day.
while attending court or transacting official bUsiness at a place other than his
offic1al station.
    •           *           •           •           *           •           •
  "The official station of each circuit and district judge, including each district
judge in the territories and possessions, shall be that place nearest his residence
at which a district court is regularly held.
  "Each circuit judge and each district judge whose official station is not fixed
expressly herein shall upon his appointment and from time to time thereafter,
as his residence may change, notify the Director of the Administrative Office of
the United States Courts in writing of his residence and official station."
  The provision quoted is substantially similar, with one difference which will
be noted later to the provision of Section 3'i4 Title 28 which was in force prior
to the revision of 1948. [Mr. Chandler's memo then outlines the prior consid­
eration of the subject by the Conference in 1940 when Judge Jenney's case
arose, and the facts of the inquiry later from Senator Bone concerning Judge
Garrecht's residence].
  The present Judicial Code would appear if anything to increase the weight to
be given to the notice by each judge of his residence and official station, and
the latitude allowed him in choosing his residence, because it omits from the
provision that the official station shall be the place "nearest his residence at
which a district court is regularly held" the word "actual" which was con­
tained in the former statute. Stin probably the opinion of the Judicial Con­
ference expressed in 1940, that to constitute "actual residence" within the mean­
ing of the statute then in force, something more than "mere legal domicile"
is necessary. still applies.
   The information furnished to members of the Congress concerning maintenance
expenses shows some instances in which circuit judges spent extended periods
of time in cities in Which courts of appeals were held and that these periods
predominated over the time that they spent at the locations which they desig­
nated as their official stations. Nevertheless it appeared that from time to
time they went back to the latter where they retained marks of residence such as
the maintenance of a dwelling, and that they did a part of their work in those
locations, even though apparently less than in the locations in which they charged
maintenance. It would not seem that in such instances there could be any rea­
sonable question that their course was in conformity with the statute which
                                        70 

appears to give to a judge a large degree of freedom in reference to his choice of
residence. Furthermore it is regarded as advantageous that between sessions
of courts of appeals, judges where conditions permit should be available for con­
sultation by persons concerned in the business of court in the parts of the circuit
which they regard as their homes.
  The question which appeared to be raised in the present inquiry by Repre­
sentatives Hillings and Budge refers to a situation in which for a very large
proportion of the year a circuit judge may charge maintenance in a place
where hE! is present and does his work on the ground that his ofllcial station
under the statute as shown by his notice is in another place, and there is a
lack of the usual indicia of residence in the latter. The last paragraph of
Section 456 of Title 28 of the United States Code appears to put the respon­
sibility for designating his residence and ofllcial station within the terms of
the statute upon <!ach circuit judge and district judge. The Administrative
Ofllce is continuing to be guided by his designation. I deem it my duty, how­
ever, to bring to the attention of the Judicial Conference the question which
appears to be raised by the members of Congress in their inquiry and what
seems to be the basis of it.
   The situation concerning the payments shown by the tabula­
tion made to circuit judges was discussed by the Conference and
conditions in respect to individual cases were explained by the
Chief Judges of the circuits concerned. No formal action was
taken by the Conference, but it was agreed that the matter would
be informally considered by the Judicial Councils of the circuits
concerned.
   After the Conference had adjourned, Judge William E. Denman,
the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
wrote to Representatives Hillings and Budge, explaining the sit­
uation in his circuit and giving its full history.
   A copy of Judge Denman's letter of May 2, 1952, follows:
   In construing the maintenance per diem statute as related to the practice
of Judge Healy, it is obviously of importance to know the practical interpreta­
 tion given the statute by judges of the Ninth Circuit Court who served at and
prior to the time he came on the bench and whose situations were the same as
or closely similar to his own. I have examined into this early practice by
consulting available records in the office of the United States Marshal at San
Francisco and by inquiry of our Clerk, who has served with the Court for nearly
50 years.
   In the last half of the 19m decade the three judges then comprising t.he court
(namely Judges Gilbert, Rudkin, and Dietrich) had each been appointed from
one or another of the outlying States of the circuit. Each had his designated
ofllcial residence througllOut his tenure in the State from which he was appointed,
one at Portland, Oreg., the second at Seattle, Wash., and the third at Boise,
Idaho. A study of the ofllcial data for a typical year (1928) shows that each
of these judges regularly collected the statutory per diem for the full time while
in attendance on the Court at San Francisco. Two of them, incidentally, would
appear to have claimed the full per diem of 10 dollars, the third, somewhat less
that that. I am reliably informed that one of them did not own during his
                                       71 

service on the court any dWelling house at his home city or official residence
These judges died in 1930 or early 1931.
   In February 1931 a successor judge (Sawtelle) from the outlying State 01
Arizona was appointed, serving until his death in 1934. His official residence
was designated as Tucson, Arizona. He regularly collected the full statutory
per diem while at San Francisco. As an example, the total maintenance allow­
ance claimed by him for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1932, was in excess of
$2,700, not including per diem while attending court at Portland and Seattle.
   In 1930 and 1935 two other judges from outlying states were appointed, namely
Judges Garrecht of Spokane and Haney of Portland. Each designated his home
city as his official residence and each uniformly collected the maintenance per
diem while at San Francisco. .Judge Garrecht served until his death in 1948;
Judge Haney until his death in 1943. I am informed that Judge Garrecht did
not during his tenure own or occupy a dwelling house at his official residence.
   Judge Healy of Boise came on the court in 1937. The records show that in
respect of the subject under inquiry he followed the settled practice of the Ninth
Circuit judges in like situations with his own as that practice prevailed at the
time of his appOintment and had prevailed for many years prior thereto. They
show, also, that during the years Judge Healy served with Judges Garrecht and
Haney, their per diem claims did not substantially differ in amount.
   The practice of these various judges whom I have mentioned cannot rationally
be considered apart from the geographical conditions obtaining in the Ninth
Circuit, as I have in other communications described those conditions to you.
lt is to be remembered, also, that for a long time past, and during much of
the time here mentioned, the volume of the work of this Court has been such
that the judges have been required during nearly the entire year to be in attend­
ance at San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, or Portland. Back in the 1920's
the first three judges mentioned found an opportunity at the close of each
quarter's session to return to their official residences. Customarily, they did
not meet in the summer months. But it will be noted that by the time Judge
Sawtelle took office, in 1932, practically continuous sessions were being held,
as they have been ever since. Thus, Judges Gilbert, Rudkin, and Dietrich, in
1928, averaged 158 days each at San Francisco, whereas Judge Sawtelle. in tne
fiscal year I have mentioned, spent 270 days there. In the succeeding years
the demands on the judges' time have steadily become more imperative, finally
reaching the point where we have been compelled to ask the Congress for two
additional circuit judges.
   I urge on you that if the subject of Judge Healy's per diems becomes a matter
of discussion, that this letter and my earlier statement to you be made a part
of the record.

  No further inquiry on the subject was made until the recent
question at the hearings on the appropriations for travel in Jan­
uary of 1953.

Hon. HENRY P. CHANDLER, Director,
      Administrative Office of the United States Courts,
          Supreme Court Building, Washington 13, D. C.
   DEAR MR. CHANDLER: I am obliged to you for your letter of
February 6th. Presumably the view expressed by the Subcom­
mittee will be considered by the members of the Judicial Confer­
ence and that an expression of policy will ensue.
   I am enclosing copy of a letter written last May by Chief Judge
Denman to Congressmen Hillings and Budge in reference to in­
quiries they were currently pursuing.'*' This letter you will find
historically informative as regards the practice in this Circuit.
The "geographical conditions" mentioned by Judge Denman on
the second page of the letter refer to problems inherent in the lines
of travel and the great distances obtaining in the Ninth Circuit,
making it impracticable as well as wasteful of time and public
money for distantly located judges to repair to their official sta­
tions in the brief intervals between calendars. As a personal
illustration, it requires practically two days to travel from San
Francisco to Boise, Idaho, whether by train or automobile, and a
like time to return.
   I desire not to be understood as suggesting that these considera­
tions are determinative of the matter of policy. The interests of
the federal judiciary as a whole will probably be adversely affected
by perpetuation of the differences with the Subcommittee. I feel
that these interests are paramount, and I am prepared to go along
with such solution as may be proposed by spokesmen for the Con­
ference more closely in touch with the situation. In the mean­
time I shall conform to the views of the Appropriations Subcom­
mittee as respects subsistence claims while in attendance on the
Court at San Francisco.
  "Set out in full in appendix II, p. 70, supra.

  I would be happy to have you pass along this communication
and the enclosed letter to members of the Conference with whom
you are in contact. I have already supplied Chief Judge Denman
with copies of the exchanges between you and myself, together
with a copy of this letter.
  With my very kind regards, I remain

  UNITED STATES CoURT     OF   ApPEALS, NINTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
                      SAN FRANCISCO 3, CALIF., ~March 10, 1953.
Chambers of William Healy, United States Circuit Judge
Hon. HENRY P. CHANDLER,
     Director, Administrative Office of the United States Courts,
          Supreme Court Building, Washington 13, D. C.
   DEAR MR. CHANDLER: This is in response to your request for
information bearing on my residence at Boise.
   I became a resident of Idaho in 1908 following upon my gradua­
tion from the Iowa University law school in that year. I prac­
ticed law at Silver City, Idaho, for several years, or until the end
of 1913, when, after a term in the legislature, I removed to Boise
and thereafter practiced in that city. My wife is a native of Idaho
and our children were born and grew up in Boise. My older
daughter was a student at the University of Idaho from 1934
through 1936.
   Upon my appointment to the circuit bench in 1937 I designated
Boise as my official residence. Subsequent to my going on the
bench my wife and I have continued, as before, to be registered
at the Boise polls and have regularly voted there at all general
elections. I did not own a dwelling house in Boise at the time of
my appointment, having disposed of my home there about 2 years
before because it had ceased to be adequate for our purposes.
I have not since acquired a dwelling house at San Francisco or
elsewhere. At San Francisco we have lived in part at a hotel but
most of the time in rented apartments.
   At the time of my appointment I took over offices in the Federal
building at Boise which had some years before been set apart
for the accommodation of the United States circuit judge. These
are adequate quarters, fully furnished, and equipped with a law
                                74 

library supplied by the Government. I keep there also my private
law library. These quarters I have regularly occupied and used
at all times when in Boise, and have written many opinions there.
   Subsequent to my appointment I continued to pay the full
amount of the Idaho State income tax as a resident. The State
of California also exacted from me, as from other out-of-State
judges, their tax assessed against nonresidents upon income earned
in California. About 1941, as I recall, the Idaho legislature passed
a reciprocal law relieving residents from tax on income earned in
other States. Since 1942 my Idaho income tax has been small
inasmuch as my salary has very largely been earned in other States
of the circuit. My Federal returns are made to the Boise collector.
   In the early years of my tenure on the court we were able to
spend much of the summer at Boise, staying while there at the
hotel Boise or in rented quarters at the Wellman Apartments.
Growth in the volume of court business and the development of
the practice of holding regular calendars at San Francisco through­
out the entire year rendered it impracticable in most years there­
after to spend much time in Idaho. My wife and I have always
regarded Boise as our home and intend on my retirement to return
there permanently.
   There is another aspect of my practice which may be thought
to have little bearing on the question of residence, but which does
throw light on my continued interest in my home State and my
desire to be helpful there. As you are aware there is but one
judge in the Idaho district and the business there has become very
heavy during the last 2 decades. Throughout my tenure on the
circuit bench I have at intervals tried many cases in the Idaho
district court at Boise and Pocatello at the request of Judge Clark
or his predecessor, Judge Cavanah. These have included both
court and jury cases, civil and criminal. The contribution I have
made and am making in this respect has not been a mere nominal
or token gesture, but.a substantial service, productive, I think, of
important results in the periodical easing of the heavy burden
resting on the Idaho judge. As you may surmise this work has at
times cut heavily into my supposed vacations.
   I am enclosing for your convenience a copy of this letter.
   With kind regards, I am
        Courteously yours,
                                           WILLIAM HEALY,
                                   United States Circuit Judge.

Hon. ORIE L. PHILLIPS,
     United States Court of Appeals, Denver, Colo.
  Your letter of April 8 re Judicial Conference meeting has just
been received by me at Seattle where we are hearing an extensive
calendar which will not conclude until Wednesday of next week.
  I have with me here a copy of a factual statement submitted to
the General Accounting Office at its request on March 13. This
covers the matters you mention. Copies of this statement were
at that time furnished also to Director Chandler and to Judge
Denman. Since the time is too short to get a copy of this state­
ment in your hands at Denver I will mail it to you at the Drake
Hotel, Chicago.

 UNITED STATES COURT OF ApPEALS, NINTH JUDICIAL CmCUIT
                      SAN FRANCISCO 3, CALIF., April   ~O,   1953.
Chambers of William Healy, United States Circuit Judge.
Judge ORIE L. PHILLIPS,
     United States Court of Appeals, 

         Drake Hotel, Chicago, Ill. 

My DEAR JUDGE: Pursuant to my wire of April 17 in response to
your letter, I enclose a copy of the statement which I submitted
to the General Accounting Office on March 13 at its request. As
indicated in the wire, copies of this statement were at that time
furnished also to Director Chandler and to Chief Judge Denman.
The only material not included in the enclosed copy are the graphs
mentioned on page 7 of the statement showing the dates on which
cases were calendared during the year 1951 and indicating those
in which I personally sat. I do not have available here at Seattle
either exemplars of the graphs or copies of the 1951 calendars.
However, copies of the graphs were attached to the copy of the
statement submitted to Director Chandler and I believe also to
Judge Denman's copy.
  I assume, although I have no definite information to that effect,
that the General Accounting Office has made a report to the Senate
Judiciary Committee or to Senator McCarran on my status inas­
                                77 


much as, according to the press, the GAO was asked by Senator
McCarran to make inquiry and to report on that matter in the
course of a committee hearing held on March 7, 1953. I would
think that the nature of the report, if one has been made, would
be of interest to the Judicial Conference.
   There is one phase of your letter of April 8 that I desire to com­
ment on, and I trust that my comments will be called to the at­
tention of the committee and the conference as well. You state
that whether my "actual" residence is at Boise has been called in'
question; and, again, that it is desired that I give your committee
the pertinent facts upon which I claim that Boise is my "actual"
residence.                         '
   I assume that your employment of the adjective "actual" was
not an inadvertence but that it perhaps indicates your interpre­
tation of the pertinent statute as it existed prior to 1948, and
as rephrased in the latter year. I have not thought that the ap­
pearance of the word in the former statute carried any significance
as relates to the point now under discussion. Nor did Judges Gar­
recht of Spokane or Judge Haney of Portland, who were serving
on the court when I became a member, attach significance
to it; and I gathered that a like view was entertained at least by
Judge Rudkin of Washington and Judge Sawtelle of Arizona who
had served earlier.
    The old statute used the term "official residence," defining it
as that place nearest the judge's actual residence at which a dis­
 trict court, etc., was regularly held. The employment in juxta­
 position of the term "residence" in both phrases rendered the
 definition an awkward one to state unless some distinguishing
 word such as "actual," or "real," were used to distinguish between
 the two kinds of residence. A glance at the old statute will re­
 veal this clumsiness. That the word "actual" was thought by
 Congress to serve no other purpose than a grammatical one is
 demonstrated, I think, by the fact that it was dropped from the
 statute when the phrase "official station" was substituted for
 "official residence." The 1948 codifiers indicated that no change
 in meaning was intended by the changes in phraseology, hence it

 a grammatical sense, was purposely omitted.

   UNITED STATES COURT OF ApPEALS. NINTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT

                          SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF.,   March 13,1953.
Chambers of William Healy, United States Circuit Judge
Mr. MORRIS   H.   KNEE,
      General Accounting Office, 

           Washington, D. C. 

    DEAR MR. KNEE: In response to your request I am furnishing
 the following with certain material appended thereto.
    I became a resident of Idaho in 1908 following my graduation
 from the Iowa University law school in that year. I was admitted
 to the bar and practiced law at Silver City, Idaho, for several years,
 or until the end of 1913, when, after a term in the legislature, I
removed to Boise. There I continued in the active private practice
except for 3 years during which I served as general counsel of the
}i'arm Credit Administration of Spokane. In the period 1930 to
1933 I was a member of the Idaho State Bar Commission and
served as president of the State Bar Association. I understand
that since going on the bench I have continued to be carried on the
rolls of that association as a member, since notification of its
 annual meetings have ordinarily been mailed me. I have at­
tended several of these meetings when in the State at the time.
The Idaho bar is what is known as an integrated bar, and prac­
ticing lawyers are obliged by law to be members of it and to pay
into the State treasury an annual license fee of $10. Idaho Code,
1947, volume 2, § 3-409 provides for this, but excepts "State and
United States judges of the courts of record within this State"
from the payment of the license fee. As a United States circuit
judge who acts at times, as I do, as a United States district judge
within the State the provisions of the act are not clear. Section
3-405 of the Code, in defining those who are members of the Idaho
State bar states that "all judges of the district and supreme courts
of this State, and of the district court of the United States for
Idaho" are members of the Idaho bar. At the time of my appoint­
ment I was a member of the State bar as membership is defined in
the statute, having continued at all times since the enactment of
the legislation to. comply with the requirements of the act. I
should add that I have never been a member of nor affiliated with
the bar of any State other than Idaho since I came to that State in
1908 up to the present.
   Prior to 1920 I was for several years a member of the State Board
                                 79 

of Education and of the board of regents of the University of
Idaho. In 1933 I was elected a member of the Idaho State con­
vention which ratified the repeal of the eighteenth amendment.
   My wife is a native of Idaho and our two daughters were born
and grew up in Boise. The latter, on their mother's side, are
Idahoans of the fourth generation, their great grandparents having
been among the founders of Silver City.
   Upon taking the oath as circuit judge in 1937 I designated Boise
as my official residence. Subsequent to that time my wife and I
have continued, as before, to be registered at the Boise polls and
have regularly voted there at all general elections, usually by ab­
sentee ballot. Consult Idaho Code, 1947, volume 6, § 34-1021, as
to residence. Consult also District of Columbia v. Murphy, 314 U.
S. 441. Parenthetically, we have been registered and have voted
in the same precinct in Boise from 1915 to date. I have not voted
at any election nor been registered as a voter in any State other than
Idaho since coming there in 1908, nor has roy wife ever voted or been
registered as a voter in any State other than Idaho.
   I did not own a dwelling house in Boise at the time of my appoint­
ment, and have not since acquired a dwelling house at San Fran­
cisco or elsewhere. At San Francisco we have had our living
quarters at times at a hotel but during the bulk of the time have
occupied various rented apartments. At present we occupy a
rented apartment at 26 West Fourth Avenue in San Mateo. My
wife owns real and personal property in Idaho, inherited from
her mother. I own no real property anywhere.
   At the time of my appointment I took over offices in the Federal
building at Boise which had some years before been set apart
for the accommodation of the United States Circuit judge. These
are adequate quarters, fully furnished, and equipped with a law
library supplied by the government, plus supplies and official and
private files. I keep there also my private law library, which is
of considerable proportions. These quarters I have regularly oc­
cupied and used at all times when in Boise, and have written many
opinions there.
   Subsequent to my appointment, when Federal judicial salaries
were opened to local taxation, I continued to pay the full amount
of the rather heavy Idaho State income tax as a resident. The
State of California also exacted from me, as from other outstate
judges, its tax assessed against nonresidents upon income earned in
California. About 1941, as I recall, the Idaho legislature passed
                                80 

a reciprocal law relieving residents from tax on income earned in
other States. Because of this legislation my Idaho income tax,
which I have since paid annually as a resident, has been reduced
proportionately and is not very large. My Federal returns are
made to the Boise collector.
   In the early years of my tenure on the court we were able to
spend much of the summer and early autumn at Boise, living while
there at the Hotel Boise or more generally in rented quarters at
the Wellman Apartments. Growth in the volume of court business
and the development of the practice of holding regular calendars
throughout the year rendered it impracticable in most of the years
thereafter to spend a great deal of time in Idaho, although I have
continued to be there for varying periods each year during my
tenure. This situation will be more fully gone into at another
place. My wife and I have always regarded Boise as our home
and intend on my retiremen t to return there permanently. Though
necessarily away the great bulk of the time, we have maintained
our old ties and associations with friends and acquaintances in the
city and over the State. I have never been much of a iljoiner,"
and have not for well over 20 years been a member of any lodge
or fraternal order in Idaho. Nor have I become affiliated with any
such organization in any other State.
   There is another aspect of my life as a judge which appears to
me worth mentioning since it throws light on my continued attach­
ment to my home State and my desire to be helpful there. The
Idaho Federal district has but one judge, and its business has grown
very heavy during the last two decades. At intervals during the
period of my tenure on the circuit bench I have tried many cases
in the Federal district court for Idaho at Boise or Pocatello at the
request of Judge Clark or his predecessor, Judge Cavanah, who
retired I believe about 1942. These have included both court and
jury cases, civil and criminaL At the moment there are three
pending cases assigned to me in that district, one of which was
partly but not wholly concluded last year. The contribution I
have made over the years in this respect has been substantial and,
I think, productive of benefit to the State, more particularly in
the periodical easing of the heavy burden resting on the Idaho
judge. This work has usually been done at a considerable sacrifice
of my supposed vacations. Except in my own case, it has not in
my time been the practice of the ninth circuit judges to do trial
work in the district courts.
                                        81 

    I have earlier spoken of the increase in the volume of the court's
business since I came on the bench and to the growth of the practice
of calendaring cases regularly the year round. The circuit court,
you no doubt understand, sits in other places than San Francisco,
inasmuch as the statute requires the holding of terms also at Port~
land, Seattle, and Los Angeles. I append a graph showing the
days on which cases were calendared during the year 1951, and
another indicating those on which I personally sat.l Usually the
court hears two cases per day. A particular judge is ordinarily
assigned to sit on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of one week
and on Tuesday and Thursday of the next, although that custom
varies considerably with the circumstances and the membership
of the court available.
   In a letter of Chief Judge Denman, copy of which I append for
your information with his permission, he refers to the "geographical
conditions obtaining in the Ninth Circuit." *' By this he doubtless
had reference to problems inherent in the lines of travel and the
great distances obtaining in the circuit, making it impracticable
and wasteful of time and public money for distantly located judges
to repair to their official stations in the intervals between calendars.
In my case it takes the better part of 2 days to travel from San
Francisco to Boise, whether by train or auto, and a like time to
return. 2 Between calendars the time of the judge is normally
devoted to the study of submitted cases and to the onerous work
of writing opinions. If he does this work at his official station it
is necessary for him to take along his secretary and ordinarily his
law clerk to aid in these tasks. In addition to the travel expense
of the judge there is to be considered the travel and subsistence
expenses of his attaches. (The latter allowances are $8 per day
for each.) For these several reasons the distantly located judges
have not in my time gone to their official stations between the
recurring sessions, as may be the practice of judges in geographi­
('ally smaller circuits or those of the Ninth whose official stations
are not far removed from San Francisco. In these years of heavy
calendars we find, too, that the cases are disposed of more expediti­
ously when the judges remain together, so that they may the more

readily confer and iron out differences of opinion. You will find
the letter of Chief Judge Denman historically informative on this
general subject. As already stated, I am appending a copy of his
letter.*
   It may be proper to add that I have not spared myself as re­
gards participation in these recurring sessions or sought to escape
the routine drudgery of the court. As to the latter I may say
that, apart from calendared cases, in most days a varying grist of
uncalendared matters passes over my desk for consideration and
disposition by myself in conjunction usually with two other judges.
   Perhaps the statement of these conditions may afford an under­
standing of the reasons why an outstate judge like myself is so
much away from his official station in attendance upon the court
or in the performance of judicial business.
   I have never doubted that the statute defining the official station
of circuit judges applies to my situation and warrants in letter
and spirit, the practice I have followed in claiming subsistence al­
lowance in the varying amounts certified by me through the years.
I consider it, and always have considered it, fair and just as well
as lawful that I should claim those amounts. My appraisal of
the law found support in the opinion and practice of the judges,
in like situations with myself, who were serving on the bench
when I came here, and in the obtainable information concerning
the practice of deceased judges in like situation who had served in
earlier periods. The appended letter of Judge Denman * contains
rather full and detailed information concerning this matter.
  If there is additional information which the accounting office
desires I shall be happy to furnish it if I have it.
        Courteously yours,

  UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF ApPEALS, NINTH JUDICIAL 

                         CIRCUIT 

                         SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF., March 17, 1963
Chambers of William Healy, United States Circuit Judge
Mr. MORRIS H. KNEE,
    General Accounting Office, 

        Washington, D. C. 

   DEAR MR. KNEE: In my statement handed to you a few days
ago I overlooked inserting a citation to a recent decision of the
Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Murphy, 314 U. S. 441,
dealing with a kindred situation. This citation should have been
inserted on page 3, line 12, where reference was made in my state­
ment to the Idaho statute relating to residence.
   There was another matter that I had intended to refer to but
overlooked in my hurry because of your desire to have the state­
ment promptly. In Senator Welker's reference to the amount of
my per diem he used the figures for the calendar year 1951. Our
court year is not the calendar year but the fiscal year, and statistics
of all kinds are compiled on the basis of the latter. I think a fairer
picture would have been presented, if, instead of using data cover­
ing half of two fiscal years, the whole of the figures for the two
fiscal years involved were used. I have before me the data for
the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1950, and ending June 30, 1951,
which Director Chandler sent me. These show per diem col­
lected in the amount of $3,340. The figures for the fiscal year
beginning July 1, 1951, and ending June 30, 1952, obtained from
my own files, show a total claimed for that year of $3,230. I should
perhaps add that in the calendar year 1951 I had no assignments
for any district court matters at Boise. However, I had agreed
at the request of Judge Clark to take over several cases in which he
deemed himself disqualified or preferred not to sit. These cases
had been set for trial at Boise during February 1952, and I went up
to try them in that month returning there again for a few days in
March.
   I would be happy if you would forward this additional matter
to Washington.
        Yours sincerely,
                                            (S) WILLIAM HEALY.

Hon. QRIE L. PHILLIPS,
               Denver 1, Colo.
  Your letter April 8 just caught up with me this morning at
Seattle where we are holding court. Am having some material
sent you by air mail from San Francisco today. John Biggs has
copy of letter of April 10 to Congressman Metcalf and both Mon­
tana Senators have copies letter. Contains a full statement of
claim to residence. Mister Chandler also has a complete file of
material from me. Will be on the bench here through April 22
at Missoula on the 23d and will hold court Helena on 24th. Re­
turning to San Francisco on the 27th.

               Washington 13, D. C. 

  DEAR MR. CHANDLER: I have your telegram requesting for the
Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee a state­
ment of the number of days in which I sat in court in the calendar
year 1951.
   I have wired you that I would send you by air mail some infor­
mation to disclose that the demands of the calendar here are such
that I do not have the opportunity which the circuit judges of
some other circuits do to spend a substantial portion of my time
at my official station. I am enclosing a 1951 calendar which dis­
closes the days in which this court sat during that year. Those
days are circled in red. * Generally speaking, you will notice that
there is never a period of more than one week when cases are not
being heard.
  * The days thus referred to are horizontally lined out in the reproduction of
the calendar which follows the telegram on p. 87.
                                     (85)
                                86 

   Of course I did not sit on every day circled on this calendar.
The pattern generally is that I will sit on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday of one week and Tuesday and Thursday of another week.
I will endeavor to mark on another calendar and send to you the
precise days on which I personally participated in hearings. At
any rate you will note that there is no opportunity for me to travel
to Montana between sittings.
   So far I have been able to arrange with my associates to spend
JUly and August in Missoula where I use the district court cham­
bers and carryon my work. I111951, I remained at Missoula dur­
ing September also.
   I think it should be understood also that on almost every day
when I am in San Francisco, whether I am on the bench or not,
there are orders to be signed not involving arguments in open court
but which require prompt action. I think my associates would
object to an arrangement whereby I might spend alternate months
in San Francisco and at Missoula. For one thing it would inter­
fere with our system of frequent conferences with respect to cases
submitted. But if this alternate month system could be arranged,
it would entail additional transportation costs not only for me but
for my law clerk and secretary, and each of them would be entitled
to per diem while in Missoula in these alternate months. I think
it is apparent that such a plan would prove more costly than the
present one.
        Sincerely,
                                                WALTER L. POPE.

HENRY   P. CHANDLER:
   Retel I sat in this court 72 days in calendar year 1951. These
are the days in which causes were argued in open court 2A Divi­
sion of which I was a member. This does not include numerous
other days on which I have participat€d in making orders upon
a.pplications not receiving argument or presentation in open court.
I think I also sat in 1 and perhaps 2 three-judge cases in District
Court at Los Angeles the records of which are not immediately
available but will send supplemental wire on that as soon as records
can be checked. That would add possibly two more days. For
your information in checking travel expenses against the days in
court it should be borne in mind that calendars here are so ar­
ranged that I have neither time nor opportunity to return to

                              SAN FRANCISCO, February 5,1953.
HENRY P. CHANDLER:
  Supplementing my telegram of yesterday I find there were two
additional dates when I sat in court occasioned by two separate
assignments at Los Angeles. Also note that three meetings of our
Judicial Council in 1951 which I attended were on days when
no court session was held. Portions of the amount paid me in
1951 covered days when this court sat in Los Angeles. Your rec­
ords do not disclose this because all my per diem was collected
through the San Francisco marshal.
                                     (S) WALTER L. POPE,
                                                Circuit Judge.
  Received 3:25 p. m., February 5,1953.
       UNITED STATES COURT OF ApPEALS, NINTH CIRCUIT
                   SAN FRANCISCO 1, CALIF., February 12, 1953.
Chambers of Walter L. Pope, United States Circuit Judge
Mr. HENRY P. CHANDLER,
     Director, Administrative Office U. S. Court8,
          Supreme Court Building, Wa8hington 13, D. C.
   DEAR MR. CHANDLER: I thank you for your letter advising of
the inquiries of the Appropriations subcommittee which led to
the sending of your telegram concerning the days when I sat
on the bench.
   The committee's suggestion that the problem be handled by
the judiciary is a sound one. To my mind, that would mean a
recommendation by the Judicial Conference, after study by a com­
mittee. While I think the committee's views may change when
it gets a more complete picture (some facts it should have are
mentioned later herein), yet I propose now, and of my own mo­
tion, to conform to what I understand the committee's present
ideas are. Thus I take it that if I were to follow the plan of some
judges of spending, say, every other month at my home, and
less than half my total time at San Francisco, no fault would be
found with my collecting per diem for days at San Francisco thus
computed.
   While I cannot, consistent with the way this court operates, as
I explained in my former letter, actually absent myself from San
Francisco any more than I have done in the past, yet there cannot
be any just objection if my collections for subsistence at San Fran­
                                 89 

cisco are in amount no more than if I were at Mi880ula more than
half the time. (And note that I would continue to be one ot
the smallest consumers of transportation requests.)
   Therefore, beginning with fiscal 1953, I shall limit my col­
lection for subsistence at San Francisco to 180 days in any 1
fiscal year, and I shall continue that way until either Congress,
the Judicial Conference, some committee thereof, or other appro­
priate official body figures out a better plan.
   The House Committee, I judge, has only the figures made up by
you a year ago for Congressmen Budge and Hillings, relating to
subsistence costs only and for the calendar year 1951. As a key
to what the travel expenses of the various judges are, or as to
which judges cost the most, it is wholly inadequate. These partial
figures of travel cost make it appear that two judges of the Ninth
Circuit are the most expensive ones, followed next by two judges
of the Seventh. The complete figures may disclose that such
is not the case. To illustrate, Judge A of the Z circuit lives and has
his official station at Middleburg. The court sits at Court City.
He spends July and August at Middleburg; the remainder of the
year he works, 3 weeks at Court City followed by 3 weeks at Mid­
dleburg, and so on through the year. If I were one of the com­
mittee I would be curious to know: (1) What is the round trip rail
or plane fare between the two places? (2) Does the judge have
the benefit of his secretary and law clerk at Middleburg only, or at
Court City, only, or does he take them back and forth with him?
 (3) What does their travel cost? (4) If they do go back and forth,
do they each draw per diem for subsistence at Middleburg, or at
 Court City? When all these items are added to what Judge A
 collects for his subsistence, what does it amount to? Until the
 committee is furnished all these costs, it will not have the full
 picture.
   That the matter is not simple becomes apparent when one
 analyzes the committee's suggestion that a charge should not be
 made for subsistence at the seat of the court when a judge spends
 "the greater part of the time" there. Thus Judge A, previously
 mentioned, would spend less than half of his time at the seat of
 the court. If he is typical, he owns his home at Middleburg, just
 as I own mine at Missoula. My home, although occupied part
 of the year only, is, like his, fully furnished and always ready for
 occupancy when I am at my official station. Now when we are
 at the seat of the court, each of us must rent a place to stay. I
                                  90 

have no idea what this costs Judge A, but I know that just a place
to stay, without including food, heat, light, or anything other than
housing costs me $3,400 a year.
   I assume that no one will suggest that under these circumstances
it is just that I should charge nothing simply because I am com­
pelled, for the reasons explained in my former letter to be here, say,
three-fourths of the time. When some action on this matter is
taken, I hope this consideration will not be overlooked.
   I think there is sound reason for the present rule which estab­
lishes the judge's official station (subject to his right to change it),
at a place near his residence. It maintains a desirable contact be­
tween the judge and the people of his State. It equalizes the situ­
ation of the home-owning judge coming from a distance with that
of the judge who lives where the court sits. I think the circuit
judges generally would like to see that provision retained.
   My previous procedure has but followed precisely what my
predecessors on this court from the States of Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, and Arizona, have done for the past 30 years. In view of
what my housing arrangements cost me, as stated above, I do not
share the committee's views but I am prompted to adopt the plan
I have here undertaken primarily by my desire to do away with any
discussion which may cause any criticism of the courts.
        Sincerely,
                                             WALTER L. POPE,
                                                      Circuit JUdge.

   EXCERPTS FROM LETTER FROM JUDGE WALTER L. POPE TO
                     f[ONORABLE LEE METCALF
                                                      APRIL   9, 1953.
   * * * The section relating to the allowances to judges is 456 of
title 28. I t took this form at the time of the revision and reenact­
ment of title 28 in 1948, but in substance it is the same as the sec­
tion which it superseded and which was enacted as a part of the old
judicial code of 1911. If you will examine it you will see that
it makes Missoula, Mont., my official station as it provides that
the official station of each circuit judge shall be "that place nearest
his residence at which a district court is regularly held." I think
that it is generally understood by the lawyers in Montana
that I have been anxious to take advantage of this provision for
each summer; for two or three months, I set up headquarters in
Judge Murray's chambers at Missoula and there work all summer
with the aid of my law clerk and secretary writing opinions and
doing other paper work connected with my office.
   It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that I am thus permitted
to take my assistants to Missoula, where I have full use of the
University law library which is a better law library than this court
has here, and where I can live in my own home. The incidental
advantages of a summer in Montana are as well known to you as
tome.
   I have also taken advantage of other provisions of the same sec­
tion which provide that while I am attending court or transacting
official business at a place other than my official station, e. g., at
San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, or Portland, I am entitled to
subsistence not exceeding the statutory per diem. When I first
joined the court I was advised by the clerk and by others of the
fact that all of the judges of this court for many years past, other
than those whose residences were at or near San Francisco, have
claimed the per diem when away from their official stations. This
was not only true of the early day judges from Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, and Arizona, such as Rudkin, Gilbert, Haney, Dietrich,
and Sawtelle, but it has been true of the later and present judges
buch as Garrecht, Bone, both from Washington; Mathews, formerly
from Arizona; and Orr, formerly from Nevada. However, in the
case of a few of the judges, they sold and disposed of their homes
at their original official station and thereafter, perhaps because
they had some question as to whether they thereby lost their origi­
nal residences and hence their official station, they ceased to collect
their per diem while in attendance at San Francisco.
   This was true of three of our present judges, Mathews, Bone, and
Orr. At some period after he was appointed to this court, Judge
Mathews disposed of his Phoenix, Ariz., residence and built him­
self a home in San Francisco and gave formal notice of change of
residence to San Francisco. Prior to that time he collected the per
diem for periods when he was at San Francisco. Likewise Judges
Bone and Orr when they first joined the court in 1944 and 1945,
and for a few years thereafter, collected the per diem for attendance
at San Francisco as each then owned his home in the State from
which he came. When thereafter they sold their homes they
ceased making the claims for the per diem when at San Francisco.
In other words, all of them while they were situated as I am fol­
lowed the practice which I have pursued in this matter.

   * * * As you probably know, my house stands ready for my
 occupancy every day of the year, even the furnace is not turned
 off in the winter; I occupy it a substantial number of days in the
 year, I keep up all my local church and lodge memberships and
 have always declared my intention to return whenever possible.
    * * * As a measure of what an individual judge costs the gov­
 ernment in travel expense the figures are most misleading as
 the typical circuit judge is constantly driving back and forth not
 only himself but with his law clerk or secretary, or both. In many
instances there is a 3-fold railroad or transportation expense, for
whenever the law clerk or secretary is away from his or her official
 station, they draw per diem also.
    The reason that judges of the Ninth Circuit, with some excep­
 tions, have not been able to follow the usual practice of going
home every month, or even every week, is that the distances are
too far and our calendars too continuous. The pattern of our
calendars is that the court sits for 2 weeks followed by an interval
of 1 week. If in that interval I started for Missoula I would get
there in time to get the next train back.
    * * * An additional circumstance which I think is of major
importance is that the amounts that I have collected by way of
per diem at San Francisco have represented amounts which I am
actually out of pocket. By that I do not mean amounts I spend
for groceries, heat, light, and meals which I would have to pur­
chase wherever I happen to be. I refer to the cost of providing
at San Francisco an additional place to sleep and eat and stay when
I am here. I am obliged to rent housing accommodations here
and to have suitable ones I have to rent by the year. That cost
me $2,424 per annum. I had to furnish these quarters at a cost
of $7,000 and the annual depreciation is reasonably $700. I have
to employ someone to assist in the care of the place which cost
$300 more; this means that I am actually out of pocket in these
respects $3,424 per annum which is more than I have ever collected
in per diem.
   The sum of the matter is as follows: I have conscientiously
followed the statute both in letter and spirit and I have pursued
the practice followed by every judge in this court coming from
a distant State for at least the last 25 years and the amounts paid
to me represent less than the amount I have actually been out of
pocket.
   * * * The main reason I would like to see the present provision

being able to continue to take my staff to Montana for the sum­
mer. If they want to put a maximum limit on the per diem I
can collect here at San Francisco, e. g., providing that it cannot
exceed half the days of the year, or must have some relation to
the actual number of days I am on the bench, that is all right with
me. Something similar to that I assume is inevitable at the very
least.
   * * * Certainly the procedures have been unchallenged for
many years and Congress undoubtedly intended to provide that
the judges might keep their official stations at their homes in order
to make their tasks more pleasant. It is in line with the practice
of providing the judges with convenient and pleasant quarters.
The fact that the Montana judge cannot go home every week or
every month because of the distance limitation should not work
to his disadvantage. Had I made it a practice of spending alter­
nate months at home throughout the year, as many judges do, my
per diem at San Francisco would have been much less, but the
cost of hauling me and my staff back and forth would have been
something for the books, although I would never have been men­
tioned under the present circumstances.

Hon. QRIE L. PHILLIPS,
      Chief Judge, U. S. Court of Appeals,
           The Drake Hotel, Chicago, Ill.
   My home located approximately 9 miles west of Missoula is a
two-story stone and frame structure consisting of six rooms plus
two complete bathrooms. It has an almost full basement, and
there is also a completely finished and furnished bedroom above
the garage. It is heated by an automatically controlled furnace
which is never turned off whether I am there or not. The appoint­
ments of the house are extraordinarily attractive with great fire­
place, beautiful paneling, and plank floors of wide Tennessee oak.
It is completely furnished, as all the furniture I had when I joined
the court has remained there. Also there, and continuously kept
there, are complete supplies of linens, bedding, tablecloths, nap­
kins, dishes, silverware, and extra clothing of myself and Mrs.
Pope. We have our own water system supplied from springs, and
the running water is never cut off even during my absence, the same
is true of the electric current, used for cooking, and the telephone.
                                 94 


Mrs. Pope and I can walk into the house on any day in the year,
push up the thermostat, and be completely at home, as we even
keep on hand canned goods, flour, sugar, and other foods. In
1952 we occupied the house from June 20 to September 1. In
195,l from July 3 to October 5 or 12, just which I cannot verify
today. In no year since on the court have I occupied the house
less than 2 months.
   In one earlier year Mrs. Pope and I came home a month earlier,
and she remained while I returned to Los Angeles for the Judges
Conference following which I returned here. The total time that
year was 3 months, not counting the interruption mentioned.
When I am not here no one occupies the house. The house is
located on a tract of 360 acres, most of it hill pasture land, where
my saddle horses are kept the year around. There is a small tenant
house on the place where a young couple live and receive free
use of the small house and barn and chicken house and free use of
a small amount of tillable land. For this they act as caretaker
and water and mow my lawn. My telephone rings in their house.
Last summer a neighbor lost his house when it was struck by
lightning and burned down, and I allowed him and his wife t<r
stay in my house while they were arranging to build. They were
there as guests, and not as tenants. They are now in California
where I understand they have purchased a home. This is the only
time anyone other than my family has ever occupied the house. I
am an officer, and holder of one-third of the stock of Hammond
Building, Inc., a Missoula corporation owning one of the largest
business rental properties in downtown Missoula, and I also own
individually a downtown business building which I lease. These
holdings require substantial management duties on my part. I
have a bank account in the local bank, am an active member of
the Missoula Kiwanis Club, and since I joined the court I have con­
tinued and increased my financial contributions to the local church
of which I am an active member. Mrs. Pope buys most of her
clothes in the Missoula stores. In fact that is exactly what she
was doing, and showing me her purchases, when they tried to
deliver your telegram. Interesting is the fact tha,t this is so well
known to people here that they knew where to look for her, and
thus finally found me. The maintenance of this home is an objec­
tive not only for myself, but is part of the provision I seek to
make for my wife in case anything should happen to me. * * *

Home address: Hillsboro, Ill.
Hon. OBIE L. PHILLIPS,
      Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals, 

           Tenth Circuit, Denver 1, Colo. 

   DEAR JUDGE PHILLIPS: This is in response to your letter of
April 8, as chairman of the committee appointed by the Chief
Justice, relative to certain practices pursued in connection with
Section 456, Title 28 United States Code. I am enclosing copies
so that they may be furnished other members of your committee,
if you so desire.
   Your first and most important request is that I furnish "perti­
nent facts" to show that Hillsboro, Ill., is my actual residence. I
was born and reared in Montgomery County, of which Hillsboro is
the county seat. Upon admission to the bar I established Hills­
boro as my residence and commenced the practice of law in 1911.
I was married in 1913, and have owned a home in Hillsboro con­
tinuously since that date. I have never lived any place else, even
temporarily, except when away from Hillsboro in official positions,
which includes my judicial tenure! and three terms and part of a
fourth in the United States House of Representatives (I was serv­
ing my fourth term when I resigned in 1933 to accept appointment
to the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois). At
that time I had a law office in Hillsboro which I used while on the
District Court.
   In Apri11937, I was appointed a member of this Court of Ap­
peals. I continued to maintain my law office in Hillsboro until
1948 and did considerable of my judicial work there. In that year
I turned over the office, library, furniture, and equipment to Mr.
Paul Hickman, a young attorney, who still occupies the office, but
it is available for my use when I so desire. I still own the contents
of the office and pay taxes assessed thereon. I own and have lived
with my family in my present home since 1920, which of course is
                                (96)
                                  97 

completely furnished. 1 also own a farm 4 miles from Hillsboro
which is operated on a share basis. My income tax return has
always been filed at Springfield, Ill. (Hillsboro is in that district).
1 own stock in the bank in Hillsboro and retain my membership
there in four fraternal lodges. }vIy wife and I are members of and
contribute to the church there; also, all our contributions to chari­
table organizations, such as the Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc.,
are made there. I have never cast a vote any place other than at
Hillsboro. 1 am a member in good standing (pay dues) of the
Montgomery County Bar Association, and have been since its
organization a member of the Montgomery County Farm Bureau.
I pay a Hillsboro wheel tax on my automobile and I am issued a
license by the State of Illinois as a resident of Hillsboro.
   Certainly there can be no question but that Hillsboro was my
actual residence and that Springfield (the nearest place of a Dis­
trict Court) automatically became my official residence at the
time I was appointed to this court. I could not at that time, if
I had so desired, made even a colorable claim that my residence
was elsewhere. The only question that possibly could arise is
whether in the interim I have changed my actual residence and
failed to notify the administrator. So I will now give you the other
side of the picture, if it can be so characterized.
   During my early experience on this court, my family remained
in Hillsboro, and when in Chicago I stayed at a hotel. I made
the trip back and forth over the weekends, and my travel expense
exceeded the per diem I would have received had I remained in
Chicago, and besides, 1 soon discovered that Saturdays and Sun­
days were my two best working days. I also found it difficult
to obtain hotel accommodations in Chicago unless a room was
retained by the week; in fact, during the war period it was almost
impossible to obtain a room unless it was continuously reserved.
In 1939, 1 leased an apartment by the year and furnished it, in
which my wife and 1 have since lived while in Chicago. I vol­
untarily listed my furniture for assessment and pay taxes on it
(I think this is contrary to the custom in Chicago.) I own no
other property and pay no other tax in Chicago. I have member­
ship in no church, lodge, or organization in Chicago other than
some clubs and bar associations, of which I have been made an
honorary member.
   The following mayor may not be pertinent but 1 think it dis­
closes a rather definite intent and purpose on my part to maintain
                                 98 

Hillsboro as my place of residence. Many years ago my wife and
I made plans to build a home in Hillsboro smaller than the one
we have occupied since 1920. Erection of that home was com­
menced last summer and is now almost completed. We have can­
celed the lease on our Chicago apartment, effective June 1, and our
furniture will be moved to Hillsboro and placed in the new home.
As soon as that is done, we will have a public sale of the household
furnishings in the old home. That house is now in the hands of
a real estate agent for sale. (These plans were all formulated long
before the instant controversy concerning per diem.)
   I do not see how it can reasonably be thought that my actual
residence has ever been at any place other than Hillsboro, unless
it be possible that I have had 2 places of actual residence, 1 in
Hillsboro and the other in Chicago. If I have abandoned my
Hillsboro residence by reason of my activities in Chicago in con­
nection with this court, I did precisely the same thing during my
service in Congress, where I lived with my family on numerous
occasions in a leased apartment for periods as long as 7 or 8
months at a time.
   I have given much thought to means that might be adopted
in this circuit to decrease the maintenance expenses of judges, and
it is a perplexing problem. Of course, they can be reduced by
judges spending less of their time here, which calls for some kind
of a limitation. It would be easier to express my views if I were
not involved, in other words, if they only related to other members
of the court, as well as its future members. I recognize that the
members of this Court who reside at places other than Chicago
can come here, hear the cases and go home to write their opinions.
To do so, in my judgment, will seriously impair the character of
service which the court is expected to and should render the bar
and litigants. If the committee should be interested in this phase
of the matter, I would suggest that it obtain the views of some of
the leading members of the bar, particularly those of Chicago.
   A requirement that members of this court establish Chicago
as their official residence would, in my opinion, constitute a serious
blow to the court, presently and even more so in the future. I
need not tell your committee that Walter Lindley is a splendid
judge who, in my view, can do more and better work than any
judge I have known. He no doubt would take advantage of his
right to retire if Chicago was designated as his official residence,
which would require him to pay his own expenses while attending
                                 99 

court in Chicago. Such a prOVlswn would probably eliminate
the desire or willingness of any district judge of the circuit (other
than Chicago) to become a member of this court. I am sure that
neither Lindley nor Duffy, both former district judges, would have
accepted an appointment to this court under such circumstances.
At any rate, they would have been better off financially to continue
on the district bench. And so it will be with other district judges
who might be considered for appointment in the future.
   I am sorry to have written in so much detail and in such rambling
fashion. I have great confidence in your committee and I feel safe
in stating in advance that you will find me willing to subscribe to
any recommendation which it makes.
   I expect to attend the meeting of your committee at the Drake
Hotel on April 23, in order to be available for any assistance which
I may be able to render. In the meantime, if there is any further
information that you desire, please advise me.
        Sincerely,
                                                      J. E. MAJOR.

Hon. ORIE L. PHILLIPS,

   DEAR JUDGE PHILLIPS: As per our telephone conversation and
supplementary to my letter to you of April 13, 1953, I give you
the following information regarding my living status both in
Hillsboro and in Chicago:
   My home in Hillsboro is a 2-story house, with 4 rooms on the
first floor and 4 bedrooms on the second floor, including an enclosed
sleeping porch. All the rooms are complet<lly furnished, most
of which furniture is more than 20 years old. This house was
purchased in 1920. During the time I have been away, occasioned
by my service in Congress and as a member of the court, the house
has never been leased or rented, and at all times I have paid utility
bills, such as telephone, water, gas, light, and heat. In other words,
the house was always ready for occupancy when we were there.
   My apartment in Chicago is ll-A at 180 East Delaware Street.
It has a living room, small dining room, kitchen and two bedrooms.
                                100 

I leased this apartment in 1939, and purchased the furniture which
it contains (the kitchen utilities are furnished by the management).
I have leased this apartment on an annual basis. The rent in the
beginning was $145 per month but has been increased until I am
now paying $235 per month, and I am advised it shortly will be
increased to $275. As I told you before, the main reason for
leasing this apartment was that in 1939 and for several subsequent
years it was difficult and almost impossible to obtain any kind of
apartment, furnished or otherwise, except on an annual basis. It
was equally difficult to obtain a room in a hotel without reserving
it by the week or month. My wife is here with me most of the
time. This apartment is larger than we need but, after much
searching, it was the only one we could find at the time it was
first leased.
   As I told you before, we have planned for several years to build
us a new home in Hillsboro, all on the ground floor, and this we
have done. I have given notice that the apartment lease will be
canceled June 1, and have already made arrangements to move
the furniture in the apartment to the new home in Hillsboro. The
old home there is for sale and most of the furniture which it
contains will be sold in the near future. I expect to be able from
now on to do what I would always have liked to have done, that is,
spend more of my time in Hillsboro. The more time I can spend
 there, the better it will suit me.
         Sincerely,
                                                    J. E.   MAJOR.

Home address: Indianapolis, Ind.

The Honorable 0RIE L. PHILLIPS,
     United States Circ:uit Judge,
          Post Office Box 2210, Denver 1, Colo.
   My DEAR JUDGE PHILLIPS: I am happy to answer your letter
of April 8, concerning my actual residence.
   My home has continuously been in Indianapolis since early in
1919 when I returned there after World War 1. When I was ap­
pointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit I had no thought of giving up or abandoning our home in
Indianapolis. When I closed my law office to come on this court
I retained part of my law books thinking that I would try to secure
an office in the Federal Building in Indianapolis so that I could
do some of my work there. I called on Mr. George Ress, the post­
master at Indianapolis, and talked to him about the possibility of
my securing an office in the Federal Building.
   After I started work on this court I tried to do some work in
Indianapolis at my home but I found that, while working there,
I was subjected to many interruptions-my wife and I had both
been engaged in too many civic activities and had too many friends
to suddenly quit everything while we were down there. However,
I think that if I now had an office in the Federal Building in In­
dianapolis, after having been up here for more than 3 years, I could
work there with few interruptions. But at that time I did not
pursue the matter further and I have never had an office fur­
nished me in the Federal Building there.
   We still own and maintain our home at 3166 North Delaware
Street in Indianapolis just the same as before I came on this court.
It is a rather large home with automatic gas heat. We have a
colored maid there all of the time and she has worked for us for
                                (101)
                              102 


more than 15 years. She takes care of our home and has it ready
for us at all times. The only other person who considers that
home as his home is our unmarried son who is now, and has been
for about 3 years, working for the J. Lewis Small Manufacturing
Co. at Elwood, Ind. He does a great deal of traveling for the
company but spends many of the weekends at home.
   At the time I came on this court I was a member of many or­
ganizations in Indianapolis, including the North Methodist
Church, Indianapolis Athletic Club, Masonic Lodge, Indianapolis
Bar Association, Lawyers' Club, Indiana Bar Association, Ameri­
can Legion, Forty and Eight, YMCA, Indianapolis Service Club
and many others. I have retained my membership in these or­
ganizations in Indianapolis and have joined no such organizations
in Chicago. I have been sent honorary membership cards for a
few organizations in Chicago but have been active in none here.
   All my contributions to charities, such as the Community Fund,
Red Cross, Infantile Paralysis, and Crippled Children, have been
made in Indianapolis.
   Since I have been on this court I have paid quarterly Indiana
gross income and bonus tax as a resident of Indianapolis, Ind.
   When I am in Chicago Mrs. Swaim is usually with me and most
of the time we have been here we have lived in a small furnished
apartment which we rent by the month. The only things we own
in that apartment are our personal belongings, a television set
and an orthopedic mattress on which I have to sleep. If the bills
!lOW pending in Congress are passed we, of course, shall have to
change our pattern of living.
   Before coming on this court I had been for many years well ac­
quainted with two of the judges and knew how the members of
this court had been interpreting the provisions regarding main­
tenance and travel expenses. While I appreciate the honor of
being a member of this court I seriously doubt if I would have
accepted the appointment if I had thought that coming on this
court meant giving up our home in Indianapolis, where Mrs. Swaim
and I have lived practically all of our lives.
   I should be very happy to meet with your committee at the
Drake Hotel in Chicago on April23d to further discuss this matter
with you.
        Yours sincerely,
                                           H.   NATHAN SWAIM.

      UNITED CoURT OF ApPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH          CIRCUIT

                        1212 LAKE SHORE DRIVE, CHICAGO, 10,
                                                      April 24, 1953.
 Chambers of Judge H. Nathan Swaim
 Home address: Indianapolis, Ind.
 The Honorable ORIE L. PHILLIPS,
       Drake Hotel, Chicago, Ill.
    My DEAR JUDGE PHILLIPS: Judge Major has informed me that
 you would like to have additional information on my home in
 Indianapolis.
    My home there is located at 3166 North Delaware Street. It
 is a large two-story house which I bought in 1932. It has three
 bedrooms, a den and a sleeping porch on the second floor and on
 the first floor there is a large entrance hall, a living room, dining
 room, breakfast nook, and kitchen. There is also a maid's room
 in the basement. The taxes on this home--on real and personal
 property-are a little more than $500 per year. As I indicated in
 my former letter to you, we keep this home open and all utilities
 turned on all the time and we have a maid there taking care of it
 so that it is ready for occupancy at any time that we are able to
 get down there. We, of course, pay all of the taxes and utility
 bills and the maid's salary.
    As I pointed out to you in my former letter, I have continued
 since being on this court to pay the Indiana gross income tax as a
 resident of Indianapolis, Ind. This tax applies only to residents
 and to persons doing business in Indiana. This gross income tax
 on my salary amounts to approximately $200 per year.
    As to the apartment I have been occupying while I am here in
 Chicago, it is located at 40 East Oak Street, an apartment hotel.
 The apartment is fully furnished by the hotel which also furnishes
  .     , maid service, bell boy service, and the other ordinary serv­
.ices provided by a hotel of that type. The apartment which I am
 occupying there now consists of a living room, bed room, dinette,
 and small kitchen. The rental is $275 a month and I rent the
 apartment on a month-to-month basis.
    As to my home in Indianapolis, I am attaching a small snapshot
 picture of the same which I happen to have here.
         Yours sincerely,
                                                H. NATHAN SWAIM.
