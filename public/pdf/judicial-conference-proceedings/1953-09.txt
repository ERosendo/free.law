    REPORT OF THE P,ROCEEDINGS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING
    OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES

       The Judicial Conference of the United States convened pursuant
    to Title 28, United States Code, Section 331, on September 24,1953,
    and continued in session two days. Because of the vacancy in the

                                                 Chief Judge William Denman. 

                                                 Chief judge Orie L. Phillips.

      The Conference adopted the following resolution:
            In the death of Chief Justice Vinson the country has sus­
         tained the loss of one who filled wen and worthily the highest
         judicial·office in the land, and we as members of this Confer­
         ence have suffered the great personal loss of one whom we
         loved and respected as a man and whose service as presiding.
         officer of the Conference had made it an instrumentality of
         great and ever-increasing importance in the administration of
         justice. Chief Justice Vinson came to the office of Chief Jus­
         tice at a critical period in the history of our country, a period
         fraught with many dangers and difficulties. He brought to
         the performance of his duties a wide knowledge of men and
         affairs as well as of the law, wisdom ripened by experience and
         a profound and intimate knowledge of the nature and workings
         of our government having theretofore served with distinction
       . in the legislative, executive and judicial branches. This ex­
         perience gave him an unusual grasp of governmental problems
         and a sureness in .approaching and dealing with them rarely
         equalled in our history. His knowledge of the legislative
        .branch and his personal acquaintance with the leaders of that
         branch enabled him to develop. between. this Q:mference and
                                             (1)

     the Congress a relationship which has resulted in a better .~
     understanding of problems affecting the judiciary and the """,""
     passage of legislation which has done much to improve the
     courts and the administration of justice therein.
        Arnan of learning and industry, of wisdom and understand­
     ing,· of unimpeachable integrity and wide human sympathy,
     he has served his country well and will be long remembered in
     gratitude by his fellow countrymen. He measured up to the
     highest standard of manhood. In the language of the ancient
     prophet he did justly, he loved mercy and he walked humbly
     before God. May his kindly spirit rest in peace and may the
     example which he has left us of consecrated public service and
     devotion to the common good be an inspiration to all of us in
     the years that lie ahead.
   The Conference also adopted the following resolution:
        In the retirement of Judge Thomas W. Swan and Judge
     Augustus Hand, the federal judiciary loses the active service
     of two of the outstanding circuit judges of the country who
     have been of great service in the work of the Conference. The
     Conference takes note of their long and distinguished records
     on the federal hench, congratulates them upon their achieve­
     ments and expresses the :Q()pe that they may be with us for
     many years to come, that they may continue to render service
     in their judicial capacities and that we may continue to have 0

     the benefit of their advice and assistance in solving the prob­
     lems which arise in the administration of justice.

panied by The Deputy Attorney General, Honorable William P.

                    REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

      The Attorney General, Honorable Herbert Brownell, Jr., pre­
    sented his report to the Conference. The full report appears in
    the appendix.
    REPORT OF THE DIREUl'OR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE
                          UNITED STATES COURTS

       Pursuant to the statute (28 U. S. C. 604 (a) (3» the Director
    had previously submitted his fourteenth annual report on the activ­
    ities of his office for the fIscal year ended June 30, 1953, including
    a report of the Chief of the Division of Procedural Studies and
    Statistics on the state of the business of the courts. The Confer­
    en~e approved the immediate release of the report for publication
    and authorized the Director to revise 'and supplement it in the
    final printed edition to be issued later.

                         BUSINESS OF THE COURTS

      State of the docketsoi'the Federal courts-Courts of appeals.­
o   Cases commenced in the United States Courts of Appeals increased
    by 5 percent in the fiscal year 1953 as compared with 1952. The
    number of cases begun was 3,226 and the number terminated,
    3,043, leaving 1,845 pending at the end of the fiscal year. During
    the last 6 years, the general tre.nd of the cases filed in the appellate
    courts has been upward but at a gradual rate. The increase since
    1948 has been 17 percent. .But increases in the District of Co­
    lumbia, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Ninth Circuits have been larger.
    In the Ninth the increase has been from 284 in 1948 to 450 in
    1953 or 58 percent.
       The number of cases commenced in 1953 with relation to the
    number of judges in the court was much larger in the Fifth Circuit
    than in any other, with the next heaviest load in the Ninth Circuit.
    In the Fifth Circuit the number of cases filed exceeded the number
    of cases terminated by 20, while in the Ninth Circuit the difference
    was 98. The pending load in the Fifth Circuit increased to 264
    and in the Ninth Circuit to 430. The only other Circuit with more
    than 200 ()ases pending on June 30 was tQe District of Columbia
    with 292.
       The median interv/tl from filing to disposition for cases heard
    and submitted in all circuits was 7.0 months compared with 7.3
         275129-53-2
                               4


months in 1952. The circuits with the longest median interval ~
were the Ninth with an interval of 12.6 months, the District of ~
Columbia with a 9.9 months interval and the Fifth Circuit with a
median of 9.6 months. While the dockets of most of the courts of
appeals are in satisfactory condition, the existence of 7 vacancies
in these courts is making the expeditious disposition of cases more
difficult.
   Petitions to the Supreme Court for review on certiorari to the
United States Courts of Appeals were 603 compared with 5921{,tst
year. Of the number acted on, 89 or 14.3 percent were granted
compared with 90 or 14.8 percent in 1952.
   District courts.-An increase of 9.5 percent in the number of
civil cases commenced in the district courts over the 1952 ngure
brought the number of new cases filed to 64,001. This followed a
13 percent increase in the previous year. Again, as last year, the
cases terminated, which numbered 57,490, were about 10 percent
less than the number filed. The result has been an increase in the
number of civil cases pending to 66,873 on June 30, 1953. This is
the largest number of pending cases in many years and it em­
phasizes the congested state of the civil dockets in many districts,
particularly those in metropolitan centers.                .
   Since 1941 the number of civil cases filed annually has increased
by 66 percent while the number of judgeships is now only 14 per­
cent greater than it was at the end of the last prewar year. Pri­
vate cases which on the average take much more judicial time than
Government cases have increased even more. The number of
private cases filed annually has risen by 83 percent and the number
pending by 130 percent, since 1941.
   In more than a quarter of the districts having solely federal
jurisdiction, the median interval from filing to disposition for civil
cases terminated after trial during the fiscal year 1953 exceeded the
national median of 12.4 months. Special mention should be made
of the situation in the Southern District of New York, the Eastern
and \Vestern Districts of Pennsylvania and the Northern District
of Ohio where delay in reaching trial has attained very serious
proportions. Detailed information concerning these and other
districts is given in the Director's report.
   The number of criminal cases filed in the district courts is above
that of the years immediately preceding World War II because of ......
the large number of immigration cases commenced in districts
                                                                  -
                                       5

     bordering Mexico. Excluding them, other. criminal cases dropped
     sharply from 1944 to 1948 and the number has Buctuated within
     a small range since that time. In 1953 the numbel," of criminal
     cases filed was 37,291, a decrease of about 700 from the previous
     year, but criminal cases other than immigration increased from
     24,803 to 25,702 or 3.6 percent. While the number of cases ter­
     minated was somewhat less than the number commenced, the
     pending case load is small and consists, in part, of cases which
     cannot be prosecuted because of fugitive defendants who have not
     been apprehended. Speaking generally, criminal cases are given
     precedence, and the criminal dockets are in good condition.
       A sharp rise in bankruptcy cases is taking place which was evi­
     denced by a 15 percent increase in filings during the fiscal year
     1953 and a rise of 24 percent in the fourth quarter followed by an
     even larger increase in the first 2 months of the current fiscal year.
     The upward trend in evidence from 1946 to 1950 appears to have
     been resumed. Bankruptcy cases filed in 1953 were 40,087 and
     the number terminated was 37,485 leaving 38,786 pending on
     June 30, 1953.

o
      Cases and motions under adwement.-At the end of the fiscal
     year, 102 cases and motions were reported by district judge~ as
     having been held under advisement more than 60 days. Of these,
     23 which had been taken under advisement more than 6 months
     before June 30, had been called to the attention of· the circuit
     councils in accordance with a standing direction of the Judicial
     Conference. A report by the Administrative Office to the Con­
     ference indicated that all but 10 of these cases submitted before
     January 1,1953 either had been or would be disposed of before the
     beginning of October.
                      ADDITIONAL JUDGESIDPS NEEDED

        It is the sense of the Conference that additional judges are des­
     perately needed in many of the federal courts of the country, both
     circuit and district, and the Conference respectfully urges expedi­
     tious action by Congress to provide for the appointment of addi­
     tional judges,·
        A bill (S. 15) passed by the Senate at the last session of Con­
     gress provided for· 4 circuit judgeships and 35 district judgeships,
     some of which were temporary as the result of a provision that the
                                       6

first succeeding vacancy should not be filled. The -Hdl1se of Rep.-:
resEmtativesreduced the number to 3 circuit judgeships and 23
 district judgeships, and passed the bill as so amended, but the
conferees ofthe two houses failed to agree. The bill is pending for
 further action by the second -session of the S3d Congress.

             SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS

    The Director reported that in his judgment the salaries of
national park commissioners ought to be re-examined. Under
the statute (28 U. S. C. 634) the salaries of these commissioners
are ~ed by the district courts of the districts in which the parks
are situated, with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the
United States. The present salaries of the commissioners were
approved by the Conference at a special meeting in November of
1949. The matter was referred to the Committee on Supporting
Personnel for study and recommendation .
  . The Director called the attention of the Conference to the pro­
visions. of Public Law 102 of the 83d Congress, approved July 2,
1953, which limits the amount of annual leave which can be aC­
cumulated hereafter by Government employees, including em­
ployees of the courts, to 30 days. Another provision of the act
requires the heads of agencies to take such action as may be neces­
sary to reduce to 30 days the accumulated annual leave to the
credit, of personnel of their agencies in excess of that amount
"within a reasonable period of years, consistent with the exigencies
p.f . the public business." The Director recommended that for
the supporting personnel of the courts who are subject to the leave
laws and regulations a period of 10 years be allowed for the re­
duetionofaccumulated annual leave to a maximum of 30 days
witl:lOllt prescribing that any specified part of the excess ,above 30
days be consumed, annually. The Director stated that in his
opinion this length of time with a maximum degree of flexibility
                                                                          -
                                      9

     is necessary in order to be fair to the court employees and to bring
      about a reduction of excess leave in compliance with the statute
     without materially impairing the service to the courts. He stated
      that he would suggest without requiring that the use of the surplus
     leave be distributed as evenly as feasible over the period. The
     Conference approved the recommendation of the Director.
        Judge Laws submitted a written request for additional pro­
     visions for supporting personnel for the District Court for the
      District of Columbia and asked that it be referred to the Com­
      mittee on Supporting Personnel for consideration. The request
     .was referred to the Committee for study and report.
                       BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

        Judge Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy Ad­
     ministration, reported that the committee had met and considered
     the recommendations contained in the report of the Bankruptcy
     Division of the Administrative Office, which was approved by the
     Director on August 21, 1953, relating to certain changes in the
     salaries of referees, and other arrangements.

o	      Studies and surveys were conducted by the Bankruptcy Division
     covering the districts affected by the report. For those districts,
     the resurvey extended previous surveys through June 30, 1953, and
     took into account both for the district and for each referee's office
     affected, the number, size and character of pending cases; the
     number, size and character of cases referred to the referees since
     July 1, 1947; the payments by each district and by each referee
     into the Referees' Salary and Expense Funds and other. pertinent
     data. 	          .                                        .
        The report of August 21, 1953, was submitted by the Director
     to the members of the Judicial Conference and to the judicial coun­
     cils and the district judges of the circuits and districts concerned,
     with the request that the district judges advise the judicial councils
     of their respective circuits of their opinion in respect to the recom­
     mendations for their districts and that the chief judges of the cir­
     cuits in turn inform the Administrative Office of the views of the·
     judicial councils of their circuits. The Director's report together
     with the recommendations of the district judges and of the circuit
     councils were considered by the Committee on Bankruptcy Ad­
     ministration. The Conference had before it the committee's re­
--

single fuJl·tlme position at Portland to serve the (ll1tlro District of Maine. Bangor was eontinued as a place
of holding court for the full·tlme referee at Portland.

  The salary increases approved by the Judicial Conference for
positions that remain on a part-time basis were made effective
October 1, 1953. Changes from part-time to full;.time positions
were made effective as soon as practicable after appropriated funds
are available for the payment of the full-time salaries authorized.
The Director was instructed to seek, at the first opportunity, a
supplemental appropriation sufficient to cover the increased cost
of salaries~
  .'    DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED MONEYS IN BANKRUPTCY CASES

    Pursuant to the direction of the Judicial Conference at a special
 'session held in Washington on March 26-27, ·1953, the Director
 circulated among the circuit .and district judges, a ,report of the
 special committee recommending that Section 66b (11 U.8. C.
  106 (b» of the Bankruptcy Act dealing with the distribution of
                                           11 

    unclaimed moneys in bankrupt estates be repealed and that Section
    66a (11 U. S. C.I06 (a)) be amended by adding the following sen­
    tence at the end thereof so that the section as amended would read
    as follows:
       Dividends or other moneys which remain unclaimed for sixty days after the
    final dividend has been declared and distributed shall be paid by the trustee into
    the court of bankruptcy; and at the same time the trustee shall file with the
    clerk a list of the names and post-office addresses, as far as known, of the
    persons entitled thereto, showing the respective amounts payable to them. Suck
    moneys ana aividends shan be deposited and wUhdraum as provided in Title 28,
    U. S. G., Section 20-12. [ItaliCS indicate the amendment.]
      The judges were requested to express their views upon the report
    and the proposed amendments.
      The resolution of the Judicial Conference also directed that all
    views expressed be communicated to the Committee on Bank­
    ruptcy Administration for its consideration and that the Bank­
    ruptcy Committee make further· report to the Conference at its
    next regular session.
      The Committee after considering the replies received from the
    circuit and district judges, recommended that Section 66b of the
o   Bankruptcy Act be repealed and that Section 66a be amended by
    adding a sentence at the end thereof so that as amended it will
    read as follows:
       Dividends or other moneys which remain unclaimed for sixty days after the
    final dividend has been declared and distributed shall be paid by thl! trustee
    into the court of bankruptcy; and at the same time the trustee shall file with
    the clerk a list of the names and post-office addresses, as far as known, of the
    persons entitled thereto, showing the respective amounts payable to them. Such
    moneys and di'v'idend8shaLl be deposited and Withdrawn as provided in Title 28,
    U, S. G., Section 2042, and shall not be subject to escheat under the laws of any
    state. [Italics indicate the amcndment.]

      The recommendation of the Committee was approved by the
    Conference.

    CHANGES IN ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR THE REFEREES' SALARY AND
                                   EXPENSE FUNDS

       The Committee reported that pursuant to Section 40c (2) of the
    Bankruptcy Act the Director had recommended that the schedule
    of additional charges, for the Referees' Salary and Expense Funds,
    effective as to all cases filed on and after January 1, 1954, be revised
    as follows:
          275129-53-3

  One percent on net realization in straight bankruptcy cases.
  One-half of one percent on total obligations paid or extended in Chapter XI

  One-half of one percent upon payments made by or for the debtor in Chap­

  Upon the recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee the
Conference approved the schedules of additional fees and charges
as revised by the Director.
SPECIAL CHARGES FOR THE REFEREES' EXPENSE FUND FOR FILING
       PETITIONS FOR REVIEW AND RECLAMATION PETITIONS

   Pursuant to Section 40c (3) of the Bankruptcy Act, the Judicial
Conference at a special meeting held in Washington in April 1947,
promulgated a schedule of charges for special services rendered by
the referees, effective July 1, 1947. Item 3 of the schedule is as
follows:
  For filing petitions for review and for flllng petitions for reclamation of prop­
erty, $10 for each petition tiled, to be paid at the time of tiling by the petitioner.
  In order to conform this regulation to Section 2412 (a) of Title
28 of the United States Code which makes the United States liable
for fees and costs only when such liability is expressly provided
for by Act of Congress, the Director recommended that item 3 be
revised to read as follows:
  For filing petitions for review and for filing petitions for reclamation of
property, $10 for each petition tiled, to be paid at the time of filing by the peti­
tioner, procided that no charge 8halZ be made for petitions for rwietl." or for
reclamation 01 property filed on behaZI of the United States. [New language is
in italics.]
  The Committee recommended and the Conference approved
this revision of item 3 of the schedule of special charges for the                       If/i...
referees' expense fund.                                                                    "tl

                              RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES

       The Bankruptcy Committee brought to the attention of the Con­
    ference that several proposals for an increase in the compensation
    that may be allowed to receivers and trustees have been made in
    recent months, some of which have taken the form of legislation
    now pending in Congress, and that in certain districts the problem
    of obtaining experienced trustees to accept appointment is becom­
    ing increasingly difficult.
       The Committee adopted the following resolution which was ap­
    proved by the Conference:
      ItEsOLVED: That the Bankruptcy Committee be authorized to study the subject
    of receivers and trustees and their compensation including S. 2344, S. 2560, S. 2561,
    S. 2562, S. 2563 and H. R. 4400-SSd Congress, and report to the Conference.

              SAVINGS IN THE COST OF POSTAGE ON PENALTY MAIL

       Under Public Law 286, 83d Congress, effective August 15, 1953,
    the cost of postage on penalty mail in bankruptcy cases at first
    class rates of 3 cents per cover will amount to approximately $112,­

o   500 per year upon a volume of 50,000 cases. The Administrative
    Office estimates that 60 percent of these notices could be mailed as
    3d class material at 2 cents per cover which would reduce the cost
    to approximately $90,000 a year.
       Inasmuch as the same franked envelopes will be used as at pres­
    ent, which would be sealed, and therefore would move almost as
    rapidly as first class mail, the Committee recommended that the
    Administrative Office urge the referees in bankruptcy to use 3d
    class mail so far as possible in sending notices to creditors. The
    Conference approved this recommendation.
       The Committee also recommended in the interest of economy
    that the notice of the time fixed for filing objections to the discharge
    of the bankrupt and the notice of the first meeting of creditors be
    combined wherever possible. The Administrative Office estimates
    that an additional $25,000 or $30,000 a year could be saved in the
    cost of postage and that an even greater indirect saving could be
    accomplished in the expenditures for clerical help, supplies and
    equipment. This would require an amendment to Section 14b of
    the Bankruptcy Act which now provides that the order fixing the
    time for filing objections to the bankrupt's discharge shall not be
    entered until after the bankrupt shall have been examined.

Section 14b be amended to read as follows:
  Sec. 14b. After the filing fees required to be paid by this Act have been paid in
fuU the court shall make an order fixing a time for the filing of objections to the
bankrupt's discharge which shall be not less than 30 days after the first date 8f't
for the first meeting Of creditors. Notice of such order shall be given to all
parties in lnterest as provided in Sec. 58b of this Act. If the examination of the
bankrupt concerning his acts, cond1tct and property has not Or will not be cotn­
pleted within the time fixed for the filing of objections to the discharge the court
may, upon its Men motion or upon motion of the receiver, trustee, a creditor tlr
any other party in interest or for other cause shown, extend the time for filing
such objections.   [Italic language is new.]

 The new language at the beginning of the section as amended
would conform with General Order 35 (4) c which now provides:
  No proceedings upon the discharge of a bankrupt or debtor shall be instituted
until the filing fees are paid in full.
  Another conforming change would be needed in Section 58b (2).
That clause now requires the discharge notice to be mailed to the
trustee but, in cases in which the notices would be combined, the
trustee would not have been appointed when the notice is mailed.
The first sentence of Section 58b as amendea would read:
   b. The court shall give at least thirty days' notice by mail of the last day 

fixed by its order for the filing of objections to a bankrupt's discharge (1) to 

the creditors, in the manner prescribed in subdivision a of this section; (2) to 

the trustee it an1! and his attorney if any, at their respective addresses as filed 

by them with the court. [The italic words constitute the amendment.] 

  The Committee recommended and the Conference approved
these amendments to Section 14b and Section 58b (2) of the
Bankruptcy Act.
  In order that the trustee would be notified immediately upon his
appointment of the last day fixed for the filing of objections to the
discharge, the Committee suggested, if the Bankruptcy Act is
amended as above recommended, that the Supreme Court be re­
quested to amend General Order 16 so as to read as follows:
   It shall be the duty of the referee, immediately upon the appointment and
 approval of the trustee, to notify him in person or by mail of his appointment
 mtd of the time fixed for th,(J filing of objections to the bankrupt's di8Cha1'ge it
 8uch time has been fixed; and the notice shall require the trustee forthv,1th to
 notify the referee of his acceptance or rejection of the trust, and shall contain
 a statement of the penal sum of the trustees' bond. [The italic words con­
 stitute the amendment.]
    The Conference approved this suggestion.

                                           THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM

                  Pursuant to the direction of the Conference at its meeting in
               March 1952/ the Director reported concerning requests for changes
               in compensation and arrangements for court reporters.
                  The judicial conferences of five circuits had adopted resolutions
               in favor of general increases in the salary scale of the reporters: the
               District of Columbia Cjrcuit, and the Third, Seventh, Ninth and
               Tenth Circuits. The resolutions of the judicial conferences of the
               Third, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits had also recommended increases
               in the transcript rates approved by the Conference, the resolution
               of the Third Circuit attaching some conditions.

                                           GENERAL INCREASES IN SALARIES

                 The Director submitted to the Conference a written report in
               which he discussed in detail the proposals of the resolutions and
               stated his recommendations. The Conference approved the re­
               port and in accordance therewith provided for general increases in
               the salaries of the reporters, as shown by the following table, to
               take effect upon July 1, 1954 contingent upon the necessary

                                            CHANGES IN SPECIFIC SALARIES

                 The Director also reported to the Conference that the judges of
               the district courts for the eastern district of Tennessee and the
               southern district of Indiana urged that the salaries of the reporters
               for those districts were inequitable in relation to the salaries of the
               reporters for the other districts in the respective states. The Di­
               rector concurred in their views and recommended that on the basis

of the present salary scale, the salaries of the reporters for the east­
ern district of Tennessee be increased from $4,000 to $4,500 per
annum, and that the salary of the reporter for the southern district
of Indiana be increased from $4,500 to $5,000 per annum, both
increases to be effective at once. The Director further recom­
mended in accordance with a request of the judge of the district
court for the eastern district of Illinois at Danville, that the court
be authorized to employ at that location in place of a reporter­
secretary as at present, a reporter only at a present salary of $3,600
per annum, the authority for the arrangement to be effective im­
mediately. The Conference approved the salary recommenda­
tions of the Director for the three districts effective at once, with
the understanding that whenever the general increase in the sal­
ary scale approved by the Conference at this meeting as shown
above takes effect, the salaries shall be subject to a further increase
in accordance with the increase in the general salary scale.
   The Conference in accordance with the recommendation of the
Director authorized an increase in the estimate for salaries of sup­
porting personnel of the judiciary for 1955 by $115,000, to defray
the cost of the general and specific increases in salary above
authorized.

           INCREASES IN TRANSCRIPT RATES DISAPPROVED

  The Director in his report recommended against any increase in
the transcript rates which the Conference had previously author­
ized the several district courts to prescribe. The Conference ap­
proved the Director's recommendation, and declined to approve
any increase in transcript rates.
   Upon the recommendation of the committee on transcript rates
of the Judicial Conference of the Third Circuit, which was pre­
sented by Circuit Judge Maris of that circuit, the Conference ap­
proved a provision in reference to the procedure for determining
the charges for daily or other expedited transcript, that such
charges shall be fixed by agreement of the parties which in each
individual case shall be submitted to the trial judge and shall re­
quire his express approval, and that in lengthy cases the reporter's
charges shall be fixed after the conclusion of the case, with progress
payments to the reporter or deposits as ordered by the court.

                               ApPROPRIATIONS

      The Director submitted to the Conference estimates for supple­
    mental appropriations for the fiscal year 1954 and for annual ap­
    propriations for the fiscal year 1955 which, under the statute (28
    U. S. C. 605), require the approval of the Conference.
      He informed the Conference that supplemental appropriations
    for the current fiscal year will be needed for fees of jurors, for travel
    expenses due to the enactment of Public Law 222 of the 83d Con­
    gress increasing the maximum subsistence allowance of judges to
    $15 per day, for payment of penalty mail pursuant to Public Law
    286 of the 83d Congress, and for increases authorized by the Con­
    ference in the salaries of referees in bankruptcy. The estimates
    for supplemental appropriations were approved by the Conference.
       The Director explained the estimates for annual appropriations
    for the fiscal year 1955 and informed the Conference that the esti­
    mates would have to be increased by the cost of penalty mail pur­
    suant to Public Law 286 and increases in the salaries of referees in
    bankruptcy and court reporters authorized by the Conference.
    The Conference approved the estimates with authorization to the
o   Director to include these additional items.
                      OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM

      The report of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury Sys­
    tem was presented to the Conference by Judge Watkins, the Chair­
    man of the Committee.
                        JURY ALLOWANCES IN ALASKA

       The Committee reported that in accordance with the instruc­
    tions of the Conference CRept. Sept. 1952, p. 18) it had studied the
    resolution of the 1952 session of the Judicial Conference of the
    Ninth Circuit which had recommended increases in the allow­
    ances for attendance and subsistence of jurors in Alaska, and had
    consulted the Alaska judges about the matter. As a result of this
    study, the Committee concurred in the resolution of the Ninth
    Circuit. I t recommended that the fee for attendance for jurors
    in Alaska be increased from $7 to $10 per day; that the subsistence
    allowance be increased from $5 to $7 per day; and that the allow­
    ance for travel be fixed at 15 cents per mile in all divisions or actual
                                 18 


travel expenses in lieu of mileage. The Committee recommended
that these rates be prescribed by the Director under U. S. C. Title
48 section 25 and Title 28 section 604, and that they be made ef­
fective as soon as practicable.
   The Conference approved these proposals of the Committee.

         THE COST OF DAILY OR INTERIM TRAVEL OF JURORS

  The Committee reported that it had considered the question,
referred to it by the Conference at its March 1953 Session, of the
desirability of amending section 1871 of Title 28, United States
Code, relating to allowances for jurors, with particular reference
to the provision for the payment of travel expense at the rate of
7 cents a mile when jurors return to their homes each night during
their term of service.
  The majority of the Committee were of the view that under
the present statute the payment of travel allowances for interim
overnight trips by jurors between their homes and the places where
they are serving the court can be so excessive as to amount to an
abuse. They recommend that the statute be amended so as to
make it impossible for jurors to be paid large amounts daily for         ....
mileage alone, but to allow them full mileage when the Court ex-         ~.
cuses them for several days or weeks. The amendment proposed
by the Committee would eliminate from the statute the authority
which it now contains to pay jurors at the flat rate of 7 cents per
mile "for all additional necessary daily travel expense," and sub­
stitute for it a provision to permit such payment only when it will
not exceed the subsistence allowance which would have been paid
the juror if he had remained at the place of holding court over­
night or during temporary recess.
   The Committee reported that suggestion had been made to it
that under present law excessive jury transportation costs could
be controlled by the district courts through the exercise of their
powers under U. S. C. Title 28, section 1871 to limit daily travel to
that which is "necessary" and to require the payment of only
"subsistence of $5 per day" when, in the Court's opinion, daily
travel appears impracticable and under U. S. C. Title 28, section
1865, to select jurors from only those parts of the district which are
close enough to the place where the term of the Court is to be held
that "unnecessary expense" and "burden" upon the citizens of any         A
part of the district may be avoided. They pointed out that this is       "".
                                      19 

     successfully done now in many districts, and the possibility that
     if the Conference should call these powers to the attention of the
     judges in districts where there appears to be unnecessary and im­
     practicable daily jury travel, and the Administrative Office would
     inform the courts concerned of the situation in their districts, the
     travel payments to jurors in all courts might be thus reduced to a
     uniform basis without statutory amendment. The majority of
     the Committee stated that they would not be adverse to such a
     course if the Conference should consider it preferable to the en­
     actment of the flat legislative prohibition stated in the proposed
     statutory amendment.
        The Conference received the report of the Committee on this
     point, and directed that the report and the proposed statute be
     circulated throughout the Judiciary for an expression of the views
     of the judges to be followed by further report by the Committee.

                     APPEARANCES BEFORE GRAND JURIES

        The Committee reported that the late Chief Justice had requested
     its views concerning the bill, S. 1801, 83rd Congress, "to authorize
     requests for appearances before grand juries in certain instances."
     which would make punishable by fine and jail sentence the failure
     of the foreman of a grand jury or the prosecutor to bring to the
     attention of the grand jury a written request by one under investi­
     gation for permission to appear before the jury. The Committee
     was of the opinion that as a matter of policy the bill is unnecessary
     and inadvisable and that in any event, the bill should be amended
     to provide as a condition for conviction that the failure to present
     the request to the grand jury must have been willful and deliberate
     and not a mere matter of inadvertent neglect. The Committee
     recommended that the Conference disapprove the bill.
        The Conference agreed with the recommendation of the Commit­
     tee and expressed its disapproval of S. 1801.            ..         .

                                 JUBYOOSTS

       'fhe Committee expressed approval of continuation of the jury
     cost studies of the AdminIstrative Office arid urged the creation in
     each circuit of circuit committees or the establishment of other
     procedures to study the Admiriistrative Office statistics concerning
~    costs in thedistriets of the circuit and develop needed measures for
__   economy in the selection and service of jurors.

                                 20 


   The Conference approved the recommendation.                           ~'
   The report of the Administrative Office on the costs of the opera­    1tttJ!L.
tion of the jury system was presented to the members of the Con­
ference and its circulation among the members of the Federal
Judiciary was authorized.
         JURY ADMINISTRATION IN METROPOLITAN COURTS

   The Committee reported that there had been referred to it a
complaint by a juror of wasted time and money in his term of serv­
ice as a juror in one of the district courts in a large city. The Com­
mittee had studied the complaint and concluded that while the
particular situation of the juror concerned did not of itself indi­
cate any extraordinary condition, yet it served to point out again
the difficulties of jury administration in the trial courts in the
great metropolitan centers. The Committee urged that in those
courts in particular, the jury procedures require study. It pointed
out that for such courts the Committee and the Conference have
recommended the establishment of jury pools, so operated that only
the number of jurors actually required for trials to be conducted
at anyone time will be in attendance at that time. The Committee         "
suggested that the circuit jury committees in circuits where there       "­
are large metropolitan areas should be appointed as soon as possible,
and might include in their membership not only judges but law­
yers, laymen and jury commissioners as well, and that these com­
mittees with the aid of studies which the Administrative Office
might furnish should attempt to develop administrative practices
that will provide solutions to the peculiar problems of jury admin­
istration in multiple judge courts in metropolitan areas.
   In accordance with the suggestion of the Committee, the Judicial
Conference strongly recommended the establishment of such com­
mittees in the circuits concerned and intensive study by those com­
mittees of the metropolitan trial court jury systems in those areas.
                          JURORS' MANUAL

  The Committee reported that it is presently revising the Manual
for Jurors approved by the Conference in 1943; that it is seeking
the assistance of the judges throughout the country in this project;
and that it hopes to be able to report finally upon this aspect of its A..
work at the next regular ~ession of the. Conference.               .-~
                                21
          RENEWAL OF LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

   On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference renewed
its recommendation for the enactment of the bill developed by
the Committee to establish uniform qualifications of jurors (S. 961,
83d Congress) and, with certain minor amendments explained and
recommended by the Committee, of the bill to provide for jury
commissioners in the district courts (S. 959, 83d Congress). The
Conference authorized the Committee to continue to advocate the
enactment of both of these proposals.
   The Conference also renewed its disapproval of certain bills re­
lating to the powers of grand jurors, introduced in the present Con­
gress as H. R. 448 and H. R. 478 (See Rept. Jud. Conf., Sept. 1952,
pp.I6-17).
    PROCEDURE IN ANTITRUST AND OTHER PROTRACTED CASES

   Judge Prettyman, Chairman of the Committee on Procedure in
Antitrust and other Protracted Cases, reported to the Conference
that there has been an apparent growing acceptance by both the
courts and the bar of the general suggestions contained in the first
report of the Committee adopted by the Conference at its Septem­
ber 1951 session (Conf. Rept. pp. 22-24). He informed the Con~
ference that the American Bar Association has created a section on
antitrust law, and that section has created a committee on pro­
cedure to which the report has been referred for study. He stated
that the Judicial Conference Committee on Pretrial Procedure has
been giving special attention to pretrial procedure in protra.cted
cases.
   Judge Prettyman informed the Conference that following the
recommendations contained in the report on procedure before ad­
ministrative agencies adopted by the Conference at its September
1951 session (Conf. Rept. pp. 25-26) a conference of representa­
tives of administrative agencies had been called by the President
and had held its first session June 10-11, 1953. The conference
is composed of delegates from 56 Government departments, bu­
reaus and agencies, 12 members of the practicing bar, and 3 Fed­
eral judges. Judge Pret,tyman is acting as chairman of the confer­
ence at the request ofthe President. Phases of the general prob­
lem have been assigned to 10 committees and the next session of
the conference is scheduled to be held November 23, 1953.
   The report was ordered received and the Committee continued.

                           RETIREMENT OF JUDGES

   Judge Duffy, chairman, submitted the report of the Committee
on Retirement of Judges.
   Under existing law (Title 28, U. S. C., Sec. 371), in the event a
circuit or distric~ judge fails to resign or retire upon becoming
eligible because of age and tenure of service, the President may,
upon making a finding that such judge is unable to discharge suf­
ficiently all the duties of his office by reason of permanent mental
or physical disability and that the appointment of an additional
judge is necessary for the efficient dispatch of business, appoint an
additional judge by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
   At the March, 1952, meeting of the Judicial Conference of the
United States (Conf. Rept. pp. 16-17), approval was given to a
recommendation from its Committee on Retirement and Tenure
of Federal Judges that the scope of said provision be broadened
so as to include all United States judges appointed to hold office
during good behavior, and judges eligible to retire on account of
permanent disability without regard to age or length of service; and
in addition the Conference approved the committee's recommenda­
tion that before the President could appoint an additional judge
when a disabled judge did not retire, a certificate of the judge's
inability to perform the duties of his office must first be signed by
a majority of the Judicial Council of the Circuit in the case of a
circuit or district judge, and by a designated judge in the case of
judges of special courts. A proposed bill to carry out such recom­
mendations was approved by the Judicial Conference at its Sep­
tember, 1952, meeting.
   In the new Congress the foregoing recommendations were in­
corporated in the pending bill for additional judgeships (S. 15) as
it was reported to the Senate on May 4, 1953, by the Committee on
the Judiciary. The language used in S. 15 was as follows:
   (b) Whenever any judge of the United States appointed to hold office during
good hehavior who is eligible to retire under this section does not do 00 and a
certificate of his disability signed by a majority of the memhers of the Judicial
Council of his circuit in the case of a circuit or district judge, or by the Chief
Jnstice of the United States in the case of the chief judge of the Court of Claims,
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals or Customs Court, or by the chief judge
of his conrt in the case of a judge of the Court of Claims, Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals or Customs Court, is presented to the President and the President
finds that such judge is unable to discharge efficiently aU the duties of his otil.ce
by reason of permanent mental or physical disability and that the appointment
                                         23 

 of an additional judge is necessary for the efficient dispatch of business, the Pres­
 ident may make such appointment by and with the advice and consent of the
 Senate. Whenever any such additional judge is appointed, the vacancy subse­
 quently caused by the death, resignation or retirement of the disabled judge shall
 not be filled. Any judge whose disability canses the apPOintment of an addi­
 tional judge shall, for purposes of precedence, service as chief judge, or tempo­
 rary performance of the duties of that office, be treated as junior in commission
 to the other judges of the circuit, district or court.
    Unfortunately, however, the entire provision relating to the
 appointment by the President of an additional judge when a dis­
 abled judge fails to retire was stricken from the bill by an amend­
 ment adopted on the floor of the Senate, and as a result the bill
 as passed by the Senate is so worded that the present law as stated
 in Title 28 U. S. C. 371 (c) will be in effect repealed. This part
 of S. 15 was not amended by the House of Representatives when
 it passed the bill with amendments. The Conference renewed its
 recommendation with respect to the appointment of an additional
 judge in the event a physically or mentally disabled judge does
 not retire and urges that Congress expedite the passage of appro­
 priate legislation to accomplish that end.

o	  The Committee recommended that the Conference disapprove
 the enactment of H. R. 1800 which would provide tenure during
 good behavior for district judges in Alaska. The recommendation
 was adopted by the Conference.
    The Committee was authorized to circulate among the judges
 for an expression of their opinion a suggestion that retired judges
 be designated as "senior judges" instead of "retired judges."

 THE QUESTION OF LEGISLATION TO AUTHORIZE COMPENSATION FOR
                               EXPERT WITNESSES

    Judge Magruder, Chairman of the Committee to consider
 whether statutory authority should be given to federal judges to
 compensate, at rates appropriate for expert witnesses, experts
 called by the court itself in civil litigation to testify with respect
 to economic, professional, or other technical matters, reported that
 the Committee had reached the conclusion and recommended that
 the Conference take no action with regard to this matter and that
 the Committee be discharged. The Committee observed that of
 course individual judges will be free to work out a procedure with
 the consent of the parties in the relatively infrequent instances
 in which they may feel the need of summoning expert witnesses in
                                 24 

civil litigation. The recommendation of the Committee was
approved.
                                                                         It
             SOUND RECORDING OF COURT PROCEEDINGS

  Judge Laws, Chairman of the Committee on Sound Recording
of Court Proceedings, submitted a progress report in which he
stated that a number of striking experiments in sound recording
of court proceedings have been conducted. The report was re­
ceived and the Committee authorized to continue its work.

                       PRETRIAL PROCEDURE

  Judge Murrah, Chairman of the Committee of the Conference
on Pretrial Procedure, presented and discussed the report of the
Committee. He emphasized its desire to make available full infor­
mation concerning pretrial to newly appointed judges and referred
the members of the Conference to a handbook on pretrial pro­
cedure printed by the Administrative Office containing a statement
of its essentials, some sample of pretrial notices and orders and a
short bibliography. This pamphlet will be furnished to each
newly appointed district judge and through the chief judge of the
circuit and the members of the circuit pretrial committee as well as
the members of the Judicial Conference committee, the new judges'
attention will be called to the advantages of pretrial procedure and
to the methods by which it can be most successfully employed.
  Judge Murrah referred to the recommendation of the Committee
for the appointment by the Chief Justice of a panel of district judges
to make a special study of the use of pretrial in antitrust and other
protracted cases and for the adoption of a policy by the Judicial
Conference that a judge of this panel should be available to any
judge to whom a long case is assigned for consultation or to sit
jointly with him in the pretrial conference or to assist him in such
manner and extent as the trial judge may deem advisable. He
requested that action on this recommendation contained in the
committee report be deferred until the Conference Committee on
Procedure in Antitrust and Other Protracted Cases has had the
opportunity to study it so that a recommendation in the form to
be approved by both committees can be submitted. Judge Mur­
rah's presentation was supplemented by Judge Laws, a member of
the Committee.
                                 25 

  The Conference directed that the report of the Committee be
received, that action on the Committee's recommendation with ref­
erence to pretrial in protracted cases be deferred as requested and
that copies of the report be circulated throughout the Federal
Judiciary.
   The Conference resolved that it is the sense of the Conference
that the Judicial Councils of the various circuits should assure that
pretrial procedure is used in all the districts of their respective
circuits.
                        JUDICIAL STATISTICS

   Mr. Shafroth, Chief of the Division of Procedural Studies and
Statistics of the Administrative Office, presented the report of the
Committee. He briefly outlined the work of the Committee during
the past year and reported that it planned to furnish to newly
appointed judges a short monograph now in the course of prepara­
tion on the statistical reports furnished to the Administrative Of­
fice, the use made of them and an explanation of the statistical
tables regularly published by the office. He stated the view of the
Committee, elaborated in its report, that where a proposal for added
judge power in a particular court is under consideration in the
Congress and the available information concerning the judicial
business of that court indicates the absence of need for an increase
in the judge power of that court, this fact should be expressly
stated. The Conference directed that the report be received and
that it be circulated throughout the judiciary for the information
of the judges.
              CoMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS

   Judge Maris, Chairman of the Committee on Revision of the
Laws, submitted an interim report. The Committee believes that
it would be desirable to permit administrative agencies whose or­
ders are to be reviewed by a court of appeals to send to the court
an abbreviated record where the whole record is not necessary and
to authorize the use of the originafpapers in lieu of a transcript, the
papers to be returned to the agency upon the completion of the
review proceedings. This would require an amendment of exist­
ing statutes. The Committee has prepared a tentative draft of a
bill for this purpose and recommended that it be authorized to sub­
mit the draft to. the circuit judges and the agencies concerned for
                                 26 

their consideration and suggestions. The Committee also recom-           •
mended that the President's conference on administrative pro-            ¥
cedure be requested to consider the proposal and give the Commit­
tee its suggestions. In the light of such consideration and sugges­
tions received, the Committee would plan to present a definitive
draft of bill to a later session of the Conference. The Conference
authorized and requested the Committee to include in its tentative
draft provisions covering petitions for enforcement of adminis­
trative agency orders as well as proceedings to review such orders,
and with this amendment·it authorized the circulation of the draft
in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee.
RULES ADOPTED BY COURTS OF ApPEAL~ FOR REVIEW OR ENFORCE­
         MENT OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

  Section 11 of Public Law 901 of the Eighty-first Congress ap­
proved December 29, 1950 (64 Stat. 1129; 5 U. S. C. Supp. V,
1041), provides for the adoption, subject to the approval of the
Judicial Conference, of rules governing the practice and procedure
in proceedings to review or enforce orders of certain administrative
agencies. The Conference approved a rule adopted by the Court
of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit pursuant to this provision.             ¢
PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS OF ApPEALS OF THE
                  EIGHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS

  At the request of Chief Judge Gardner, the Conference, pur­
suant to Title 28, U. S. C. 48, consented that terms of the Court
of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be
pretermitted during the current fiscal year.
  At the request of Chief Judge Phillips, the Conference consented
that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit at Okla­
homa City be pretermitted during the current fiscal year.
        PROPOSAL TO ASSIGN CIRCUIT JUDGES TO COURT OF
                        MILITARY AI>PEALS

  The Conference disapproved the part of R.R. 579'4 which would
provide that if any judge of the Court of Military Appeals is tem­
porarily unable to perform his duties because of illness or other
disability, the President may designate a judge of the United
States Court of Appeals to fillthe office forthe period of disability.
                                            27
                                   HABEAS CORPUS

       The Conference directed that the former Committee on Habeas
     Corpus be reactivated for the purpose of considering the questions
     with regard to the use of the writ of habeas corpus to which ref­
     erence was made by the Attorney General in his report to the
     Conference. Judge Phillips and District Judge Frank A. Hooper
     were appointed as members of the Committee in place of Circuit
     Judge Kimbrough Stone, retired, and District Judge E. Marvin
     Underwood, retired.
     ApPEALS FROM INTERWCUTORY ORDERS OF THE DISTRICT COURTS

        Judge Parker, who is the Chairman of the Committee appointed
     to study proposals to enlarge the scope of appeals from inter­
     locutory orders of the district courts presented the report of his
     Committee. He told the Conference that the various proposals
     on this subject which had been suggested, and the views of the
     district and circuit judges and of the Conferences of the various
     circuits which had studied the matter had been considered by the
     Committee and that the Committee had come to the unanimous
r    conclusion that provision should be made for the allowance of
~    appeals from interlocutory orders in those exceptional cases where
     it is desirable that this be done to avoid unnecessary delay and
     expense and that the danger of opening the door to groundless ap­
     peals and piecemeal litigation can be avoided by proper limitations
     to be included in the amendatory statute.
        Accordingly the Committee recommended and submitted to the
     Conference a proposed amendment to Section 1292 of Title 28 of
      the United States Code reading as follows:
       Section 1292 of Title 28 of the United States Code is hereby amended by in­
     sertion of the letter (a) at the beginning of the section and adding at the end
     thereof an additional subparagraph lettered (b) to read as follows:
        (b) When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise
     appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves
     a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference
     of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially ad­
     vance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in
     such order. The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an
     appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within ten days
     after the entry of the order j provided, however, that application for an appeal
     hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district
     judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order.


-

                                    28 

  The Committee expressed the view that this proposed procedure
would be used only in those exceptional cases where a decision of
the appeal may avoid protracted and expensive litigation, as in
antitrust and similar protracted cases, where a question which
would be dispositive of the litigation is raised and there is serious
doubt as to how it should be decided. It pointed out that the right
to appeal given by its proposal is limited both by the requirement
of certificate of the trial judge, who will not countenance dilatory
tactics, and the resting of final discretion in the courts of appeals
which will not permit its dockets to be crowded with piecemeal or
minor litigation.
  The Conference approved the recommendation of the Commit·
tee. Judge Stephens and Judge Magruder voted in opposition to
the proposal of the Committee, and Judge Stephens requested that
their position in the matter be recorded in the report of the Confer·
ence.
        QUARTERS OF THE CoURTS AND RELATED FACILITIES

   Hon. W. E. Reynolds, Commissioner of the Public Buildings
Service, discussed with the Conference problems concerning pro­
vision of quarters for additional judges, the need for space for other
governmental activities, difficulties of maintenance of public build­
ings in view of budgetary limitations, and the need for air condi­
tioning of court quarters. He informed the Conference that budget
estimates are being prepared by the Public Buildings Service to
include funds for air conditioning the courts and the repair and
maintenance of public buildings. The Conference again pointed
out the urgency of air conditioning court quarters to permit their
use during summer months since the steady increase in business of
the Federal courts requires their operation during the summer.
ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEPARATE DOMESTIC RELATIONS CoURT FOR
                      THE DISTRICT OF CoLUMBIA

  The Conference adopted the following resolution:
  Resolved, that the Judicial Conference of the United States reaffirms its
approval of the creation in the Distriet of Columbia of a separate court for
the handling of domestic relations cases and matters pertaining to them; and
recommends that legislation providing for this separation be promptly enacted
by the Congress of the United States.
                                                 29 

            The Conference represents to Congress that unless this separation of business
,\"""],.1 	 as recommended is accomplished at an early date, three additional judges will
          be required and should be authorized by Congress for the United States District
          Court for the District of Columbia.

                MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES IN CRIMINAL CASES

             Judge Stephens presented to the Conference the following resolu­
          tion adopted by the Judicial C<>nference of the District of Columbia
          Circuit June 12, 1953:
            It is resolved by the members of the Judicial Conference of the District of
          Columbia Circuit (to wit, the Judges of the United States District Court for the
          District of COlumbia and the Judges of the United States Court of Appeals for
          the District of Columbia Circuit) that they oppose enactment of those provisions
          of H. R. 5312, S3d Congress, and S. 1946, 83d Congress, which compel the Judges
          of the District Court to impose minimum sentences in certain classes of cases,
          which deny such Judges the right to place certain def{'ndants on probation and
          the right to admit certain defendants to parole, and which bring about, in effect,
          repeal of certain provisions of the Federal Youth Correction Act as it was made
          applicable to the District of Columbia.
            And it is further resolved that copies of this resolution be presented to the
          Judicial Conference of the United States and to the appropriate Committees of
          Congress.
            After the adoption of this resolution, the House bill (H. R. 5312)
          was amended in a way to lessen although not to eliminate alto­
          gether the provisions to which objection is expressed by the reso­
          lution. As amended, the bill was enacted as Public Law 85, ap­
          proved June 29, 1953. The Conference approved the resolution
          adopted by the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia
          Circuit.
                  REVOCATION OF RADIO STATION LICENSES,                H. R. 3977
             Judge Stephens presented the following resolution adopted by
           the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit June
           12, 1953:
             It is resolved by the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit
           that it opposes the enactment of H. R. 3977, 83d Congress, a bill to provide that
           radio station licenses shall be issued for an indefinite term and shall be revoked
           only by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with an
           appeal therefrom to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
           Columbia Circuit, and with review by certiorari.
             The Conference approved the resolution.

JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CERTAIN ORDERS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITY
                               ADMINISTRATOR

  Judge Stephens presented the following resolutions adopted by
the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit oppos­
ing the enactment of H. R. 4277 and H. R. 4901 of the Eighty­
third Congress:
  It is resolved by the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia CircuIt
that it opposes the enactment of H. R. 4277, 83d Congress, a bill which, inter
alia, gives the United States District Court for the District of Columbia exclu­
sive jurisdiction over appeals from orders of the Federal Security Administra­
tor under the Federal Food, Drugs and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act of 1947 with respect to applications for the registration of a
pesticIde or with respect to a regulation establishing a tolerance for a pesticide
or exempting the pesticide therefrom.
  It is resolved by the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit
that it opposes the enactment of H. R. 4901, 83d Congress, 1st session, a bill to
amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
  These bills provide for review of administrative orders which
would be issued under the proposed acts by de novo trials in United
States District Courts instead of review in the United States Court
of Appeals on the record made before the administrative agency.
The Conference approved the action of the Judicial Conference
of the District of Columbia Circuit in opposing these provisions of
the bills.

     THE COSTS OF ApPEAL INCLUDING THE COST OF PRINTING

   The Administrative Office reported that the first draft of a sur­
vey report concerning the costs of appeal including the cost of
printing had been completed and permission was given to circulate
it to the circuit judges and clerks for suggestions before the issuance
of a final report.
                                 COMMITTEES

  The Conference renewed the authorization to the Chief Justice
to take whatever action he deemed desirable with respect to in­
creasing the membership of existing committees, the filling of com­
mittee vacancies, and the appointment of new committees. Sub­
ject to such action existing committees were continued. The Con­
ference continued the Advisory Committee consisting of the Chief
Justice and Chief Judges Stephens, Biggs, Parker, and Phillips, to
advise and assist the Director in the performance of his duties.
                                31

  The Conference declared a recess, subject to the call of the Chief
Justice.
  For the Judicial Conference of the United States:

               Senior Associate Justice, Acting Chief Justice.
  Dated Washington, D. C., October 2, 1953.
                            APPENDIX
   REPORT OF HONORABLE HERBERT BROWNELL, JR., ATTORNEY
                  GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES

Mr. Acting Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference of
      the United States:
   It is with a deep sense of sorrow in the irreparable loss of the past
chairman of this Conference, the late Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson,
that I open my first report to you. Chief Justice Vinson graced
the high court with dignity, vigor, and assurance. He gave to the
Judicial Conference active leadership and wise guidance, and con­
tributed to the growing stature which the Judicial Conference has
assumed in the administration of the affairs of the federal judiciary.
   With your permission, I would like to depart from a practice of
the past and avoid reviewing the great variety of subjects and
happenings affecting the Department of Justice and the courts.
Instead, I would like to concentrate upon a selected few.
   I have been encouraged in this course by the late Chief Justice
and by Judge Parker, both of whom asked me at the last meeting
of the Judicial Conference of the Fourth Circuit to report to this
body on two subjects, namely (1) what should be the position of the
court, the prosecutor, and the grand jury in regard to requests by
persons under investigation by a grand jury to appear voluntarily
before the inquest, and (2) should there be a public defender sys­
tem for the representation of indigents in federal criminal cases
or should assigned counsel be compensated.

                                   I
  Voluntary Appearances by Defendants Before Grand Juries.­
On the first subject-Voluntary Appearances by Defendants Be­
fore Grand Juries-a bill was introduced in the 83d Congress (S.
1801) which would amend Section 1504 of 18 U. S. C., relating to
communications addressed to grand or petit juries by authorizing
any person under investigation by a Federal grand jury to make
written requests to the foreman thereof or to the chief prosecutor
                                  (82) 

                                  33 

in charge to appear before the grand jury. If the foreman or
prosecutor should fail to bring the request to the attention of the
grand jury during its deliberations he would be subject to a fine of
$1,000 or imprisonment of 6 months, or both. There has been
no action on this bill. In 1933, after a long period of agitation,
the grand jury was abolished in England, except for a very few
kinds of cases. Many of the States in this country have done like­
wise. Nevertheless, in the Federal courts and the courts of at least
half of the States, the grand jury remains a part of the judicial
system for criminal cases. It has won both condemnation and
praise. Some, like the Wickersham Crime Commission in its 1931
report on prosecution, argued that we might do better without the
instrument of the grand jury. Others have urged that it would be
the height of folly, in an era of expanding executive power, to
eliminate the grand jury which stands as a bulwark against pos­
sible executive tyranny.
   I think it is needless for us to debate the merits of either position.
We should consider, in the prospect of the continued existence of
the grand jury system in the Federal courts, how to make it work
well.
   This leads to the matter of whether or not a person who knows
that he is under investigation by a grand jury may voluntarily
seek and obtain the privilege of appearing before the inquest to
speak in his own favor. We know that in the Federal courts the
defendant has no right to appear and be heard or present witnesses
in his favor. (Duke v. United States, 90 F. 2d 840, cert. den. 302
 U. S. 685.) Long ago it was pointed out by Chief Justice McKean
sitting in a Pennsylvania court (1 Dallas 236), that to permit such
 a proceeding would be to usurp the province of the petit jury to
 determine on the whole evidence, for as well as against him whether
 the defendant is or is not guilty; further, that such procedure might
 result in twice putting the defendant in jeopardy for the same
 offense. The rule has been restated and followed in the Federal
 courts by Chief Justice Taney (30 Fed. Cas. 998) and others down
 to contemporary times. At least one State, New York, deviates
 from this rule, by statute. Under a 1940 amendment to section
 257 of New York's Code of Criminal Procedure, a person, who has
 reason to believe that a grand jury is investigating a charge that
 he has committed a crime, may voluntarily file with the foreman
 of the grand jury and the district attorney a request to be heard
                                       34 

before the grand jury. In such case, the grand jury must give the
individual, if he files a waiver of immunity, an opportunity to be
heard before finding an indictment, although the grand jury need
not hear any witness on his behalf. An indictment found in viola­
tion of this provision of law may be voided.
   However, the opportunity to be heard which N ew York affords
to prospective defendants as a matter of right, is the unusual case.
The more usual rule is that set forth in the American Law Institute
Code of criminal Procedure, section 139. It is there stated:
  The grand jurors are under no duty to hear evidence for the defendant, but
may do so. They shall weigh all the evidence received by them and when they
have reasonable ground to believe that other evidence, which is available, will
explain away the charge they may require the same to be produced.
  The commentary to section 139 indicates that this is the law in
most of the grand jury States by statute. I think it will be agreed
that, although there is no equivalent Federal statute, the rule in
the case of Federal grand juries is about the same. Many years ago,
Mr. Justice Field in his famous charge to the grand jury for the
Circuit Court of the California District said:
  From these observations, it will be seen, gentlemen, that there is a double duty
cast upon you as grand jurors of this district; one a duty to the government, or
more properly speaking, to society, to see that parties against whom there is just
ground to charge the commission of crime, shall be held to answer the charge;
and on the other hand, a duty to the citizen to see that he is not subjected to
prosecution upon accusations having no better foundation than public clamor
or private malice. ... ... ...
  If, in the course of your inquiries, you have reason to believe that there is
other evidence, not presented to you, within your reach, which would qualify
or explain away the charge under investigation, it will be your duty to order
such evidence to be produced. Formerly, it was held that an indictment might
be found if evidence were produced sufficient to render the truth of the charge
probable. But a different and a more just and merciful rule now prevails. To
justify the finding of an indictment, you must be convinced, so far as the evidence
before you goes, that the accused is guilty-in other words, you ought not to
find an indictment unless, in your judgment, the evidence before you, unexplained
and uncontradicted, would warrant a conviction by a petit jury (30 Fed. Cas.
992).
  Our courts have ruled many times against appearances by pro­
spective defendants as a matter of right, but have said very little
on the subject of voluntary appearances as a matter of grace. In
1944, Judge Learned Hand noted in an opinion (144 F. 2d 604,605)
that grand juries have in recent times occasionally invited persons,
whose conduct they are examining, to appear. In addition, Con­
gress made it clear in 1948, in the amendment which was added to
J                                         35

    section 1504, title 18 U. S. C.that this practice is approved. You
    will recall that section 1504 makes punishable any attempts to in­
    fluence the action of grand and petit jurors. The amendment pro­
    vides that the section shall not be construed to prohibit the com­
    munication of a request to appear before the grand jury.
       Such being the permissible practice, what should be the attitude­
    of the grand jury, the court, and the prosecutor when such requests
    to appear voluntarily are made?
        If, as the Supreme Court has said, "the most valuable function
    of the grand jury was not only to examine into the commission of
    crimes, but to stand between the prosecutor and the accused, and
    to determine whether the charge was founded upon credible testi­
    mony or dictated by malice or personal ill-will," it seems to me
    there can be and should be no hard and fast rule excluding volun­
    tary appearances by defendants before Federal grand juries. All
     three functionaries-the grand jury, the court, and the United
    States Attorney-are interested in the accomplishment of justice
    and the avoidance of persecution. All three may have a common
    interest in permitting a prospective defendant to voluntarily tes­
     tify before a grand jury.
        In some cases, the defendant's testimony may even strengthen
     the Government's case. In other cases, where the United States
     Attorney is able to present a prima facie case to the grand jury
     which uncontroverted might be sufficient for an indictment, it may
     be that a mere statement by the defendant of completely exculpat­
     ing circumstances would result in a different result and a saving in
     time and money to the Government as well as possible irreparahle
     damage to the reputation of the defendant.
        Recently, Chief Judge Sterling Hutcheson of the Eastern Dis­
     trict of Virginia wrote us out of his experience on the subject.Re­
     garding his conclusions on the position to be taken by the court, the
     prosecutor, and the grand jury, I could render no greater service
     than to read to you four brief paragraphs from his letter. He says:
      Circumstances vary and each case should be handled in accordance with the
    peculiar circumstances. It Is a practice which should not be encouraged. At the
    same time it should be borne in mind that an indictment is not di1Ilcult to obtain
    and when improperly obtained can cause great injustice. * * * If the United
    States Attorney. present with the right of cross examination in the absence of
    counsel for the defendant, is unable to obtain an indictment before a grand jury.
    the case of the Government can not be very strong. It is also to be remembered
    that the action of the grand jury is in no sense re8 adjudicata and the case may
    be. presented to an unlimited number of other grand juries.
                                         36 

    One important consideration is that since grand juries consist of laymen un~         ~.',:
 fjlmiliar with legal principles and only infrequently called to act, it is a body       .,~
 peculiarly likely to relinquish its authority and fail to meet its responsibility un·
 less these are clearly brought to the attention of the members.
    I do not believe there is danger that the hearing will develop into a trial of
 the charge on the merits. Members of the grand juries with whom I have been
 in contact, with few exceptions, indicate an earnest desire to give full and fair
 consideration to matters before them, but they are content to do no more than
 discharge their re8ponsibility and leave the burden of determining guilt where
 It belongs.
    It is my opinion that .the answer to the question is care in the selection of
,jurors, the appointment of a level·headed, intelligent foreman, a full and care­
 ful 'charge concerning the duties of the members and from that point the jury
,should reach its own decision. I believe that with few exceptions, a wise and
,sound conclusion will be reached. I do not mean to indicate that the United
 States Attorney should not render assistance by pointing out pertinent mat·
 tel's, explaining the di:lference between competent evidence and that which would
,be rejected at the trial, and acting generally as the advisor of the grand jury.
As previously mentioned, if Government counsel believes an error has been
:.made the case can usually be presented to another jury.
    Briefly summed up, it is my feeling that the grand jury system should be
,strengthened wherever practicable and nothing should be done to weaken it.
    I might add that Judge Hutcheson has related some of his per,:,
,sonal experiences; A recent one in the February 1952 term in his
 district will be of interest to you. When the grand jury was con­
Vened, he says, he charged it fully concerning its responsibilities                      6JI
:and the power vested in it. The jury was informed of requests to
,appear that had been made by prospective defendants, and he
'made clear that the grand jury must determine whether such testi­
 mony would be received. The individuals requesting permission
to appear were informed in open court of their constitutional
'rights and were advised that, in the event they testified, any state­
 ment made might be used against them. All this was done with
{he court reporter in attendance. The judge made no recommen­
"dation, stating however, that either the court or the United States
 Attorney had the right to make a recommendation if either deemed
'it advisable. Of the 10 individuals who requested permission, the
 grand jury agreed to hear only 1. He alone was indicted and
:subsequently convicted.
    To conclude this point, I would like to see gathered,' possibly
 by a committee of this Conference or by the Administrative Office,
information on the experiences in the several districts. If there is
 a wide disparity in practices, it may be that a simple information

      The Public Defender System and Compensation oj Assigned
   Counsel.-The public defender, as a means of providing adequate
   counsel for indigent defendants in criminal cases, is no longer a
   matter of mere speculation in this country. In addition to the
   voluntary systems that have existed in some communities, nine
   States plus Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone have provided by law
   for a public defender system. Two of the States, Connecticut and
   Rhode Island, provide effective Statewide coverage. The Ameri­
   can Bar Association Standing Committee on Legal Aid Work re­
   ported this year that there are now functioning 38 public and vol­
   untary defenders. To our knowledge, 26 of these have been gov­
   ernmentally established in State, county, or city systems. I
   thought it would be useful for the Conference to know about this
   group of officers. Hence, I am submitting as an annex to this
   paper, a summary of salient facts about the jurisdiction, appoint­
   ment, tenure and salary of each.
      The American Bar Association Standing Committee on Legal
   Aid Work recently adopted a six point program which was evolved
IS as the result of the thorough legal aid study made for the Survey
   of the Legal Profession. Points 5 and 6 of the program provide:
       5. In all of the larger cities,there sbould be an organized Defender service
     for criminal cases, conducted eitber as a coordinate function of a legal aid office
     or as an independent publicly or privately supported agency, to provide com­
     petent counsel at every stage of the· proceedings, in all felony cases and other
     serious offenses.
       6. Adequately compensated assigned counsel, of equivalent character and cov­
     erage, should be provided in all counties not served by a Defender office.
        It is, indeed, an anomaly that the Federal courts operating under
     the strong and strict guarantee of counsel for all defendants in
     criminal cases under the Sixth Amendment, have had to limp along
     with nothing comparable to the public defender in indigent cases,
     particularly in the populous districts. This has not been from in­
     attention to the subject by the judges or the attorneys general.
     Since 1937, both the Judicial Conference and the Department of
     Justice have endorsed and urged the enactment of legislation
     which would authorize the appointment of public defenders in the
     districts where the amount of business justifies the appointment,
     and the allowance of compensation to assigned counsel in the other
     districts. These have been the recommendations of the Judicial
                                      38 

Conference under the chairmanship of Chief Justices Hughes,
Stone, and Vinson, and of the Attorneys General since Homer
Cummings.
   I am happy to add my endorsement to these recommendations.
I pledge that my Department will do all that it can to advance the
necessary proposals for legislation.
   In this connection, I might describe briefly the two pending
proposals in the 83d Congress, H. R. 398 and H. R. 2091. H. R.
398 is identical with bills in the last, two Congresses which were
supported by both the Judicial Conference and the Department.
Both H. R. 398 and H. R. 2091 would provide for the appointment
by the several district courts of the United States of public de­
fenders either as full-time or part-time officers as the volume of
work, in the judgment of the respective courts, may require. Sal­
aries would be based upon the services to be performed, in no
case exceeding $10,000 per year, to be fixed by the Judicial Con­
ference of the United States. In districts that do not contain a
city of over 500,000 population, where the court considers that
representation of the indigent can be more economical by the ap­
pointment of counsel in individual cases, and no public defender
is appointed, assigned counsel may be compensated at a rate not
to exceed $35 per day, plus expenses, for time necessarily and
properly spent in preparation and triaL The same could also be
done in a district with a city of over 500,000 popUlation if the
judicial council of the circuit approves and no public defender is
appointed. H. R. 2091 would vary this slightly by making the
controlling population figure 300,000 and the maximum compen­
sation $40 per day. Both measures have a $5,000 ceiling on the
amount to be spent in compensating appointed counsel in the dis­
trict in any fiscal year.
   Thus, under either bill the way would be open to make use of
the best that can be derived from both the public defender and
assigned counsel systems.
   There is, of course, no need for me to emphasize with the Judicial
Conference the desirability of the regularized public defender in the
largely populated districts. I need only recall the report to this
Conference in 1943 by Judge Augustus N. Hand, for the committeb
on indigent litigants, in which he said:
  To call on. lawyers constantly for unpaid service is unfair to them and any
attempt to do so is almost bound to break down after a time. To distribute such
assignments among a large number of attorneys in order to reduce the burden
~IL--,
~       _
               upon anyone, is to entrust- the represen::tion of the defendant to attorneys who
               in many cases are not proficient in criminal trials, whatever their general ability,
               and who for one reason or another cannot be depended upon for an adequate
               defense. Too often under such circumstances the representation becomes little
               mOre than a form.      '
            In the less popUlated districts, where assigned counsel can suffi­
         ciently meet the problem of representing indigents, the difficulty
         is to find the most equitable means ofcompeilsating assigned coun­
         sel. On the one hand, a nominal suin might encourage counsel
         to urge pleas of guilty or tohurry the disposition of cases without
         adequate investigation of the facts. On the other hand, the per
         diem method of compensation inight tempt the court-appointed
         counsel to prolong a case, resulting in unnecessary expense and
         delay. However, with the court in control, it seems tome that the
         per diem method offers the flexibility which would permit adjust­
         mentsin accordance with particUlar needs and, in most cases, result
         in more effecti~e representation of the rights of the indigent per­
         son. It may be difficult at the outset to arrive at the best formula
         for fixing compensation. It would seem to me, however, that if
         the principle of compensation can be established by legislation,
       ~ adjustments can and will be made in due course.            "


                . Habeas Corpus Review of State Court Convictions.-Recently
               the Federalhabeas corpus examinatiop of State criminal court con­
               victions has been the subject of criticism, The Conference of Chief
               Justices and the NationalAssociation of Attorneys General ofthe
               States have urged that there be a limit upon the review of State
               court convictions by the lower Federal courts.
                  As you well know, the use of the wri,t of habeas corpus in the
               Federal courts to test the constitutional validity of a conviction for
               crime is not restricted to those cases where the judgment of con­
               viction is void for want of jurisdiction of the trial court to render it.
               The use extends also to those exceptional cases where the convic­
               tion has been in disregard of the constitutional rights of the accused
               and where the writ is the only effective means of preserving his
               rights. The result has been that _prisoners, who have exhausted
               their State court remedies and unsuccessfully sought certiorari in
i,\l           the Supreme Court of the United States (Darrv.Burford, 339 U. S.
,I     .....   200), may file petitionsfoF habeas corpus in the Federal district
                               40 

courts raising the same questions which were or could have been _
raised in the State courts. Most of the claims raised in petitions ' ,
of this sort have dealt with alleged denials of the right to counsel,
coerced or fraudulent confessions, and other influences not con­
ducive to a fair trial.
   A study of this category of petitions filed in the district courts
has been made by the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts covering the last 12 years. It indicates that about 500 peti­
tions have been filed each year. However, in only a small number
of cases were the petitioners successful. The record of the last 4
years shows that only 29 petitions were granted, and that out of
that number only 4 petitioners won their ultimate release from
State penit,entiaries. However, about 85 percent of the petitions
filed required the time and attention of the district courts by deci­
sion before trial or by trial with evidence introduced; and approx'!'
imately 10 percent of those filed resulted in appeals to the courts
of appeals. The effect has been to burden the Federal courts with
a duplication of judicial action and to prolong the final determina­
tion of criminal cases, contrary to the public interest. State offi­
cials, although recognizing the propriety and constitutional neces- . .
sity of review of State court convictions by the United States Su- WJ
preme Court, assert, with some reason, that it is inappropriate for
Federal district courts to engage in a process which in fact consti­
tutes a review of State appellate court decisions. The difficulty is
to balance these public interest considerations against the need and
importance of maintaining the availability of the writ as a protec­
 tion of individual liberty, if only in a few cases.   .
    A good deal of light has been shed upon the problem hy it recent
study and report, dated June 1953, by the Committee on Habeas
 Corpus of the Conference of Chief Justices. The Committeere­
ported that "responsibility for the unfortunate conditions prevail:.
 ing in habeas corpus litigation rests upon the state as well as upori
 the Federal judicial systems and the evils presently prevailing can
 be reduced substantially by action taken at the state level." The
Committee recommended, and the Conference of Chief Justices as
 a whole concurred on August 22, 1953, that the state legislatures
 or judicial rule-making bodies consider the taking of seven meas­
 ures. In: brief, these measures 'would assure that the post-con;..
 viction process of the state is at least as broad in scope as the t)~
 procedure for testing claims of constitutional rights in the Federal
L                                    41


    courts under the Federal habeas corpus statute. Further, they
    would establish practices which will produce a complete record in
    each case showing consideration and disposition on the merits of
    claimed Federal constitutional rights.
      The suggestions are extremely useful and far-sighted. In part,
    they bear out the view of the Administrative Office that a large
    percentage of the petitions in previous years have emanated from
    a few states where there has been an alleged lack of an adequate
    and effective habeas corpus or similar procedure in the state courts.
    On the whole, the recommendations indicate the wisdom and
    moderation of the chief justices in suggesting that the states put
    their houses in order.
      On the Federal side, the Committee of Chief Justices had a sug­
    gestion for amending some of the sections of title 28 of the United
    States Code relating to the writ of habeas corpus. You will recall
    that the Supreme Court's most recent decision on the subject,
    Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, decided in February of this year,
    emphasized that the practice which permits State prisoners to
    apply to the lower Federal courts for relief by habeas corpus i~
    required by the present habeas corpus statute, in particular, 28
    U. S. C. 2254. The Committee of Chief Justices has suggested
    amendments, which would not take the lower courts entirely.out of
    the picture, but would permit them to act only if the United States
    Supreme Court, in denying relief on the review sought of the state
    proceedings, expressly reserves the right of the prisoner to apply
    for habeas corpus to a district or circuit judge upon the issues pre­
    sented to the Supreme Court. The Committee felt that this pro­
    prosal would be a more readily acceptable means of dealing with
    the Federal side of the problem, since the Supreme Court would
    probably oppose an amendment placing upon it the whole burden
    of disposing of these cases. And, I might add, the limited con­
    sideration which the Supreme Court can give to a case in passing
    upon a petition for· certiorari might not be regarded as sufficient
    Feder.al protection.
      However, it does not appear that the whole of the Conference
    of Chief Justices endorsed this portion of the Committee report.
    Instead, the resolution of August 22, 1953, after adopting Elnd en­
    dorsing the state side of the report, reaffirms an earlier resolution
    of September 1952, which favored subjecting a final judgment of
    a State's highest court to review or reversal only by the Supreme
                                 42 


Court of the United States. Presumably; this proposal also en­
tails an amendment of the statute.
   Still another form of statutory amendment might be the pro­
posal implicit in Mr. Justice Jackson's concurring views in Brown
v. Allen. This would exclude lower federal court entertainment
of a petition unless the state law allowed no access to its courts on
the constitutional point raised; or the petition showed that, al­
though the law allows a remedy, the petitioner was improperly
obstructed from making a record upon which the question could
be preSented.
   I mention these several suggestions for Federal action because
it seems to me that this is a problem for the Judicial Conference
in the first instance. The Conference played an important role in
the drafting of the present statute. It would undoubtedly be con­
cerned with any amendments. I might also say that the section
on Judicial Administration of the American Bar Association, com­
posed of both Federal and State judges, has commended the Con­
ference of Chief Justices of the States Jor its practical approach to
the total solution of the problem, and has likewise suggested that
the ·Judicial Conference examine into the matter.
   ludicial Review in place of Habeas Corpus in Deportation              0)
Cases.-The phase of Federal habeas corpus jurisdiction which, in
my opinion, is ripe for legislative revision has to do with the review
of deportation orders. The recent decision in Heikkila v. Barber
(345 U. s. 229) held habeas corpus proceedings to be the exclu'"
sive method for reviewing deportation orders issued under the
1917 Immigration Act, notwithstanding the broad judicial review
contemplated by section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act
and notwithstanding the Declaratory Judgment Act. Under the
new Immigration and Nationality Act Of 1952, however, the issue
is up again. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,
in Rubinstein v. Brownell, held on June 11, 1953, that deportation
orders under the new act may be reviewed in an action for declara...i
tory and injunctive relief. While the Government has filed a peti­
tion for a writ of certiorari in this case, we think the Congress
should spell out a method of obtaining judicial review in the dis­
trict court for any alien against whom a final order of deportation
has been issued, whether he is in custody or not. Such legislation
would provide an opportunity to specify appropriate venue pro­             ~
                                                      in
visions, which could avoid a concentration of cases the District         tJ~,
                                  43 


of Columbia; and might also provide, insofar as is constitutionally
possible, against a duplication of procedures.
   Regarding the scope of review, it is doubtful whether the scope
is now any different in habeas corpus from that which is accorded
to the orders of other agencies under section 10 of the Administra­
tive Procedure Act. In spite of the formal differences between
habeas corpus and statutory review referred to in the H e:ikldla
opinion (345 U. S. at 236), it looked as though the Supreme Court
had applied the substantial evidence rule in Bridges v. Wixon?
326 U. S. 133, and several lower courts have expressly stated that
deportation orders must be. supported by substantial evidence.
Section 242 (b) of the J.mmigration and Nationality Act provides
that Hno decision of deportability shall be valid unless it is based
upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence." It is
quite likely that the courts will analogize this direction to ,the con.;
cept of "substantial evidence" upon the whole record found· in
section 10 (e) of the Administrative Procedure Act. In short,
making deportation orders subject to judicial review in accordance
with section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act would have
little or no effect upon the scope of review given to such orders
anyway.
  •On the other hand, by providing a remedy other than habeas
corpus it will be possible for one against whom a deportation order
is outstanding, but whois not in physical custody, to obtain at once
 judieial review of the deportation order which is administratively
final.' As Mr. Justice Frankfurter observed in contending for this
result in his dissent in Heikldlav. Barber: "The point is legally
 narrow but practically important."
   Concerning Judges.-While President Eisenhower has a,ppointed
 9 district court judges in the 8 months since January 20, 1953, the
 matter of providing for additional judges to help carry the tre­
 mendous load of judicial business still rests with the Congress.
 Different versions of S. 15 were passed by the Senate and H.ouse
 in the· recently adjourned session of the Congress. The Senate
 form of the bill would add 4 circuit judgeships and 35 district
 judgeships, of which 7 would be temporary. The House form of
 the bill provides for 3 circuit judgeships and 23 district judgeships,
 of which 4 would be temporary. The bill has gone to conference
 but·· the Congress adjourned before· an agreement was reached.
 Oddly,the Department of Justice·wag·not asked to report on S. 15.
                               44
However, in reporting on another bill (H. R. 2558) 'at the request ..,~
of the House Judiciary Committee, the Department made it clear ~
that it concurred in. the recommendations of the' Judicial Con­
ference for additional judgeships. I believe that; with the return
of Congress, S. 15 provides the basis for strengthening the Federal
judiciary.
    One disturbing difficulty with S. 15 is that it strikes out an
existing provision of law, subsection (c) of 28 U. S. C.371. Under
this subsection the President may appoint an additional judge
whenever a permanently disabled 'circuit or district judge eligible
to retire because of age and length of service, fails to do so. The
loss of this provision would be particularly regrettable, since the
Judicial Conference had recommended extending its scope to in­
clude all judges appointed to office during good behavior and to all
cases of judges eligible to retire on account of permanent disability
 (under 28 U. S. C. 372), even though they might not be eligible
to retire on account of age and length of service. The deletion
from the bill oBhe existing prov~sion of law occurred in the debate
onthe Senate floor. The bill has passed both Houses and gone to
conference without the provision. If there is any chance of cor­
recting this action before or after final passage of S. 15, I w(;mld f»)
hope that the Judicial Conference will be especially diligent. in
the matter.
    S. 15, as passed byboth Houses, would permit the retirement of
 judges at age 65 after 15 years service, as well as at age 70 after.
 10 years service now allowed under existing law. The Department
of Justice had an opportunity to concur in, and voiced its approval
'Of, this recommendation of the Judicial Conference in reporting on
a related House bill, H. R. 2559.
    The Department has gone on record and presented testimony in
favor of the increase of salaries of Federal judges, members of Con­
gress, and United States attorneys. ,As a first step, the Congress
has provided for a Commission on Judicial and Congressional Sal·
aries (P. L. 220, 83d Cong.), which is to determine appropriate
Tates of salaries for judges and members of Congress and report its
 findings on or before January 15, 1954.
    Curtailing of Nolo Contendere Pleas.-,-In assessing the practices
of government in relation to law enforcement, we recently con-
eluded that one of the factors which tended tobreed contempt for
Federal law ~nforcement was the practice of Federal prosecutors (~J
                                            45
 i '-~)   cO,nsenting, almo,at ~·a :na~ter of course, to the filing of pleas of nolo
",'"--lII contendere to crmunal mdictments.
             Uncontrolled use of the plea has resulted in shockingly low. sen­
          tences and inadequate fines which are no deterrent. to crime. The
          public impression created; and no doubt reflected by the courts in
          imposing punishment, is .that the Government in consenting to the
          plea has only a technical case at most.
             In many districts, the court will ordinarily not accept a nolo
          plea unless.consented to by the United States attorney. In other
          districts, where the plea may be accepted without the prosecuting
          attorney's consent, the responsibility for its acceptance, in the face
          ofa refusal to, consent, is squarely on the judge.
             In an etTort to discourage widespread use of the plea of nolo
          contendere, I recently instructed.,each United States attorney not
          to consent to the filing of sU.ch plea except in the most unusual
          circumstances and then only after his recommendation for its ac­
          ceptance had been reviewed and approved by the responsible As­
          sistant Attorney Generalor by my office.
             Enforcing the Conflict-of~Intere8.t Law.-Another factor which
          appears to have brought disrepute to Federal law enforcement has
   ::; been the practice of government employees entering private life
          or employment to engage in defending or prosecuting the claims
          or cases on which they worked while in government. The past con­
          doning of this practice has led to influence peddling and corruption,
          and to the equally devastating public belief that both exist on a
          wide scale.                            '
            A lawyer, whQ has held public office and who after leaving that
          office accepts employment on the other side in a matter which he
          investigated or passed upon while in office violates the canoneof
                                                        j


          ethics and may be subject to disbarment. And, in my view, he
          commits a crime. Section 284 of title 18 U. S. C. makes ita felony
          for an employee within 2 years after leaving Government service
          to act as counsel, attorneY, or agent in presenting any claim against
          the United States involving any subject matter with which he
          was directly connected when employed. The statute has never
          been judicially construed, but in my opinion it is nQt to be so
          narrowly read as to be limited to monetary claims or claims which
          seek affirmative relief against the Government. Its purpose also
          embraces nonmonetary claims, and claims asserted to defeat those

  --      of the Government.
                                  46

   I have accordingly advised the United States attorneys of my
position that the statute prohibits any former employee of the
Federal Government, for a period of 2 years after leaving Govern­
ment service, from representing any nongovernmental interest in
any matter involving a subject matter directly connected with
which such person was so employed or performed duty, in which
the United States is interested, directly or indirectly, whether as
a party, as an enforcement agent, or otherwise. I have instructed
the United States attorneys to vigorously prosecute violations of
section 284 as so construed.
   The President's Conference on Administrative Procedure.-The
final item to which I call your ,attention is the President's Confer­
ence on Administrative Procedure. '. This Conference was recently
appointed by President Eisenhower, upon the recommendation of
the Judicial Conference and myself, and consists of approximately
75 representatives of the Federal agencies, the judiciary, and the
bar.
   It is a unique cooperative effort to eliminate unnecessary delay,
expense, and size of records in administrative proceedings. At the
first meeting of the President's Conference, in June 1953 various
aspects of this problem were assigned to working committees for           fI)
study. At the same time, at my request, the Conference under­
took to explore the desirability of establishing an Office of Admin..
istrative Procedure to make continuing studies of administrative
procedures, and the feasibility of formulating uniform rules' of
procedure for Federal agencies. Subsequent meetings ·of the full
Conference willoonsider the reports and recommendations of its
working committees.
   The' administrative process has become so pervasive in our na­
tionallife that we can no longer afford to let. it develop haphazardly,
The forward step in the Administrative Procedure Act must be
followed by continuous study and effort to establish and maintain
procedures which will be fair to the individual and effective to carry
out the regulatory policies laid down by Congress.! am confident
that the President's Conference on Administrative Procedure will
demonstrate that the kind of cooperative effort which produced the
Federal rules of civil and criminal procedure can also greatly im­
prove our administrative procedures.
