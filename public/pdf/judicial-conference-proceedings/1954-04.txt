                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS RECOMMENDED

           The Conference reaffirmed its previous recommendations with
        respect to the creation of additional judgeships which were not
        included in Public Law 294, 83d Congress, approved February
        10, 1954. After reviewing the needs of the courts, the Conference
        also recommended the creation of the following additional
        judgeships:
             1 additional district judgeship for the Eastern District of
               Louisiana.
             1 additional district judgeship for the District of Kansas.
           A complete list of the present Judicial Conference recommenda­

        tions with respect to judgeships (other than circuit judgeships for 

         the Ninth Circuit and the proposed Eleventh Circuit hereafter 

        referred to) follows: 

        District Courts: 

             Second Judicial Circuit-Southern District of New York.­
               The creation of 3 additional judgeships, with a proviso that
                the first 2 vacancies occurring in this district shall not be
                filled.
              Third Judicial Circuit-Eastern District of Pennsylvania.­
                The creation of one additional judgeship.

          Eastern District of Louisiana.-The creation of one additional

            creation of one additional jUdgeship.
          Eighth Judicial Circuit-Northern and Southern Districts of

            tional judgeship.
          Tenth Judicial Circuit-District of Kansas.-The creation of
            one additional judgeship.
                   DISAPPROVAL OF PROPOSED JUDGESHIP

        The Conference disapproved a proposal to create at this time
      an additional judgeship for the Western District of Louisiana.
      DIVISION OF 'l'HE NINTH CIRCUIT AND CREATION OF THE ELEVENTH
              CIRCUIT OUT OF THE NORTHERN PART THEREOF

r-.     After considering the increasing volume of business in the Ninth
__ 	 Circuit, and the number of judges required to dispatch that busi­
     ness, the rapid growth of population in the States and Territories
     embraced in the circuit, and the very large geographical area of the
     circuit as presently constituted, the Conference reached the con­
     clusion that the circuit ought to be divided. It is proposed that
     the Ninth Circuit consist of Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii,
     and Nevada, and have 8 judges (7 permanent and 1 temporary)
     who would sit at San Francisco and Los Angeles. The new
     eleventh circuit would include Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon,
     and Washington, and have 4 judges who would sit at Seattle and
     Portland.
        The Conference recommended a form of bill for the purpose.
      ApPOINTMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL JUDGE WHEN A DISABLED JUDGE
                              FAILS To RETIRE

         Prior to the enactment of Public Law 294, sad Congress, ap­
      proved February 10, 1954, subsection (c) of section 371 of Title
      28, United States Code, provided that whenever a circuit or dis­
      trict judge who was eligible to retire on account of age and length
-	    of service failed to do so and the President should find that he
                                 4


was unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by
reason of permanent mental or physical disability and that the
appointment of an additional judge was necessary for the efficient
                                                                        -
dispatch of business, the President could make such an appoint­
ment by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The
judge whose disability caused the appointment of an additional
judge was for purposes of precedence, service as chief judge, or
temporary performance of the duties of that office, to be treated
as junior in commission to the other judges of the circuit or dis­
trict. The vacancy subsequently caused by the death, resigna­
tion or retirement of the disabled judge was not to be filled.
   The Judicial Conference had recommended certain amendments
to this law which had been incorporated in the bill (S. 15) which
became Public Law 294 (Repts. March sess. 1952, p. 16-17, Sept.
sess. 1952, p. 18-19, Sept. sess. 1953, p. 22-23). But during the
course of the consideration of the bill by Congress an amendment
was adopted which had the effect of repealing the entire subsec­
tion so that there is now no authority for the appointment of an
additional judge when a disabled judge fails to retire. S. 2910
presently pending in the Senate would restore the repealed statute
but without the amendments recommended by the Conference.
    The Conference renewed its prior recommendation, and now rec­
ommends that the repealed law be reenacted with the following
                                                                        -
changes:
    1. That the law be made applicable to the judges of the Court
of Claims, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the
Customs Court as well as to circuit and district judges.
    2. That the amendment be added to § 372 of Title 28, United
States Code, instead of to § 371 and thus be made applicable to
 all judges who become permanently disabled and eligible to retire
 on that account without regard to their age or length of service.
    3. That a certificate of the disability of the judge should be
 required to be executed by an appropriate representative of the
 judiciary before the President could make another appointment.
 This certificate would be made by a majority of the members of
 the Judicial Council of his circuit in the case of a circuit or dis­
 trict judge, or by the Chief Justice of the United States in the
 case of the chief judge of the Court of Claims, Court of Customs
 and Patent Appeals or Customs Court, or by the chief judge of
 his court in the case of a judge of the Court of Claims, Court of
                                  5

Customs and Patent Appeals or Customs Court. It would still
be for the President to find whether or not the judge concerned
was unable on account of his disability to discharge all the duties
of his office and whether the appointment of an additional judge
was necessary for the efficient dispatch of business.
             SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS

  Judge Biggs, chairman of the Committee on Supporting Per­
sonnel, submitted a report on behalf of the Committee:
          SALARIES OF NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS

   The Committee had reexamined the salaries of national park
commissioners pursuant to the reference made by the Conference
at the September, 1953, session (Rept. p. 8). The Committee
conferred with representatives of the National Park Service, a,nd
examined data furnished by the Administrative Office obtained
from questionnaires answered by the commissioners. I t consid­
ered the volume of work handled by the commissioners in the var­
ious parks, their opportunities if any for outside employment, the
amount of rent paid by those commissioners who reside in quarters
furnished by the Park Service, salaries paid to officers of the Park
Service within the National Parks such as chief rangers and the
fact that the commissioners have not shared in the benefits of pay
increase legislation applying to Government employees generally
which has been enacted since the salaries of the commissioners
were last fixed in 1949. The Committee was of the opinion that
the three classifications into which the commissioners were divided
jn 1949 now should be changed due to changed conditions such
as slackening of case load and other pertinent circumstances.
   The Committee accordingly recommended the following sal­
aries for the National Park commissioners:
               CLASS   A-$5,OOO
          Rocky Mountain 

          Sequoia and Kings Canyon

   The recommendation of the Committee was approved by the
Conference. Section 634 of Title 28, United States Code, pro­
vides: "Each national park commissioner shall receive an annual
salary to he fixed by the district court with the approval of the
Judicial Conference of the United States * * *". The Confer­
ence directed that the district courts concerned be informed of
its action and requested to fix salaries for the park commissioners
within the maximum limits approved by it.

   PROVISION FOR FIRST-AID SERVICE IN CERTAIN COURTHOUSES

   The Administrative Office informed the Committee that health
centers and first-aid stations are being operated by Government
agencies for Government employees in some cities, and proposals
                                                                       ­
are pending for the establishment of additional facilities in other
cities. The courts have been invited to participate in these ar­
rangements on a reimbursable basis in some instances. Recently
Chief Judge John P. Barnes of the Northern District of Illinois
on behalf of his court has requested that the Administrative Office
make arrangements for the court personnel to utilize the facilities
of a first-aid station proposed for the building in which the court
is housed in Chicago.
   Two years ago the Conference approved a recommendation of
the Committee in relation to a similar program then proposed for
a new court bui1ding at Nashville, Tenn., to the effect that the
General Services Administration be informed that "the Judiciary
is not prepared at the present time to join in the program at Nash­
ville, but desires to give the matter further consideration" (Rept.,
March 1952 sess., p. 18, 19). However, first-aid stations are pres­
ently in operation, financed jointly by court and Department of
                                            7

      Justice appropriations in the courthouses in New York and Wash­
      ington, and are found to be serving a useful purpose.
        The Director of the Administrative Office recommended that he
      be authorized to participate in the establishment of health centers
      and first-aid stations where the local courts concerned desire to
      participate if the maximum per capita cost will not exceed a rea­
      sonable amount, and that additional funds for this purpose be
      included in the budget estimates to the extent necessary. The
      Committee approved this recommendation, and after discussion
      the Conference concurred.
         PROVISION FOR THE OFFICES        01~   THE DISTRICT COURT FOR 'l'HE
                               DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

         At the September session, 1953, of the Conference Chief Judge
      Laws submitted a written request for additional provisions for
      supporting personnel for the District of Columbia and asked that
      it be referred to the Committee on Supporting Personnel, which
      was done CRept. p. 9). The Committee considered the request at
      a meeting held in Washington on March 23 and 24, at which Judge
--    Laws, and also Judge Walter M. Bastian and Judge Matthew F.
___   McGuire, were heard. Also there appeared before the Committee
      officers of the court and two members of the Bar Association of the
      District of Columbia in support of the requests.
         The requests for additional personnel are summarized as
      follows:
         Clerk's office______________________________________<_<_______________   10
         Assignment CommIssioner's office__________________________________        1

         Office of the Administrative Assistant to Chief Judge Laws_________       1

               Total______________________________________________________        22

        At the conclusion of its consideration of the requests, a majority
      of the Committee adopted the following resolution:
             Resolved, That the Committee recommends to the Judicial
           Conference that the request of Chief Judge Laws for 22 addi­
           tional employees in the District Court for the District of
           Columbia be granted at salaries based on existing classification
           schedules heretofore approved by the Conference.
        This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
                                 8


  The Commit.tee also adopted the following resolution:
      Resolved, That the Committee recommends to the Judicial
    Conference of the United States that the Director of the Ad­
                                                                       -
    ministrative Office of the United States Court be instructed
    to survey the Office of the Register of Wills of the District
   of Columbia and reclassify the personnel of that office so as
    to bring them into line with the classifications heretofore ap­
    proved by the Judicial Conference for the personnel of the
    clerk~s offices of the district courts generally.

   This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
  With regard to other reclassifications requested by Chief Judge
Laws, a majority of the Committee adopted the following reso­
lution:
        Resolved, That the Committee does not recommend to the
     Conference the approval of the reclassifications requested by
     Chief Judge Laws, except for the reclassification of the Office
     of the Register of Wills which the Committee has recom­
     mended.
   After consideration, this recommendation was also approved by
the Conference.
   The Committee recommended and the Conference agreed that
                                                                       -
the Administrative Assistant to Chief Judge Laws, who is pres­
ently unclassified, be classified in grade OS-14, so as to make him
eligible hereafter for within-grade promotions.
   Chief Judge Stephens submitted the following request for addi­
tional personnel for the Court of Appeals for the District of Co­
lumbia Circuit which at his suggestion was referred to the Com­
mittee on Supporting Personnel:
        I hereby request the Judicial Conference of the United
     States to approve the request of the Clerk of the United States
     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for au­
     thority to appoint three additional Clerks in his Office. Jus­
     tification for such additional employees has been presented to
     the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
     Courts.
        On behalf of the Court of Appeals for the District of Co­
     lumbia Circuit I also hereby request the Judicial Conference
     to approve a request for authority to establish a stenographic
                                                              9

        pool of three stenographers in the Office of the Clerk of the
        United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
        Circuit, such pool to be available for the use of the Circuit
        Judges to assist them in their judicial work when their sec­
        retaries are engaged in other work and when their secretaries
        may be absent on account of illness or otherwise.

                                 BANKRUPrCY ADMINISTRATION

  Judge Phillips, Chairman of the Bankruptcy Committee, sub­
mitted for consideration by the Conference, the report of the Bank­
ruptcy Division of the Administrative Office, approved by the
Director on March 24, 1954. He also presented the report and
recommendations of the Bankruptcy Committee relating to cer­
tain changes in salaries and arrangements for referees.
  The Conference approved the report of the Committee, and in
accordance with the report made the changes in salaries and ar­
rangements for referees as shown in the following table, the in­
creases in salary to be effective July 1, 1954, subject to the
procurement of the necessary funds in the appropriation for 1955:

                   CHANGES IN ARRANGEMENTS

  In accordance with a change made by statute in the areas of
the Eastern and Western Districts of Michigan, Lansing, Mich.,
was discontinued as a place of holding court for the referees in
the Eastern District at Detroit and added as a place of holding
court for the referee in the Western District at Grand Rapids.

ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR 1955 FOR THE REFEREES' SALARIES
                          AND EXPENSES

   The Bankruptcy Committee recommended and the Conference
approved an increase of $103,500 over the amount originally ap­
proved by the Judicial Conference for the appropriation for 1955
for referees' salaries. Of this amount $18,500 is for the purpose
of making effective on July 1, 1954, the salary increases authorized
at the present meeting of the Judicial Conference. The balance
of $85,000 is to provide for additional referee service as needed
in 1955 to handle the increase ill bankruptcy work.
   The Conference also approved an increase of $50,000 over the
amount previously approved for referees' expenses for 1955. This       ~
is to provide as needed, additional clerical service to handle the
increased volume of work and for other expenses of the referees.
   The Conference authorized the Director to seek these additional
funds in the appropriations for Referees' Salaries and Expenses
for 1955.

REPORT CONCERNING CERTAIN PENDING LEQISLATION REFERRED TO
                  THE BANKRUPTCY COMMITTEE

  Chief Judge Phillips submitted to the Conference a written re­
port dated April 14, 1954, reciting that pursuant to the following
resolution adopted by the Conference in September 1953:
        Resolved, That the Bankruptcy Committee be authorized
     to study the subject of receivers and trustees and their com­
     pensation including S. 2344, S. 2560, S. 2561, S. 2562, S. 2563
     and H. R. 4400, 83d Congress, and report to the Conference.
he appointed a subcommittee of the Bankruptcy Committee to
study and report to the full Committee their findings and conclu­
sions thereon. The subcommittee submitted its report dated Feb­
ruary 5, 1954, which was transmitted by the chairman of the full
                                         11 

        Committee to the members of the Committee, all of whom ex­
        pressed their approval.
           Inasmuch as the report involves matters affecting the district
        judges and the district courts, Judge Phillips recommended that
        a copy of the Bankruptcy Committee report dated April 14, 1954,
        and of the report of the subcommittee dated February 5, 1954, be
        circulated among the circuit and district judges; that the judges
        and the judicial conferences and judicial councils of the circuits
        be requested to express their views upon the reports; that all views
        expressed be communicated to the Committee on Bankruptcy
        Administration of the Conference for its consideration; and that
        the Bankruptcy Committee make further report to the Conference
        at its next regular meeting. The Conference approved the rec­
        ommendation.
           The Chairman of the Bankruptcy Committee reported to the
        Conference that the annual bankruptcy statistics prepared by the
        Administrative Office disclose that in certain districts, the costs
        of administration recurrently exceed the national average. The
        Administrative Office was directed to bring these situations to the
        attention of the Chief Judges of the circuits concerned for appro­
.,.",   priate action.
        VACANCY IN REFEREE POSITION AT OXFORD, MISS., AUTHORITY TO
                            MAKE NEW APPOINTMENT

           Judge Hutcheson reported to the Conference that a vacancy
        exists in the office of the referee in bankruptcy for the Northern
        District of Mississippi, and that the Director, United States Dis­
        trict Judge Cox and the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit had
        recommended the filling of the vacancy pursuant to section 43b
        of the Bankruptcy Act.
           The Conference authorized a new appointment to be made ona
        part-time basis at a salary of $1,200 a year for a term of 6 years,
        the regular place of office of the referee to be at Oxford and the
        territory to embrace the Northern District of Mississippi.
                         THE COURT REPOR'rING SYSTEM

        APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TO TRANSCRIPT EARNINGS

         The Director submitted to the Conference the question as to
y       whether earnings of reporters from their fees for official transcript
                                 12

should be regarded as earnings of self employed persons for the        ""I!"
purposes of the Social Security Act, and indicated that he so          ""'­
construed the statute. It was explained that as far as their salar­
ies which are paid by the Government are concerned, the reporters
are under the Civil Service Retirement Act. This is not true, how­
ever, with respect to their earnings from transcripts which are paid
to them directly by the parties to the cases who order the tran­
scripts, both private litigants and the Government, and do not
pass through the Administrative Office. It was the sense of the
Conference that the earnings of the reporters from their fees for
official transcript are covered by the Social Security Act.
                   RATES FOR DAILY TRANSCRIPT

   At the September 1953, session, the Conference declined to
approve any increase in transcript rates, but as stated on page 16
of the Conference report "approved a provision in reference to the
procedure for determining the charges for daily or other expedited
transcript, that such charges shall be fixed by agreement of the
parties which in each individual case shall be submitted to the
trial judge and shall require his express approval, and that in        -.
lengthy cases the reporter's charges shall be fixed after the con.:.
clusion of the case, with progress payments to the reporter or
deposits as ordered by the court." The Conference was informed
that some reporters have interpreted the action of the Conference
to permit the fixing of charges in the manner prescribed above the
maximum limits of 90 cents per page for the original and 30 cents
per page for copy prescribed by the Conference in 1948 (page 26
of the September 1948 report).
   The Conference reaffirmed its action taken at the September
1953, session with regard to this matter and expressly declared that
its action then was intended to prescribe how charges for daily
transcripts should be determined in individual cases within the
maximum limits of 90 cents per page for the original and 30 cents
per page for copies, and was not intended to authorize the fixing
of rates above those limits.

 INCLUSION OF COURT REPORTERS IN PAY INCREASE LEGISLATION

  The Conference approved the recommendation of the Director
that the court reporters be included in pending legislation to in­
                                                      13 

     crease the salaries of Government employees so that the reporters
     may receive as additions t{) their salaries as presently fixed by
     the Judicial Conference, the benefit of any such increases which
     may be authorized by the Congress.
                   APPOINTMEN'l' OF ADDITIONAL COURT REPORTERS

           Section 753 of Title 28, United States Code, authorizes the
         Judicial Conference to determine the number of court reporters
         to be appointed for service in the district courts and to fix their
         salaries. I t has been the policy of the Conference since the be­
         ginning of the court reporter system in 1944 to authorize the ap­
         pointment for each court of a number of reporters equal to the
         number of active judges of the court. In keeping with this policy
         the Conference, after consideration of a recommendation of the
         Director, authorized the appointment of 27 additional court re­
         porters corresponding with the number of additional district
         judgeships created by Public Law 294, in the districts and at
         salaries before and after the end of the present fiscal year (contin­
         gent in the latter case upon favorable action by the Congress upon
         the pending estimate for increase in the annual appropriation for

                 SUPPLEMENTAL ApPROPRIATIONS

   The Director submitted supplemental estimates of appropria­
tions for the fiscal year 1955 made necessary by the enactment of
Public Law 294 authorizing the appointment of additional judges,
for salaries of judges, salaries of supporting personnel for the new
judges, travel and miscellaneous expenses, in the total amount of
$1,450,950. The estimates were approved.

               VOTE OF THE CONFERENCE BY MAIL

  The Conference adopted the following resolution:
       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Conference: That, ex­
    cept in cases of emergency or in matters of minor importance
    such as the filling of vacancies in the offices of referees under
    the Bankruptcy Act, action of the Conference should be taken
    only in meetings regularly called and held. If the Chief Jus­
    tice shall be of opinion that because of an emergency the public
    interest so requires, a mail vote .of the members of the Con­
    ference may be taken, which shall be announced as action of
    the Conference taken by maiL                                        -­
POWER TO   FIX   SALARIES OF 	SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF SPECIAL
                              COURTS

  A question having been raised as to the power to fix salaries of
the supporting personnel of the Court of Customs and Patent Ap­
peals, not otherwise fixed by law, it was the sense of the Conference
that the power to fix such salaries and also the salaries of the sup­
porting personnel of the Court of Claims and the Customs Court
resides in the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts by virtue of the provisions of Title 28, United States
Code, sections 604 (a) (5) and 610.

BILLS RELATING TO THE COURT OF CUSTOMS AND PATENT APPEALS
                    AND THE CUSTOMS CoURT

  Chief Judge Garrett and Judge Johnson of the Court of Cus­
toms and Patent Appeals and Chief Judge Oliver and Judge Ek­
wall of the Customs Court, discussed with the Conference bills
pending in the Congress relating to their courts (S. 3131 and H. R.
7864 concerning the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals; S.
                                  15 

2975 and H. R. 6919 concerning the Customs Court). These bills
would declare the courts to be established under Article III of the
Constitution and contain provisions for the temporary assignment
of their judges to serve in the other courts and of other judges
to serve in those courts.
   The bills were referred to the Committee on Revision of the
Laws to study and report to the next session of the Conference.

            JUDICIAL REVIEW OF DEPORTATION ORDERS

   Solicitor General Sobeloff, accompanied by Mr. Stern and Mr.
Ginnane, discussed with the Conference a method of judicial re­
view of deportation orders proposed by the Department of Jus­
tice as a substitute for habeas corpus which is available to a;n
alien only after he has been taken into custody for deportation.
   The Conference approved the proposed bill which would permit
an alien who is not in custody and against whom a final order
of deportation has been made to obtain a judicial review of the
order by filing a petition in the district court for the district within
which the administrative proceedings to be reviewed were
conducted.
                       CoNDEMNA'l'ION CASES

   During the last Congress a bill was introduced but failed of en­
actment which in effect would have amended Rule 71A (h) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure so as to require a jury trial
of the issue of just compensation on demand of either party in
condemnation proceedings in the district courts. After the ap­
pointment of a committee and careful consideration of its report,
the Conference at the March 1952, session (Rept. p. 7-8) was of
the opinion that the proposed legislation ought not to be enacted.
This view was reaffirmed at the September 1952, session (Rept.
p.15).
  In the present Congress, S. 30, entitled "An Act to provide
for jury trials in condemnation proceedings in United States district
courts" is pending in the House of Representatives after havjng
passed the Senate. The bill is similar to the proposed legislation
previously disapproved by the Conference except that the Senate
amended the bill so as to limit to the defendant the right to de­
mand a jury trial. The Conference is of the opinion that the
present procedure in condemnation cases prescribed by Rule 71A
                                16 

(h) should be permitted to continue and disapproved the pending
bill.
          CONFERENCE ON ADMINISTRA'rIVE PROCEDURE

   Judge Prettyman reported on the progress of the Conference on
Administrative Procedure of which he is Chairman. A First Re­
port of the Conference has been printed and approximately 1,500
copies distributed to governmental agencies, bar associations, and
interested individuals and groups for comments and suggestions.
A further meeting of the Conference is scheduled to be held on
June 7-8 after which the Conference hopes to be able to make firm
recommendations to the President, to the Judicial Conference, and
to the agencies.
RULE ADOPTED BY THE COURT OF ApPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
  FOR REVIEW OR ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE
 . AGENCIES

   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit submitted to the Con­
ference for approval pursuant to the provisions of the Act of De­
cember 29, 1950 (64 Stat. 1129; 5 U. S. C. 1041) an order dated
January 14, 1954, amending rules 38 and 39 of the Rules of the        ­
court relating to the review and enforcement of orders of admin­
istrative agencies. The Conference approved the amendments to
the Rules as submitted.
  DISPOSITION OF OLD RECORDS OF COURTS OF APPEALS NOT OF
                      PERMANENT VALUE

  A schedule relating to the disposal of noncurrent records of the
courts of appeals which had been prepared by the National Ar­
chives was presented to the Conference by the Administrative
Office with the recommendation that leave be given to consent
that the schedule be submitted to Congress by the Archivist pur­
suant to the provisions of Title 44, United States Code, sections
366-380. The appointment of a committee to consider the matter
was authorized, and the following committee was appointed by
the Chief Justice: Chief Judge Calvert Magruder, Chairman, Cir­
cuit Judge Jerome Frank and Circuit Judge Gerald McLaughlin.

        PROPOSAL TO INCLUDE ApPROPRIATIONS FOR SPECIAL MASTERS IN 

                             BUDGETS OF THE COURTS 


           The Conference was informed that the Department of Justice
        had suggested that consideration be given to the inclusion in the
        budget estimates of the Courts of sums to pay the fees of masters
        appointed under Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
        commissioners appointed in land condemnation cases under Rule
        71A (h) and other finders of facts, and desired the Judicial Con­
        ference to consider the matter. The Conference disapproved the
        proposal.
                               COST OF JURY SYSTEM

          The Administrative Office has continued to collect statistics on
        jury costs and submitted a report accompanied by summaries of
        reports received for the first half of the fiscal year 1954 from
        85 of the 86 district courts having purely Federal jurisdiction.
           The report disclosed that the number of jury trials, the total jury
        costs and the average cost of each trial have increased steadily since
        1950. Total jury costs during the fiscal year 1953 amounted to
,.,;'
        $3,166,000 and at the present time these costs constitute about
        one-ninth of the total budget for the courts.
          The Conference authorized the Administrative Office to circu­
        late the report among the circuit and district judges.
                     COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS

          Judge Maris, Chairman, submitted the report of the Committee
        on Revision of the Laws:
           RECORD ON REVIEW OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

          The Committee had circulated among the circuit judges and
        agencies concerned a preliminary draft bill to authorize an ab­
        breviated record on the review of agency orders pursuant to
        authority granted by the Conference to do so at the September,
        1953, session (Rept. p. 25), A revised bill was submitted to the
        Conference which would add to Title 28, United States Code,
        a new section 2112, entitled "Record on review and enforcement
                                  18 


of agency orders." The courts of appeals would be given power
to adopt, with the approval of the Judicial Conference, rules pre­
scribing the time and manner of filing and the contents of the
record in all such proceedings, unless the applicable statute makes
specific provision on the subject. Specific statutory provisions
would be unnecessary hereafter, however, if the proposed bill is
enacted. If proceedings have been instituted in two or more
courts with respect to the same order the agency would file the
record in that court which would be most convenient to the parties
and the other courts would then transfer their proceedings to that
court. The record would be abbreviated by the inclusion only of
such material as the rules of court required or as the parties, in­
cluding parties permitted to intervene by the court, stipulated or
as the court designated by order. In appropriate cases it could be
stipulated that no record at all be filed. Provision is made that
additional portions of the record might be ordered by the court
to be filed if found to be needed. It had been represented to the
committee that in some cases it would be more costly in time and
money to attempt to abbreviate the record than to send it all to
the court. Accordingly the Committee had included in the bill
a provision giving the agencies the right to file the entire record
in those courts only which, in view of their use of the appendix
system or modified printed record system, do not require the en­
tire record to be printed.
   At the option of the agency original papers in lieu of certified
copies would be permitted to be transmitted to the reviewing court.
The Committee considered it desirable to provide that the court
should have jurisdiction upon the filing of the petition for review
instead of upon the filing of the transcript of record as at present
in some cases. However, since some agencies have power to
modify or set aside an order after the filing of a petition for re­
 view and until the time of filing the record, which they wish to
retain, the Committee has proposed to amend these statutes so
 that jurisdiction is acquired upon the filing of a petition for review
 but is not exclusive until the filing of the record. Perfecting
 amendments of various statutes had also been included in the bill.
   After consideration of the Committee's report, the Conference
 approved the draft of the proposed bill for recommendation to
Congress for enactment.
                                 19
              REVISION OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE

   The Committee informed the Conference that it had recom­
mended to the Senate Committee on Finance that H. R. 8300,
a bill revising the internal revenue laws, be amended so as to enact
its subject matter as Title 26 of the United States Code. As it
passed the House of Representatives the bill did not enact that
title into positive law.
   The Committee also informed the Conference that it had sug­
gested perfecting amendments to H. R. 8300 with respect to the
Tax Court, under which the judge who is to preside in a division
of more than one judge would be designated as the "presiding
judge" rather than as the "chief" of the division, the sessions of
the court would be described as "sessions" instead of "meetings,"
the time for instituting proceedings to review Tax Court decisions
would be prescribed as "90 days" and "120 days" instead of the
less precise "3 months" and "4 months," and such review proceed­
ings would be begun by "notice of appeal" as in the case of the
review of tax decisions of the district courts instead of by "petition
for review."
   The Conference approved this part of the report and the actions
taken by the Committee.
              MATTERS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE

   The Conference referred the following matters to the Committee
on Revision of the Laws for consideration and report:
   1. A recommendation by the Judicial Council of the District of
Columbia Circuit that section 646 (d) of Title 49 of the United
States Code relating to Air Carriers, and the Hobbs Act approved
December 29,1950 (64 Stat. 1129, 1131) be amended so as to elim­
inate the requirement that 5 days notice be given before interlocu­
tory relief may be granted.
   2. A proposal made by Prof. George B. Fraser of the College of
Law of the University of Oklahoma for amendment of section 1441
of Title 28, United States Code, pertaining to the removal of cases
from State courts.
   3. A proposal that retired judges, since they are not required
to live within the circuits in which they were appointed, may be
assigned for service which they are willing to undertake outside
                                 20 

of such circuits without the consent of the Chief Judge thereof as      /-. 

is required with respect to active judges.                               ./ 

RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF DECISIONS OF THE        TAX COURT
  H. R. 1067, entitled "An Act to authorize the Supreme Court
of the United States to make and publish rules for procedure on
review of decisions of the Tax Court of the United States" has
passed the House of Representatives and with amendments has also
passed the Senate. No agreement has been reached between the
two houses with respect to the Senate amendments.
  The Conference expressed its opposition to the enactment of
this proposed legislation for the reasons set forth in the letter
dated April 28, 1953, addressed to the Chairman of the House Ju­
diciary Committee by the late Chief Justice Vinson which is printed
on page 4 of the Committee Report on the bill (H. Rept. No.
1262, 83d Cong., 2d sess.).
      QUARTERS OF THE CoURTS AND RELATED FACILITIES

   Commissioner Reynolds of the Public Buildings Service, accom­
panied by Mr. Hunter and Mr. Strobel of his office, discussed with
the Conference the program of the Public Buildings Service re­
lating to the furnishing of quarters for the 30 additional judges
                                                                        -

authorized by Public Law 294 and the air-conditioning of Federal
buildings containing court quarters. The requirement of space for
the new judges is obvious, and members of the Conference again
discussed the urgent need for air-conditioning of court quarters
both for judges and supporting personnel at many places. The
constantly increasing business of the courts requires their operation
in the summer. Under these circumstances, not only is air-con­
ditioning requisite for the reasonable comfort and efficiency of the
judges and other court personnel, but the proceedings of the courts
in many locations cannot be conducted efficiently without it.
   The Conference heartily endorsed the program for furnishing
additional space for quarters for the new judges already appointed
and to be appointed under the new Act, and also for air-condition­
ing buildings containing court quarters submitted by Commissioner
Reynolds.
   The Conference resolved that it is opposed to the proposed sub­
stitution of cleaning of public buildings by contract instead of
                                     21 

     by Government personnel employed for that purpose as far as court
     quarters are concerned for the reason that it does not consider it
     a wise policy for contract employees over whom there could be no
     effective supervision with respect to character, loyalty and trust­
     worthiness to have the freedom of access to court quarters which
     would be requisite for the work of cleaning.
     EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION FOR STATES TO ENTER INTO COM­
                  PACTS FOR THE PREVENTION OF CruME

       The Director informed the Conference that an expression of
     views had been requested by the House Judiciary Committee with
     regard to H. R. 5699 pending before that Committee. This bill
     would extend the coverage of section 111 of Title 4, United States
     Code, granting the consent of Congress to States to enter into
     compacts relating to the enforcement of criminal laws by includ­
     ing the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico within the definition of the
     term "States" for the purposes of the section. The Conference was
     further informed that it had been proposed that the bill be amended
     so as to include not only Puerto Rico, but also Alaska, Hawaii, the
     Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia within the definition
<,   of "States." The Conference approved the bill as it is proposed
     to be amended.
              THE QUALIFICATIONS OF PROBATION OFFICERS

        The Conference makes note of the added responsibilities that
     will come to the Federal probation officers in connection with the
     treatment of youth offenders under the Federal Youth Correc­
     tions Act. These will make it more necessary than ever before
     that the officers should be suitably qualified by education and ex­
     perience for their work. The Conference therefore renews its
     recommendation of the standards of qualifications originally rec­
     ommended by it in 1942 (pp. 9-10 of the September 1942 Report)
     and here repeated for convenience as follows:
        (1) Exemplary character.
        (2) Good health and vigor.
        (3) An age at the time of appointment within the range of 24 to
     45 years inclusive.
