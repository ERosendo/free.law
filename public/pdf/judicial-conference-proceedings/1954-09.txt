                                                   Chief Judge F. Ryan Duffy. 

                                                   Chief Judge Archibald K. Gardner. 

                                                   Chief Judge William Denman.
                                                   Chief Judge Ode L. Phillips.

   The Conference welcomed the new Chief Judge for the Second
 Circuit, Honorable Charles E. Clark, succeeding Chief Judge
 Harrie B. Chase, retired; and welcomed also the new Chief Judge
 for the Seventh Circuit, Honorable Francis Ryan Duffy, succeed­
 ing Honorable J. Earl Major, who has relinquished the office of
 Chief Judge for the Seventh Circuit pursuant to 28 U. S. C.
 § 45 (c), In this connection the Conference adopted the follow­
 ing resolution:
        Whereas, Honorable Harrie Brigham Chase retired on
      September 1, 1954, from regular active service as a Circuit
      Judge of the Second Circuit, after 35 years of distinguished
      judicial service on the State courts of Vermont and on the
      Federal bench, culminating in his accession to the office of
      Chief Judge of the Second Circuit on July 1, 1953, and
         Whereas, it has resulted from Chief Judge Chase's service
      of less than one year as a member of this body that the mem­
      bers of the Conference are all genuinely sorry for the brevity
      of our official association with him, and
                                            (1)
                                  2


         Whereas, Honorable J. Earl Major, after 6 years of service      ~
      on this body has withdrawn from the Judicial Conference by         -­
      virtue of his relinquishment of the office of Chief Judge of
      the Seventh Circuit on September I, 1954, and
         Whereas, this Conference will miss the practical, earthy
      counsel, the unfailing good nature, the sly but never malicious
      wit, of Chief Judge Major: Now, Therefore, be it
         Resolved,That we express in this formal way our apprecia­
      tion to Chief Judge Chase and to Chief Judge Major for their
      services as members of this Conference, our assurance to them
      of our affectionate regard, our regret for their departure from
      our midst, and our every good wish for them in the years ahead.
   The Conference sadly took note of the death on September 8,
1954, in the 88th year of his life, of the Honorable Curtis D. Wilbur,
who for many years was a valued member of this body, until his
retirement on May 10, 1945. The resolution of this Conference
adopted upon the occasion of Judge Wilbur's retirement is found

     sion of Procedural Studies and Statistics on the state of the busi­
     ness of the courts. The Conference approved the immediate
     release of the report for publication and authorized the Director
     to revise and supplement it in the final printed edition to be

                        BUSINESS OF THE COURTS

        State of the dockets of the Federal courts-Courts of appeals.­
     Cases filed in the courts of appeals have shown a steady but grad­
     ual increase since 1950. During the fiscal year 1954 the total
     number commenced increased 8 percent over the previous year
     to 3,481. Terminated cases were 3,192 and the number pending
     at the end of the year went up by 289 to 2,134. The largest num~
     ber of cases, 517, was begun in the Court of Appeals of the Ninth
     Circuit, which was able to dispose of only 363, leaving 584 cases
     pending at the end of the year. As a result the median time from
     filing of the complete record to final disposition of cases heard or
     submitted in that circuit increased to 13.6 months compared with
     the national median of 7.1 months. The First, Second, Third,
     Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits all had a median time of dis­
     position of less than 7 months. Public Law 294 of the 83d Con­
     gress, approved February 10, 1954, provided for 2 additional
     judgeships for the Ninth Circuit and 1 for the Fifth.
        Petitions to the Supreme Court for review on certiorari to the
     United States Courts of Appeals were 592 in 1954, compared with
          322298-l111-2

       603 in 1953. The percentage of the number granted to the total
       number acted on was 12.4 percent, compared with 14.3 percent
       during the previous year.            /
          District courts.-The serious condition of the civil dockets in
                                                                                  -
       many district courts is indicated by the increase in the median time
       required from filing to disposition of civil cases tried in 86 districts
       having only Federal jurisdiction, from 12.4 months in the fiscal
       year 1953 to 13.5 months in 1954. This has been accompanied by
       a further rise in the number of pending civil cases despite a decrease
       in the number of cases commenced.
          There was a desJ;ne of 7 percent in the number of civil cases filed
       in the district courts during the fiscal year 1954 as compared with
       the previous year. This resulted from special circumstances in­
       cluding the expiration of rent controls and other restrictions pro­
       vided in the Defense Production Act of 1950, a' sharp decline in
       declaratory judgment actions in reference to citizenship and a de­
       crease in National City Bank note cases in Puerto Rico. Civil
       cases commenced were 59,461 compared with 57,903 cases closed
       leaving 68,431 pending at the end of the year. Private cases were
       slightly fewer than last year but actions based on diversity of cit­
       izenship continued to increase in both tort and contract categories
       in response to the definite trend which has been in effect for 10
                                                                                  o
       years.
          By Public Law 294 Congress created 27 new district judgeships
       and most of these positions have now been filled. Even with this
       addition to the judicial force, the number of judgeships in the
       district courts has increased by only 27 percent since 1941, com­
1/ 	   pared with a 55 percent increase in all civil cases commenced
       annually and an 80 percent increase in private civil cases, which
       take much the largest part of the judges' time. The inability of
       the courts to keep up with incoming business has resulted in long
       delays in reaching trial in some metropolitan districts with the
       worst condition in the Southern District of N ew York, where, on
       June 30,1954, there were 10,989 civil cases pending of which 6,213
       were on the trial calendar, and where litigants in jury personal
       injury cases were being required to wait 44 months to get a trial
       after the case was calendared. In this district, in the Eastern Dis­
       trict of Pennsylvania and in the Northern District of Ohio, in spite
        of extreme docket congestion, Congress failed to provide the num,,:,
       ber of judgeships previously recommended by the Judicial Con­
                                           5


          ference. Detailed information concerning them and a number of
          other districts which have fallen behind in the disposition of cases
          is contained in the Director's report.
             Although there was a 12 percent increase in criminal cases in
          1954, this was almost entirely the result of an increase in informa­
          tions charging immigration law violations in the districts on the
          Mexican border. The total number of criminal cases filed was
          41,808 and the number terminated, other than by transfers, was
          41,258, leaving 10,100 cases pending at the end of the year of which
          between a fifth and a sixth could not be disposed of because of
          fugitive defendants. Generally speaking, criminal cases have pri­
          ority and the criminal dockets are in good condition except as to
          some cases where long trials are in prospect. The Director's report
          lists 13 Communist cases brought under the Smith Act since 1949,
          of which 9 had been completed by the end of the year, requiring
          a total of 845 trial days.
             An increase of almost one third in bankruptcy cases commenced
          brought the total in 1954 to 53,136. Terminations were 43,494
          and the pending load increased to 48,428, the highest figure in 12
          years. There were 18 districts with over ·100 cases filed in 1954,
          which showed increases of more than 50 percent in the number of
          cases commenced as compared with 1953.
             Cases and motions under advisement.-At the end of the fiscal
          year 1954, of 222 district judges reporting, 147 reported no cases
          held under advisement over 30 days. The number of cases and
          motions held over 60 days was 120, compared with 107 at the end
          of the third quarter. The Administrative Office submitted a re­
          port to the Conference listing, by judge, 31 cases and motions
          which had been held under advisement more than 6 months on
          September 10, 1954. Where necessary, these will be brought
          to the attention of the circuit council by the chief judge of the
          circuit.
                      ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS RECOMMENDED

             The Conference reaffirmed its previous recommendations (Cf.
          Rep. April 15, 16, 1954 pp. 2-3) with respect to the creation of
          additional district judgeships not included in Public Law 294,
          83d Congress, approved February 10, 1954, except that the ere a­
 ".....   tion of 3 additional permanent judgeships for the Southern Dis­
\....     trict of New York was recommended instead of 3 additional judge­
                                      6

ships with a proviso that the first 2 vacancies occurring in that
district should not be filled as heretofore recommended.
   The Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit having rescinded
its recommendation that the NinthCircuit be divided and a new
Eleventh Circuit constituted, the Conference rescinded its rec­
ommendation in this respect adopted at the special session held
in April 1954 (Cf. Rep. p. 3), and holds the matter in abeyance
pending further action by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Cir­
cuit. The Conference recommended the creation of 3 additional
judgeships (2 permanent and 1 temporary) for that circuit.
   After reviewing the needs of the courts, the Conference also
recommended the creation of the following additional judge­
i>hip:
   One additional district judgeship for the Eastern, :Middle and Western Dis­
tricts of N0rttJJ)arolina.

tions with respect to judgeships follows:

     ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEPARATE DOMESTIC RELATIONS CoURT FOR
                            THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

       The Conference reaffirmed the following resolution adopted at
     the September 1953 session (Cf. Rep. p. 28) :
             "Resolved, that the Judicial Conference of the United States
          reaffirms its approval of the creation in the District of
          Columbia of a separate court for the handling of domestic
          relations cases and matters pertaining to them; and recom­
          mends that legislation providing for this separation be
          promptly enacted by the Congress of the United States.
             liThe Conference represents to Congress that unless this
          separation of business as recommended is accomplished at an
          early date, three additional judges will be required and should
          be authorized by Congress for the United States District Court
          for the District of Columbia."
     ApPOINTMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL JUDGE! WHEN A DISABLED JUDGE
                                   F AII"S   TO RETIRE

        The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation made at the April
     1954 special session (Cf. Rep. p. 3), relating to the appointment of
     an additional judge when a disabled judge fails to retire. Prior to
     its repeal by Public Law 294 of the 83d Congress, subsection (c) of
     § 371 of Title 28, United States Code, provided that whenever a
     circuit or district judge who was eligible to retire on account of
     age and length of service failed to do so and the President should
     find that he was unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of
     his office by reason of permanent mental or physical disability and
     that the appointment of an additional judge was necessary for the
     efficient dispatch of business, the President could make such an
     appointment by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
        The recommendation of the Conference is that the repealed la,,,
     be reenacted with the following changes:
       1. That the law be made applicable to the judges of the Court of Claims, the
     Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Customs Court, as well as to
     circuit and district judges.
       2. That the amendment be added to § 372 of Title 28, United States Code,
     instead of to § 371 and thus be made applicable to all judges who become perma­
     nently disabled and eligible to retire on that account without regard to their
     age or length of service.
       3. That a certificate of the disability of the judge should be required to be

-	   executed by an appropriate representative of the judiciary before the President
     could make another appOintment although it would still be for the PreSident
     to tind whether or not the judge concerned was unable on account of his dis­
     ability to discharge all the duties of his office and whether the appointment of
     an additional judge was necessary for the efDcient dispatch of business.

        ASSIGNMENT OF RETIRED JUDGES TO ACTIVE SERVICE

   In a report submitted by the Committee on Retirement of
Judges of which Judge Duffy is chairman, a recommendation was
made that there be established in the office of the Chief Justice a
register which would contain the names of all retired judges who
desire to be available for special judicial assignments. The regis­
ter would be known as the Roster of Senior Judges. Consent of
the chief judge or judicial council of the circuit from which a re­
tired judge would be designated would not be required. A draft
of a proposed bill accompanied the report.
   A cognate proposal that retired judges, because they are not
required to live within the circuits in which they were appointed,
may be assigned for service which they are willing to undertake
outside such circuits without the consent of the chief judge had
been referred to the Committee on Revision of the Laws under the
chairmanship of Judge Maris at the April 1954 session (Cf. Rep.
p. 19). That Committee also recommended the draft of a bill
which would accomplish the purpose by amending § 295 of Title
28, United States Code, so as to restrict to judges in active service
its requirement that consent of the chief judge or judicial council
of the circuit be obtained for a designation outside the circuit. A       o
request from the chief judge of the circuit to which the assignment
was to be made would continue to be required as at present. As a
substitute for a similar provision in the draft of bill proposed by the
Committee on Retirement of Judges to provide for a roster of
retired judges the Conference approved the draft of the bill recom­
mended by the Committee on Revision of the Laws.

 PROPOSED DESIGNATION OF RETIRED JUDGES AS "SENIOR JUDGES"

   The Committee on Retirement of Judges also submitted a pro­
posal that § 371 (b) of Title 28, United States Code, be amended
so as to designate a judge taking advantage of the retirement pro­
visions as "senior judge" instead of his being called a "retired
judge" as at present. It was pointed out that judicial retirement
is sometimes confused with "retirement" as the term is used with
reference to other Government service and private industry, al­
though it is essentially different in that retired judges can and fre­
quently do continue to render judicial service. The Committee
had learned that in some instances judges contemplating retire­
ment had hesitated to accept it because the term to them carried a
                                           9


    connotation of inability to carryon judicial duties. The Confer­

-   ence directed that the proposals in reference to a roster of retired
    judges and the designation of such judges as senior judges, with
    the substitute approved by the Conference to do away with the
    necessity for consent of the chief judge of the circuit in case of the
    assignment of a retired judge outside of the circuit, be circulated
    among the judges for an expression of views.
    ATrENDANCE OF RETIRED JUDGES AT JUDICIAL CONFERENCES OF THE
                             CIRCUITS

       A recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Cir­
    cuit that the statute be amended so as specifically to include re­
    tired judges among the judges to be summoned to attend the
    judicial conferences of the circuits was not acted on for the reason
    that the Conference is of the opinion that it is not necessary. The
    Conference takes the view that when retired judges are summoned
    to the circuit conferences they are performing official functions and
    are so entitled to reimbursement for their expenses of travel and
    subsistence.
                    SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS

      Judge Maris reported for the Committee on Supporting Per­
    sonnel of the Courts in the absence of Judge Biggs, the Chairman
    of the Committee. The report contained no recommendations
    requiring action by the Conference. The Conference was informed
    concerning the action taken by the district courts with respect to
    the salaries of national park commissioners pursuant to the author­
    ization made by the Conference at the April 1954 special session
    (Cf. Rep. p. 5).
      The Committee asked and was given leave to report at a later
    date with regard to the request submitted by Chief Judge Stephens
    at the April 1954 special session for additional personnel for the
    Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Cf. Rep.
    p.8).
      The Conference referred to the Committee for consideration and
    report the following resolutions adopted by the Judicial Confer­
    ence of the Ninth Circuit at its meeting held in July of 1954:
       (1) A resolution recommending that legislation be enacted concerning the
    retirement of secretaries of Federal judges similar to that enacted in relation
    to employees of the legislative branch by Public Law 303 of the present Congress,
    approved March 6, 1954.
                                       10 

  (2) A resolution to amend the present classification plan heretofore approved
by the Judicial Conference for secretaries and law clerks of judges and contained
in the annual appropriation acts so as to add to grades 08-4 to 08-8 inclusive,
which are presently open to secretaries of judges, grades 08-9, 08-10, 08-11,
and 08-12.
  A request by Judge Denman for review of the action of the
Administrative Office in declining to reclassify the positions of the
chief deputy clerk and a deputy clerk in the District of Nevada
with increases in salary was referred to the Committee.
  Also referred to the Committee was a proposal of the Adminis­
trative Assistant Attorney General, that the fees of bailiffs em­
ployed temporarily to assist criers in the district courts under
§ 755 of Title 28, United States Code, and the fees of witnesses
for indigent litigants when payable by the Government be pro­
vided for in the appropriations for the courts instead of those for
the Department of Justice as at present.
      AMENDMENT OF THE WITHIN-GRADE PROMOTIONAL PLAN

   In order to accord to employees of the courts in grades 11 to 15
treatment with respect to longevity increases similar to that
granted by the provisions of Public Law 763 of the 83d Congress
to employees in those grades under the Classification Act of 1949,
the within-grade promotional plan as revised by the Conference
at its November 1949 session (Cf. Rep. p. 3) was amended effective
as of September 13, 1954 as follow~: For the second paragraph
under the heading "2. The basis of promotions", substitute the
following:
       An additional step-increase (to be known as a longevity step­
    increase) beyond the maximum scheduled rate of the grade
    in which his position is placed will be granted to each officer
    or employee for each 3 years of continuous service completed
    by him at such maximum rate or at a rate in excess thereof
    authorized by this paragraph without increase in grade or
    rate of basic compensation except such change as may be
    prescribed by any provision of law of general application,
    subject to the following conditions:
       1. No officer or employee shall be entitled to a longevity
    step-increase while holding a position in any grade above
    grade 15 of the General Schedule as established by the Classi­
    fication Act of 1949 as amended.
       2. No officer or employee shall receive a longevity step­
    increase unless his current efficiency rating is good or better
    than good.
                                                                                    -
                                       11 

        3. No officer or employee shall receive more than 1 longevity
     step-increase for any 3 years of continuous service.            .
        4. Each longevity step-increase shall be equal to one step·
     increase of the grade in which the position of the officer or
     employee is placed except that the step-increase for grade 15
     shall be $200.
        5. Not more than three successive longevity step-increases
     may be granted to any officer or employee.
        6. The officer or employee shall have had in the aggregate,
     not less than 10 years of service in the position which he then
     occupies, or in positions of equivalent or higher class or grade:
        In the case of officers and employees in grades 11 to 15,
     inclusive, of the General Schedule who are receiving com­
     pensation at or above the maximum scheduled rates for their
     respective grade on the date immediately preceding the
     effective date of this amendatory provision, not to exceed
     3 years of service performed immediately preceding such effec­
     tive date, shall be counted toward longevity step-increases.
  For the purpose of conforming the references to the courts and
judges to the proper nomenclature paragraph 3 (d) of the pro­
motional plan as set forth in the Conference report referred to
was amended to read as follows:
   (d) The review of ratings.
  Every ofik-er or employee will be given. notice in writing by his rating officer
of his adjective rating. Any officer or employee, except one whose rating rests
in a judge without review, who desires to appeal his efficiency rating will be
given an opportunity to do so in writing, within 10 days from receipt of writ­
ten notice of the rating, in the case of courts of appeals to the chief judge of
the circuit. and in the case of district courts to the resident district judge if
there be only one, or the chief judge of the district court if there be more than
one. A hearing will then he held by the judge in the presence of the omcer
or employee and the rating omcer. Both the omcer or employee and the rating
omcer or either may be represented in the hearing by another person at the
option of both or either. The judge will determine the final emciency rating
to be assigned without further review.

                     BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

  Judge Phillips, chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy Ad­
ministration, reported that the Committee had met and considered
the recommendations contained in the report of the Bankruptcy
Division of the Administrative Office which was approved by the
Director on August 16, 1954, relating to certain changes in the
salaries of referees, and other arrangements.
  The report was submitted by the Director to the members of
the Judicial Conference and to the judicial councils and the dis­
      322293-55-3
                                                              .12 

ttict judges of the circuits and districts concerned, with the re-                                                              ~,
quest that the district judges advise the judicial councils of their                                                            """
respective circuits of their views in respect to the recommenda­
tions for their districts and that the chief judges of the circuits
in turn inform the Administrative Office of the views of the ju­
dicial councils of their circuits. The Director's report together
with the recommendations of the district judges and of the ju­
dicial councils were considered by the Committee on Bankruptcy
Administration. The Conference had before it the Committee's
report as well as the recommendations of the district judges and
the judicial councils. Upon the recommendation of the Com­
mitee on Bankruptcy Administration, the Conference took the

     REPORT CONCERNING CERTAIN PENDING LEGISLATION REFERRED TO
       THE BANKRUPTCY COMMITTEE RELATING fro THE SUBJECT OF
       RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES AND THEIR COMPENSATION

       Pursuant to the direction of the Judicial Conference at its special
     session in April 1954, the Director on May 22, 1954, circulated
                                     14 

among the circuit and district judges (1) a copy of a report dated                ~
February 5,1954, of a subcommittee of the Bankruptcy Committee                    """
appointed to study and report on the subject of receivers and
trustees and their compensation including S. 2344, S. 2560, S. 2561,
S. 2562, S. 2563, and H. R. 4400, 83d Congress, and (2) a copy of a
report of the Bankruptcy Committee dated April 14, 1954, approv­
ing the report of the subcommittee. The Director's letter re­
quested the judges and the judicial conferences and judicial
councils of the circuits to express their views upon the report.
   The Committee after considering the replies received, recom­
mended that the report of the Bankruptcy Committee dated April
14, 1954 approving the report of the subcommittee dated February
5, 1954 (which opposed the enactment of all the bills mentioned
above), be approved.
   The Conference adopted the recommendation of the Bankruptcy
Committee.
             COMPENSATION OF RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES
   The report of the subcommittee of February 5, 1954, also dealt
with the question of increasing the compensation to be provided for
receivers and trustees. The subcommittee expressed the view that
in some districts too many nonasset cases were being administered
without the appointment of a trustee, the inevitable result of which
                                                                                  0

His to permit the undervaluation of property claimed as exempt by
the bankrupt and natural carelessness in the scheduling of assets."
With regard to this portion of the subcommittee report the Con­
ference adopted the following resolution recommended by the
Committee:
        BE IT RESOLVED: That it is the sense of the Conference
     that a greater use of trustees in the administration of nonasset
     cases should be made by the referees in bankruptcy. And be
     it further resolved that the following maximum rates of com­
     pensation for trustees be provided by amendment of Sec. 48c
      (1) of the Bankruptcy Act to wit:
    10 percent on the firsL________________________________________     $500.00
    6 percent on the nexL__________________ ______________________     1,000.00
    3 percent on the nexL_______________________________________       8,500.00
    3 percent on the nexL ________________________________________    15,000.00
    1 percent on all above ________________________________________   25,000.00

    together with an increase in the discretionary allowance from
    $100 as now provided in the subsection to the sum of $150.
                         LEGISLATIVE MATTERS                                      -
  At the regular session of the Judicial Conference held in Septem­               "'­
ber 1953, the Bankruptcy Committee recommended and the Con­
                                      15 

    ference approved legislation dealing with the subject of unclaimed

-   moneys in bankruptcy cases and legislation which would provide
    for the combining of the notice of the time fixed for filing objections
    to the discharge of the bankrupt with the notice of the first meet­
    ing of creditors wherever possible. Bills amending the applicable
    sections of the Bankruptcy Act were submitted to the 83d Con­
    gress and introduced in the House of Representatives as H. R. 8209
    and H. R. 8210 respectively. H. R. 8210 providing for the com­
    bining of such notices passed the House of Representatives but
    failed to be enacted by the Senate. No action was taken on H. R.
    8209 relating to unclaimed moneys.
       The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
    previous approval of both proposals. This recommendation was
    approved.
      PROCUREMENT OF SPACE FOR REFEREES IN FEDERAL BUILDINGS

       The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference the
    pressing need for additional space in Federal buildings for referees'


-   offices sufficient to handle the volume of work now before them
    and pointed out that a number of part-time positions have already
    been changed to full-time positions and that many more such
    changes as well as additional full-time positions will be recom­
    mended shortly. It also pointed out that in several cities where
    requests for space are now pending, the Post Office and Courthouse
    buildings are presently providing a large amount of space for non~
    court executive agencies of the Government other than the Post
    Office Department. The Committee felt that because of the n~
    ture of the work of the referees and their constant contact with
    the district judges and clerks of court, priority should be given to
    the referees in the assignment of space in these buildings and that
    it is essential to have them adequately housed in Federal buildings
    in close proximity to the district judges and district clerks.
       The Committee recommended the following resolution which
    was adopted by the Conference:
           Resolved, That it is the sense of the Conference that the
        referees in bankruptcy are performing a very important ju­
        dicial function in the United States District Courts and be­
        cause of their constant contact with the district judges and the
        clerks of courts, it is imperative that adequate office and court­
        room space be provided in Post Office and Courthouse build­
        ings for these officers and further that in the providing of such
                                16 


    space a priority be given to the needs of the referees over the
    needs of noncourt executive agencies other than the Post Office
    Departmen t.
                     BANKRUPTCY-GENERAL

  The Conference adopted the following resolution:
       It appearing to the Conference, from the report of the Bank­
   ruptcy Committee, that there has been a complaint of irregu­
    larity in a bankruptcy proceeding in one of the circuits, the
    Conference refers the matter to the Judicial Council of the
    circuit, and requests the Administrative Office to bring it to
    the attention of the Department of Justice.
REFERENCE TO BANKRUPTCY COMMITTEE OF PROPOSAL TO INCREASE
                 SALARIES OF FULL-TIME REFEREES

  Judge Maris brought to the attention of the Conference a recom­
mendation of the Judicial Conference of the Third Circuit that the
statutory ceiling on salaries which can be authorized for full-time
referees be increased from $12,500 per year to $15,000 per year.
The recommendation was referred to the Bankruptcy Committee
for consideration.
                THE COUR'l' REPORTING SYSTEM

  The Director reported to the Conference on the operation of
the court reporting system during the fiscal year 1954 and the
earnings of court reporters. The Conference was informed that
the general increases in salaries authorized for court reporters
at the September 1953 session to take effect July 1, 1954, con­
tingent upon the necessary appropriation had been made effective
as of that date after favorable action by the Congress.
                 GENERAL INCREASES IN SALARIES

  The Director reported to the Conference that in his judg­
ment there was little if any real difference in the situation of
reporters in the $4,200 salary class and those in the $4,500 class
and that the consolidation of the two classes at the higher rate
would seem to be logical. Seventeen reporters would be affected.
He recommended that the Conference authorize such an increase
subject to the availability of funds. The recommendation was
approved by the Conference.                                           -
                                     17
                      CHANGES IN SPECIFIC. SALARIES

-      The Director recommended that the court reporters for the
    Eastern District of Missouri with headquarters at St. Louis be
    placed in the $6,000 salary class instead of the present $5,500
    salary class subject to the availability of funds. The recom­
    mendation was approved by the Conference.
       The Director also recommended that the reporters for the West­
    ern District of Washington and the reporter for the Eastern and
    Western Districts of Washington be placed in the $6,000 salary
    class instead of the present $5,500 salary class subject to the avail­
    ability of funds. The recommendation was approved by the Con­
    ference.
       The Conference was informed that Mr. John R. Shaughnessy,
    one of the official court reporters for the Western District of
    Pennsylvania, intends to resign his position; that the District
    Court for that district proposes to appoint Mr. Shaughnessy
    United States Commissioner and requests that he be authorized
    in addition to act as an official reporter on a per diem basis from


-
    time to time when needed to serve retired Judge McVicar or
    for other special assignments. The approval of the Conference
    for such a combination of duties is required by Title 28, U. S. 0;,
    § 753 (a). The Director recommended the proposed arrange­
    ment and the Conference approved it.
       A combination position of court reporter and secretary at a
    salary of $6,000 was authorized for the District of New Mexico
    to serve the judgeship now held by Judge Waldo H. Rogers of
    tha t District.
      In compliance with a request from Judge Charles N. Pray of
    the District of Montana, the combination position of court re­
    porter and secretary heretofore authorized by the Conference for
    him was enlarged to include also the duties of law clerk at no in­
    crease in salary.
      The Conference in July of 1954, authorized by mail a change in
    the reporting position for Judge Fred M. Taylor of the District
    of Idaho to the combination position of court reporter and sec­
    retary at a salary of $6,000 per year. Also in July of 1954, the
    Conference by mail authorized the following arrangement for
    court reporting service for the Middle District of Georgia:
           Middle District of Georgia.-A new alternative position of
         reporter to serve also as secretary for the judgeship now held
         by Judge W. A. Bootle at a salary of $6,000 per annum, is
                                18 

      authorized, if the Judge should find that preferable to the
      position presently authorized for a reporter who acts solely
      in that capacity at a salary of $4,500 per annum.
    Both of these actions were confirmed .
 .. For the District of Minnesota the appointment of one addi­
tional reporter at a salary of $5,500 per year was authorized. This
will provide for that district a number of reporters equal to the
number of active judges and is in compliance with a request re­
ceived from the court.
                         ApPROPRIATIONS

   The Director submitted to the Conference for its approval pur­
suant to the statute (28 U. S. C. 605) estimates for supplemental
appropriations for the current fiscal year, and for annual appro­
priations for the fiscal year 1956.
   In the Appropriation Act for the courts for the current fiscal
year appropriations were allowed in an amount sufficient to pro­
vide for not more than 15 of the 30 additional judgeships authorized
by Public Law 294, approved February 10, 1954, on the ground
that not all of the new judges would be appointed and serve
throughout the year. However, more than 15 of the new judges
have now been appointed and are serving so that additional funds
for their salaries, the salaries of supporting personnel and miscel­
laneous expenses will be required by supplemental appropriations,
although the exact amount will have to be determined later.
Other items for which it appears that additional funds will be
needed during the current year, but for which accurate estimates
cannot be made so early in the year are pensions for widows of
Justices of the Supreme Court pursuant to Public Law 702, ap­
proved August 28, 1954, fees of jurors and United States commis­
sioners, salaries and expenses of referees in bankruptcy, including
changes in salaries of referees authorized to be effective Janu­
ary 1, 1955, and contribution to the cost of Employees' Group
Life Insurance under Public Law 598, approved August 17, 1954.
The Director accordingly recommended and the Conference ap­
proved the submission of supplemental estimates in such amounts
as may be found to be required, leaving the specific amounts for
later determination by the Director.
   The Director explained the estimates submitted for the fiscal
year 1956, which include a number of increases required by reason
of the larger number of judges authorized by Congress who will be
serving throughout the year, the expanding business of the courts
                                         19 

    which requires additional personnel and the inadequacy of appro­
    priations for the current fiscal year. He pointed out that the
    estimates did not include provision for increases in the number
    and salaries of court reporters and referees in bankruptcy author­
    ized by the Conference at this session, nor the Government's con­
    tribution to the cost of Employees' Group Life Insurance under
    the recently enacted Public Law 598, the amount of which is as
    yet undetermined. The Conference approved the estimates as
    6ubmitted and authorized the Director to include these additional
    items.
    WAYS AND MEANS OF CONFORMING EXPENDITURES WITH THE
      ApPROPRIATIONS FOR SALARIES OF SUPPORTING PERSONNEL AND
      TRAVEL AND MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES IN               1955
       The Director reported that the appropriations allowed by the
    Congress for the support of the courts during the current fiscal
    year are substantially below the amounts necessary to operate the
    courts of appeals and district courts on the general basis of the
    last fiscal year, and provide throughout the year for 15 of the 30

-   additional judges authorized by Public Law 294. Therefore
    rigorous measures to reduce expenditures must be invoked to avoid
    violation of the Anti-deficiency Act (31 U. S. C. sec. 665). Specific
    measures to this end were recommended.
       It is the considered view of the Conference that taking these
    actions will seriously impair the efficient operation of the courts,
    but that the terms of the Anti-deficiency Act seem to leave no
    choice. Accordingly, the measures recommended by the Director
    were approved, with the understanding that at the earliest oppor­
    tunity when Congress reconvenes for its next session the situation
    will be laid before the Congress and supplemental appropriations
    requested.
       The recommendations of the Director which were approved by
    the Conference are as follows:
             I. The Appropriation for SaZaries of Supporting Personnel

      Temporary employments and overlapping employments will need to be avoided.
    When changes oCCur in supporting personnel it will be necessary to postpone
    the entry on duty of new employees untll any leave with pay of tbeir predeces­
    sors bas expired. The funds will not support temporary employments while
    regular personnel are on vacation. Only in situations of extreme need amount­
    ing to emergency can exceptions be made. These courses will be necessary In
    order to maintain within grade promotions and normal reclassifications when
    earned.

       II. The Appropria,tion lor Tt'aveZ and MisoellaneOlt8 Ell!penses

 1. 'l'he Funtls lot' E;r;pe1!ses 01 Travel
    (a) 	Means of saving in the travel of personnel aeeompanying judges in
        service away from their official stations:
           That when a district court sits in a location where there is a. deputy
         clerk in residence, only one other member of the clerk's staff attend
         in a travel status, and that when a district court sits ill a location
         where there is no resident deputy clerk, not more than two members
        of the clerk's staff attend in a travel status. This is on the assumption
         that court is held in the location by only one judge. If more than one
         judge sits, more of the clerk's staff may need to attend. But the
         number under all conditions should be held to a minimum.
           That when a district judge hollIs court away from his headquarters
         he normally be accompanied by only his law clerk or secretary, and
         not by both, and that circuit judges on brief absences from their head­
         quarters follow the same course,
           That whenever possible judges dispense with the attendance of their
         criers during service in places away from their headquarters and involv­
         ing travel. When deputy clerks or law clerks accompany judges on
         their official trips, it would seem that usually in the fiseal situation this
         year, they could perform the duties also of crier.
           That where travel by automobile is practicable and conditions permit,
         the fullest use be made of the practice for judges and supporting per­
         sonnel of the courts to travel in automolJiles together,
    (b) 	Reduction of the travel expenses of the probation officers,
            The allotments for travel of probation officers will be reduced during
         the second, third and fourth quarters to the extent necessary to reduce
         the total allotment for travel of probation officers for the year by the
         amount of $50,000.
 2. The Funds for ImpersonaZ Empenses Other than Travel
       The supplying of office machines will be limited to the number impera­
    tively required.
       Continuation service on law works of judges is suspended except for
    works· which are indispensable, such as statutes, reports of decisions, and
    the like. Continuation service to court libraries used by numbers of judges
    will be maintained.
       The law works being furnished to the new judges will be far below the
    basic libraries of judges and any expansion will have to be deferred.
       Rebinding cannot be provided for and requests for it are suspended.
       Printing other than the printing of opinions, especially the printing of
    special forms where there are general forms, is restricted.
       Additions or improvements in telephone service entailing additional costs
    cannot be authorized under present conditions.

                      OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM

  Judge Watkins, chairman, submitted the report of the Com­
mittee on Operation of the Jury System.
  In conformity with the instruction of the Conference at the
September 1953 session (Cf. Rep. pp. 18-19) the proposal to
                                 21 

amend section 1871 of Title 28, United States Code, relating to
allowances for jurors, with particular reference to the provision
for the payment of travel expense at the rate of 7 cents a mile
when jurors return to their homes each night during their term
of service, had been circulated for an expression of the views of
the judges. After considering the replies of the judges, and
recent reports of the Administrative Office with regard to pay­
ments made to jurors since the distribution of the Committee
report the Committee did not for the present urge the adoption
 of the proposed amendment. Instead the Committee recom­
mended that the Administrative Office be instructed through its·
audit section to keep constant, close watch of payments to jurors;
that the Office make it a regular practice when payment for interim
daily travel appears to be excessive in any district, to call the
facts to the attention of the judges of the district concerned, sug­
gesting possible means by which jury expenses might be reduced,
based on experience in other courts. The recommendation of the
Committee was approved. In accordance with the Committee's
suggestion the Conference again calls to the attention of the judges
the discretion given by U. S. C. Title 28, § 1871, to limit daily
travel to that which is "necessary", and to require the payment
of only "subsistence at $5 per day" when in the court's opinion
daily travel appears impracticable; and under U. S. C. Title 28,
§ 1865, to select jurors from only those parts of the district. which
are close enough to the place where the term of the court is to be
held so that "unnecessary expense" and "burden" upon the citi­
zens of any part of the district will be avoided. These provisions
have been useful in most districts in preventing excessive jury
travel costs and there is no reason why they should not be so used
in all.
   The Committee also reported that after a canvass of the ju­
diciary for suggestions it had completed a revision of the jurors'
handbook which it considers suitable for use in all district courts.
The Conference approved the revised edition of the handbook
and authorized the Administrative Office to have it printed and
distributed for use in courts where the judges desire to have it.
   The Committee reported that the bill heretofore approved by
the Conference to provide uniform qualifications for jurors (8
961 of the 83d Congress) was the subject of a hearing before the
Senate Judiciary Committee in March of 1953, but did not ad­
                                22
vance further during the Congress. The Conference reaffirmed           Iff'
its approval of the proposed legislation, the reintroduction and       .f_, '
enactment of which will be sought in the next Congress.
   The Committee reported that the bill to provide for a jury
commission for each United States district court, to regulate its
compensation, to prescribe its duties, and for other purposes (S.
959 of the 83d Congress), passed the Senate the latter part of the
last session of Congress with amendments in the form approved
by the Judicial Conference. Efforts to secure its consideration
by the House Judiciary Committee were unavailing. The Con~
ference reaffirmed its recommendation of the proposed legislation
in the form in which it passed the Senate.
   A report of the Administrative Office on the cost of operation
of the jury system was submitted and its circulation among the
judges authorized.
                 COMMITTEE ON HABEAS CORPUS

   At the September 1953 session, the Conference directed that the
former Committee on Habeas Corpus be reactivated to consider
questions with regard to applications to Federal courts for the writ
of habeas corpus by persons imprisoned under judgments or sen­
tences of State courts. (Cf. Rep. p. 27.) This subject had been
mentioned by the Attorney General in his report to the Conference
in 1953 and resolutions with respect to it had been passed by the
Conference of Chief Justices, the Association of State Attorneys
General, and the Section of Judicial Administration of the Amer­
ican Bar Association.
   Judge Parker, Chairman of the Committee, submitted a report
and supplement. The Committee had the assistance of representa­
tives of the Conference of Chief Justices and of the Association of
State Attorneys General at its meetings. A proposed amendment
to section 2254 of Title 28, United States Code, developed by the
Committee has the approval of these representatives.
   The Committee found that many persons convicted by State
courts are seeking release from State penal institutions by writs of
habeas corpus in Federal courts claiming that constitutional rights
had been denied them in the State courts; that although only an
insignificant number of these petitions had been successful they
had imposed an unnecessary burden 011 the Federal courts, and
greatly interfered with the procedure of the State courts. The
Committee was of the opinion that where adequate procedure is
                                      23 

provided by State law for the handling of such claims the remedy
should be sought in the State courts with review of State court
action only by the Supreme Court of the United States and that
resort to the Federal courts by habeas corpus should be reserved
for situations where an adquate record cannot be made in the State
court. Accordingly the Committee proposed that § 2254 of Title
28, United States Code, be amended by adding thereto a new sub­
section (b) as follows:
  A Justice of the Supreme Court, a Circuit Judge or a District Court or Judge
shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person
in custody pursuant to a judgment of a State court, only on a gTound Which
presents a substantial Federal constitutional question (1) which was not there­
tofore raised and determined (2) which there was no fair and adequate oppor­
tunity theretofore to raise and have determined and (3) which cannot thereafter
be raised and determined in a proceeding in the State court, by an order or
judgment subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States on writ
of certiorari.
  An order denying an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person
in custody pursuant to a judgment of a State court shall be reviewable only
on a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court of the United States. The petition
for the writ of certiorari shall be filed within 30 days after the entry of such
order.
   The Conference directed that the report of the Committee and
the supplement be circulated among the judiciary for an expres­
sion of views.
                           PRETRIAL PROCEDURE

   The report of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure was made by
Judge Murrah, its chairman, and Judge Laws, a member of the
Committee also supported its recommendations. Judge Murrah
stated that the use of pretrial conferences was expanding both in
State and Federal courts and detailed some of the activities of the
Committee. The Committee is convinced that substantial sav­
ings in time and money result from the use of pretrial. It con­
siders it important that newly appointed judges 1;Je informed of
the advantages of the procedure and the most effective methods
of using it. To that end the Chairman has corresponded with
each district judge who has been appointed during the last several
years, and when feasible, contact has been arranged between the
new judge and a member of the Committee or an experienced pre­
trial judge in the circuit and a considerable amount of educational
work has been done.
   The following recommendations designed to strengthen the
Committee and bring about closer and more effective cooperation
                                        24 


of the circuit committees were then presented to the Conference
and approved by it:                                                                   ()
  1. Be it resQlved, That the Committee recommends that there be appointed
or reconstituted by the chief judge of each circuit of the United States a Pre­
trial Committee in each circuit and that on the day preceding the meetIng of
the Conference of the circuit the Pretrial Committee shall be called in session,
and
  Be it further resQZved, That the Committee recommends that the Chairman
of the Circuit Committee or some other judge be designated by the chief judge of
the circuit to make arrangements to acquaint all newly appointed judges with
pretrial procedure and the technique of its employment.
  2. It is recommended that the Judicial Conference Committee on Pretrial be
reconstituted with one member from each circuit who is an experienced pretrial
judge.
   A suggestion for a meeting in Washington of the new judges in
the first four circuits and the District of Columbia for a pretrial
demonstration and a discussion of pretrial techniques was found
not to be feasible at this time because of the expense involved.
   Judge Murrah also presented for the consideration of the Con­
ference the following recommendation for setting up a panel of
judges with experience and aptitude in the handling of antitrust
and other protracted cases to help the judges to whom such cases
are assigned, if the trial judge requests it:
  3. It is recommended that the Judicial Conference approve the appointment
by the Chief Justice of the United States of a panel of district judges consisting
of one or more from each circuit who shall make a study of the special problems
in the pretrial of long and complicated cases, the study to be under the auspices
of the Pretrial Committee and in conference with leading trial counsel: that this
panel be authorized to meet in conference; and that after the formation and
study of such panel, it be adopted as the policy of the Judicial Conference of the
United States that in antitrust and similar complicated and protracted cases one
of the judges of this panel be available to the judge who will try the case, on
his request and upon designation by the chief judge of the circuit, for consulta­
tion or to sit jointly in the pretrial conferences, or to assist in such manner and
to such extent as the trial judge may deem advisable.
   Judge Prettyman informed the Conference that his Committee
on Procedure in Antitrust and other Protracted Cases had con­
sidered the resolution and that although it had some doubt as to
the practicability of the suggested plan it considered it to be worthy
of consideration as a possible help in the economical disposition of
these complex cases, and therefore, without affirmative endorse­
ment passed the resolution to the Conference for its consideration.
   The Conference received the report of the Committee and
directed that it be circulated throughout the Judiciary with a re­
quest for an expression of the views of the judges with respect to
recommendation 3, concerning the creation of a panel of judges
                                           25 

     experienced in handling antitrust cases, to be followed by a further
     report of the Committee.
     COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE IN ANTITRUST AND OTHER PROTRACTED
                                        CASES

       Judge Prettyman, Chairman, submitted a report for the Com­
     mittee on Procedure in Antitrust and other Protracted Cases.
       The Conference was informed of the consideration given by the
     Committee, meeting with Judge Murrah and Judge Laws of the
     Committee on Pretrial Procedure, to the recommendation of the
     latter Committee concerning the appointment of a panel of district
     judges to give particular attention to the use of pretrial in long
     complicated cases to which reference has already been made.
       Three recommendations addressed to the Judicial Conference
     by the Conference on Administrative Procedure called by the
     President of the United States had been considered by the Com­
     mittee. The first is as follows:
        1!Jxclusion of Evidence.-That the United States Courts be urged to encourage
     hearing officers and agencies in formal administrative proceedings to exclude
     irrelevant, immaterial, and repetitious evidence.
""
        This recommendation which had been approved by the Commit­
     tee was approved by the Conference.
        The second recommendation proposed the adoption of a uniform
     rule reI a ting to the certification and filing of the record on review
     of administrative agency proceedings. It was pointed out that the
     Conference on recommendation of the Committee on Revision of
     the Laws, and after circulation among the judges for an expression
     of views, had recommended for enactment the draft of a proposed
     bill under which agencies would be permitted to send to the review­
     ing court an abbreviated record where the whole record is not
     necessary and to authorize the use of the original papers in lieu of
     a transcript (Cf. Reps. September 1953 session, p. 25, April ses­
     sion 1954, p. 17). Accordingly no action was taken by the Confer­
     ence with regard to this recommendation.
        The third recommendation urged that the courts of appeals uni­
     formly adopt the joint appendix system for records on review of
     agency proceedings and require briefs to be filed in advance of
     printing the appendix record. The Committee without expressing
     approval or disapproval recommended that this suggested pro­
     cedure be called to the attention of the several courts of appeals
for possible use in instances where its value seems to be indicated,
and the Conference adopted the Committee's recommendation.              ()
   The Committee informed the Conference that Assistant Attor­
ney General Stanley N. Barnes, who is head of the Antitrust Divi­
sion of the Department of Justice and Cochairman of the Attorney
General's National Committee To Study Antitrust Law accompa­
nied by members of his staff had met with the Committee. Later
he had submitted comments and suggestions in the form of a letter.
The Committee was of the view that the suggestions and comments
of Judge Barnes do not call for affirmative action by the Commit­
tee, but that they should be circulated to all Federal judges as part
of the Committee's report.
   The Committee also informed the Conference that the American
Bar Association Committee on Practice and Procedure in the Trial
of Antitrust Cases had prepared a report which the Committee,
without expressing either agreement or disagreement with the
suggestions contained in it, considered to be a thoughtful and
valuable contribution to the solution of the problem with which
the Committee is concerned. It recommended that the Director
of the Administrative Office be instructed to circulate copies of
the report to all Federal judges if arrangements can be made with       ~
the American Bar Association to supply the necessary copies. The
recommendation was approved by the Conference.
   The Conference was informed that because of the numerous
requests for them, the supply of copies of the Report of the Com­
mittee adopted by the Conference in 1951, is now exhausted. The
Committee recommended that the 1951 report be reprinted in an
adequate number and that the present report be printed as a
supplement with a sufficient number of copies to permit distribu­
tion to all Federal judges and to members of the bar who may
request them. The Conference approved this recommendation.
              COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS

   Judge Maris, Chairman of the Committee on Revision of the
Laws, submitted an interim report on behalf of the Committee.
   The Committee requested and was given further time to con­
sider a recommendation of the Judicial Council of the District of
Columbia Circuit that certain statutes be amended so as to elimi­
nate the present requirements that 5 days' notice be given before
temporary stays may be granted in cases involving the review of
                                 27 

the orders of the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Federal Communi­
cations Commission, the Federal Maritime Board, and the Secre­
tary of Agriculture. This matter was referred to the Committee
at the April 1954 session (Cf. Rep. p. 19).
   The Committee reported on a proposal made by Professor
George B. Fraser of the College of Law of the University of
Oklahoma for amendment in two particulars of § 1441 of Title
28, United States Code, pertaining to the removal of cases from
State courts. This matter was also referred to the Committee at
the April 1954 session (Cf. Rep. p. 19). The first recommenda­
tion is that the statute be amended so as to permit the removal
of a case improperly brought in the State court and of which
that court does not have jurisdiction because exclusive jurisdic­
tion has been given by Congress to the Federal courts. The second
is that removal be authorized from the State to the Federal court
if at the time of removal instead of at the time it was brought
in the State court it appears from either the complaint or the
petition for removal that the action involves a Federal question.
The Committee did not favor the first proposed amendment and
recommended that the second be circulated among the judges for
an expression of views. The Conference directed that both of
the proposals be so circulated.
   At the April 1954 session of the Conference, Chief Judge Gar­
rett and Judge Johnson of the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals and Chief Judge Oliver and Judge Ekwall of the Customs
Court discussed with the Conference bills then pending in Con­
gress (H. R. 7864, S. 3131; H. R. 6919, S. 2975 of the 83d Congress),
which would declare their courts to be established under Article
III of the Constitution, and provide for the temporary assign­
ment of judges from other courts to those courts and from those
courts to other courts (Cf. Rep. p. 14). The bills were then
referred to the Committee on Revision of the Laws for study and
report to the next session of the Conference. The Committee
informed the Conference that it considered the provisions of the
bills desirable but that it apprehended that the question as to
whether the declaration proposed by the bills respecting the estab­
lishment of the courts under Article III would be constitutionally
effective is a judicial question for determination by the Federal
courts and not within the competence of the Judicial Conference
or its committees. Upon consideration of the Committee's report,
                                 .28 

the Conference, expressing no view with reference to their consti­
tutionality, approved the proposed legislation contained in the bills.
  The Committee recommended that the Conference suggest to
the Supreme Court the adoption under section 2074 of Title 28,
United States Code (Act of July 27, 1954, 68 Stat. 567), of a
rule providing that the review of decisions of the Tax Court shall
be begun by the filing in that court of a notice of appeal in form
analogous to that prescribed by rule 73 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, which shall be the petition for review referred
to ill sections 7481, 7482, 7483, and 7485 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954. The Conference approved the recom­
mendation.
       DISQUALIFICATION OF JUDGE FOR BIAS OR PREJUDICE

  The attention of the Conference was called to S. 3517 of the
83d Congress, relating to disqualification of a judge for bias or
prejudice which was favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary
Committee. The bill was referred to the Committee on Revision
of the Laws for consideration and also for circulation among the
judges for an expression of views.
                       JUDICIAL STATISTICS

  Judge Clark, Chairman of the Committee on Judicial Statistics,
presented the report of the Committee. He referred to the use­
fulness of the statistical information and reports of the Admin­
istrative Office concerning the business of the courts to the Ju­
dicial Conference, to Congress and to scholars and teachers, and
said that the Committee thought the reports also had great po­
tential usefulness to individual district judges who have dockets
to maintain and a definite list of cases to dispose of. The Com­
mittee has been reviewing the form and contents of the tables
published in the quarterly and annual reports of the Adminis­
trative Office and has solicited advice and suggestions regard­
ing them from all judges.
   He reported that the Committee was particularly desirous of
acquainting the newly appointed district judges with the value
and possible use by them of the statistical information available
in the Administrative Office, and the Chairman has been writing
to each district judge at the time of his appointment, explaining
the general plan for the collection and publication of this material.
                                      29 

    A handbook on Federal court statistics, a preliminary draft of
    which was included in the Committee report last year, will be
    completed and made available this year.
       Judge Clark pointed out that statistics may show the lack of
    need for additional judgeships as well as the need for them, as
    illustrated by a careful analysis of the judicial business of Maine,
    New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Wyoming, con­
    tained in the Committee report. An additional judgeship for each
    of these districts was included in S. 2910, and the report pointed
    out that a statement by the Conference with reference to the lack
    of need for additional judge power in these districts would be an
    appropriate exercise of the responsibility which is assigned to the
    Conference, if the bill should be reintroduced.
       The Committee recommended to the judicial councils of the
    circuits that they regularly follow up the quarterly reports of
    cases under advisement by the district judges and that where cases
    are reported which have been under advisement for more than 6
    months, they should ascertain the reason for such delay and when
    feasible, offer to send in a judge from another district to help if the

-   judge who is in arrears should so desire.
       Judge Clark also announced the plan of the Committee to make
    a time study again with the help of a few district judges, as to the
    time spent by them on various types of cases. The Conference
    directed that the report be received and that it be circulated
    throughout the judiciary for the information of the judges.
                 COMMITrEE ON PUNISHMENT FOR CruME
       The Conference authorized the Chief Justice to reconstitute the
    Committee on Punishment for Crime for the purpose of consider­
    ing the proposal advanced by the Attorney General in his report
    that criminal sentences be made reviewable on appeal with power
    in the appellate court to increase or decrease the punishment.
       A proposal made by Representative Charles E. Bennett of
    Florida that the right to bail for defendants charged with crimes
    of a subversive nature be restricted was also referred to this
    Committee.
    PROPOSAL To AMEND THE PROBATION LAW To PERMIT CONFINE­
               MENT IN CONNECTION WITH PROBATION
      A recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
    Circuit that the probation law be amended so as to permit con­
                                 30 

finement in jail-type institutions or treatment institutions for a
period not exceeding 6 months in connection with the grant of pro­
bation on a I-count indictment was ordered referred to a committee
for study and report.
        QUARTERS OF THE CoURTS AND RELATED FACILITIES

   Hon. Edmund F. Mansure, Administrator of the General Serv­
ices Administration, and Hon. Peter A. Strobel, Commissioner of
the Public Buildings Service, discussed with the Conference prob­
lems relating to the need for additional space for court activities
and particularly the acute need for air conditioning of court quar­
ters in many places. The appointment of a Committee on Air
Conditioning was authorized. It is intended that this Committee
will consider and formulate principles for determining the relative
need for air conditioning and will ask the judicial councils of the
circuits to determine which courthouses in their respective circuits
would qualify for installation of air conditioning according to the
standards outlined by the Committee.
               NEW COURTHOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO

   Judge Denman submitted a resolution of the Judicial Conference       0>
of the Ninth Circuit recommending the construction of a new
courthouse at San Francisco, Calif., with accommodations for the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the District Court for
the Northern District of California.
   The resolution was approved by the Conference and the con­
struction of the proposed new building is recommended.
                COURTHOUSE AT ANCHORAGE, ALASKA

  Judge Denman informed the Conference that the Judicial
Council of the Ninth Circuit had adopted the following resolution:
       "\Vhereas the Third Division of Alaska has litigation requir­
    ing the services of two district judges, a requirement inade­
    quately served by the infrequent sittings of judges from other
    Divisions of Alaska, and whereas the Judicial Conference of
    the United States has recommended to Congress the creation
    of a second judgeship for the Third Division; and whereas the
    present facilities even for one district judge are grossly inade­
    quate because largely occupied by other Government activi­
    ties: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit, That
    the Judicial Conference of the United States recommend to
                                          31 


"" 	          the Congress that in Anchorage, Alaska, a new building be
':wII 	       constructed in connection with the structure there containing
               the present court and its facilities, providing a second court­
               room and its facilities and further accommodations for other
              governmental activities, including those now using part of the
               present court facilities.
            The Conference approved the resolution and recommends the
          improvement of the court facilities at Anchorage in accordance
          therewith.
                      SOUND RECORDING OF COURT PROCEEDINGS

            Judge Laws, Chairman of the Committee on the Sound Record­
          ing of Court Proceedings, submitted a progress report. The Con­
          ference was informed that a number of experiments in sound
          recording of court proceedings have been made and it is the purpose
          of the Committee to continue t{) observe the development of the
          art of sound recording. A point has been reached, however, where
          a study of methods and types of equipment by an expert and im­
          partial agency is necessary for further progress, and that will in­
          volve cost estimated at approximately $6,000. The Conference
          authorized the Committee to go on with its consideration and
          procure a study of the kind indicated when and if funds are avail­
          able for this purpose.
                                 INDIGENT LITIGANTS

            The Conference was informed that the bills of the type which it
          had approved to provide for the appointment of public defenders
          by district courts which desired or in the alternative the allowance
          of compensation to counsel appointed in individual cases under
          specified conditions, H. R. 398 and H. R. 2091 of the 83d Congress,
          had been the subject of a hearing before a Subcommittee of the
          House Judiciary Committee. The Committee however did not re­
          port such a bill. Instead a substitute bill providing only for a
          system of small fees of flat sums per case for appointed counsel,
          H. R. 10158, was reported by the Committee and passed the House
          of Representatives. It was not considered in the Senate prior to
          the adjournment of Congress. The Conference reaffirmed its
          approval of the legislation embodied in H. R. 398 and H. R. 2091
          and voted its disapproval of the substitute H. R.10158.
            The Conference is of the view that the proposed legislation in the
          form recommended by it should be reintroduced at the next session
          of Congress and its enactment sought. The Conference approved

  PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE C.oURTS OF APPEALS OF THE
                 EIGHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS

  At the request of Chief Judge Gardner, the Conference, pursu­
ant to Title 28, U. S. C. 48, consented that terms of the Court of
Appeals of the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be
pretermitted during the current fiscal year.
  At the request of Chief Judge Phillips, the Conference consented
that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit at Okla­
homa City, Okla., and Wichita, Kans., be pretermitted during the
current fiscal year.
FuNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE CoMMISSION IN
        CHAPTER    X   CASES UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY ACT

   Chairman Demmler of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
accompanied by Commissioner Armstrong and General Counsel
Timbers, discussed with the Conference the undertaking in which
the Commission is engaged to reexamine its functions under Chap­
ter X of the Bankruptcy Act. He explained that this has been             0>
found to be necessary because of budgetary and other considera­
tions, although he recognizes that substantial curtailment of the
Commission}s activities in these cases, by legislation or administra­
tive determination, might have a marked effect upon the work of
the courts. He submitted to the Conference the draft of a pro­
posed questionnaire which his Commission desires to have sub­
mitted to the judges for the purpose of eliciting information which
it is believed would be helpful for the determination of policy in
this field. The Administrative Office was authorized to submit
the questionnaire to the judges in behalf of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and transmit the answers to the
Commission.
  DISPOSITION OF OLD RECORDS OF CoURTS OF ApPEALS           NOT   OF
                         PERMANENT VALUE

  The Committee appointed at the April 1954 session to consider
a proposed schedule for the disposal of noncurrent records of the
courts of appeals (Cf. Rep. p. 16) submitted an interim report and
asked for further time to submit its final report. The request was
granted.

-.. RULES ADOPTED BY THE COURT OF ApPEALS FOR THE SECOND AND
'wi     SIXTH CIRCUITS FOR REVIEW OR ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS OF
        ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

        The Courts of Appeals for the Second and the Sixth Circuits sub­
      mitted to the Conference for approval pursuant to the provisions
      of the Act of December 29, 1950 (64 Stat. 1129; 5 U. S. C. 1041)
      rules adopted by those courts relating to the review and enforce­
      ment of orders of administrative agencies. The Conference ac­
      cordingly approved of Rule 13 of the Second Circuit and Rule 15
      of the Sixth Circuit as thus submitted.

         WAGES AND ji.iFFECTS OF DECEASED AND DESERTING SEAMEN

         The Conference was informed that the bill which it had ap­
      proved, S. 2017, to provide for a method of disposing of the wages
      and effects of deceased and deserting seamen (Cf. Rep. Sept. Sess.
      1951, p. 29) had passed the Senate during the second session of the
      83d Congress but was not acted upon by the House of Representa­
      tives. The Conference reaffirmed its approval of this legislation.

            PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO 'l'HE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT

         For a time last spring, the House Committee on Education
      and Labor had under consideration a proposed amendment to
      the Taft-Hartley Act which would provide that complaints of
      unfair labor practices would be prosecuted directly in the United
      States District Courts by the complainant or the United States
      Attorney instead of being handled at they now are by examiners
      of the National Labor Relations Board. At that time, the Con­
      ference by a mail vote opposed the proposed legislation. The
      Conference reviewed this action and it was ratified and reaffirmed.

      TRANSFER OF CASES BETWEEN THE DISTRICT COURTS AND THE
                              COURT OF CLAIMS

      The Director informed the Conference that he had received in­
    quiries from the respective chairmen of the Committees on the
    Judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives with re­
    gard to S. 3608 and H. R. 9346 of the 83d Congress, which were
-- companion bills providing for the transfer of cases between the
... district courts and the Court of Claims. The Conference ap­
    proved this proposed legislation.

   The Conference considered and approved the following resolu­
tion adopted by the Judicial Conference of the District of Colum­
bia Circuit June 24, 1954:
      Resolved by the Judicial Conference of the District of Co­
    lumbia Circuit, That it favors the enactment of legislation to
    make the provisions of the Federal Probation Act (sec. 3651
    through sec. 3656, Title 18, United States Code) applicable
    to the United States District Court for the District of Colum­
    bia, and to repeal those provisions of the separate Probation
    Act (see secs. 101 and 102 of Title 24, D. C. Code, 1951 ed.),
    now applicable to the United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia, without, however, abolishing the sepa­
    rate Parole Board in the District of Columbia.
      It is further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be
    presented to the Judicial Conference of the United States.

    to amend the first sentence of Section 608 of Title 23 of the
    District of Columbia Code (1951 ed.), relating to the regula­
    tion of bondsmen in the District of Columbia, by striking out
    the words "police court" and inserting in lieu thereof the
    words "Municipal Court for the District of Columbia", and
    by deleting the words "criminal divisions of the District

    trict Court for the District of Columbia."
       It is further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be
    presented to the Judicial Conference of the United States and
    to the appropriate committees of Congress.
INTEGRATION OF THE BAR OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

  The Conference considered a resolution adopted by the Ju­
dicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit June 24,
1954, favoring in principle a proposal of legislation for the es- ...;;
tablishment of an integrated bar in the District of Columbia.

          H. R. 9431 of the 83d Congress entitled "A Bill relating to the
        practice of law in the District of Columbia" was called to the
        attention of the Conference and referred to the Judicial Council
        of the District of Columbia Circuit for study and later report to the
        judicial Conference of the United States if desired.
                         ADDITIONAL DEPUTY MARSHALS

          The Director of the Administrative Office was directed to take
        up with the Department of Justice the matter of the appointment
        of additional deputy marshals in districts where it appears that
        there are not now an adequate number of deputy marshals for
        the needs of the courts.

        1948 session (Cf. Rep. p. 38), expressing its sense that the furnish­
        ing to judges of a separate digest of opinions of the Supreme Court
        of the United States would not be justified inasmuch as the judges
        were then being furnished with a combined digest of the opinions
        of the Federal courts including the Supreme Court.
                                SALARIES OF JUDGES

          The Conference reaffirmed the view expressed at the Apri11954
        session (Cf. Rep. p. 22), that substantial increases in the salaries
        of the judges of the United States courts are in the interest of
        maintaining the efficient administration of justice and again rec­
        ommends to the Congress the enactment of legislation to that end.

                                            APPENDIX
       REPORT OF HONORABLE HERBERT BROWNELL, JR., ATTORNEY
                              GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES

     Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference of the
         United States:
      Section 331 of Title 28, United States Code, provides in part:
       The Attorney General shall. upon request of the ChIef Justice, report to [the
     Judicial Conference of the United States] on matters relating to the business
     of the several courts of the United States, with particular reference to cases to
     which the United States is a party.
        Pursuant to the discretion vested in the Chief Justice by this
     language each year, since the origin of this Conference in 1922, the
     Chief Justice has extended an invitation to the Attorney General
     to participate in the Conference. To me it affords one of the
     greatest honors bestowed upon the Office of the Attorney General,
     for it is both a privilege and a pleasure to meet with the distin­
     guished members of this Conference, and to discuss with them the
     issues of current interest to the Bench, the Bar, and the Depart­
     ment of Justice. These conferences provide the opportunity to
     discuss both formally and informally the many problems of com­
     mon concern, and many times problems which have seemed insur­
     mountable have been readily resolved as a result of these meet­
     ings. Let me add, however, that this year we enjoy a state of
     complete unanimity of opinion with respect to the many important
     issues before the Judicial Conference.
        Last year, I reported on eight subjects. Some of these matters,
     because of recent developments, require brief treatment again this
     year. In addition, there are several new issues which I would
     commend to your attention.
        1. Public Defenders and Compensation of Assigned Counsel.­
     The Judicial Conference and the Department of Justice endorsed
     two bills in the Eighty-third Congress 1 (H. R. 398; H. R. 2091),
     believing that the enactment of either one would provide public
     defenders and assigned counsel under terms which would insure
     adequate representation to indigent defendants. On February 17,
--   1954, I had the honor to appear before a subcommittee of the House
       1   Unless otherwise stated, all bUl numbers /lIe ot the S8d Congress.
                                                   (37)
                                     38 

Judiciary Committee and make a statement in support of these
measures (see Committee Hearings, Serial No. 13, pp. 19-25).
Unfortunately, the full committee reported favorably on H. R.
10158, which makes no provision for either full- or part-time public
defenders but merely authorizes the district courts to allow counsel
fees not to exceed $250 in cases involving capital offenses and a
maximum of $100 in cases involving other felonies. I think these
maximum amounts clearly inadequate and that the technique
employed of setting an arbitrary ceiling most unfortunate. We
should have full-time public defenders in heavily populated dis­
tricts, and it seems to me that in less populated areas the court
should be provided a flexible system under which it could authorize
payment of counsel on a per diem basis. Certainly to provide in
advance that the maximum fee that can be allowed in a capital
case is $250 is most unrealistic. It could result in encouraging
pleas of guilty or hasty disposition of cases without adequate in­
vestigation of the facts or law involved. While lawyers have been
most generous of their time in rendering free legal service to per­
sons unable to afford counsel, the whole purpose of legislation of
this sort is to eliminate that haphazard method of procuring counsel
for the indigent. If proper evaluation and presentation of a
felony case would take 6 weeks, we should not limit compensation
                                                                                 o
to $100--an amount scarcely sufficient to compensate the attorney
for necessary expenses.
   The Department of Justice will again place legislation to provide
for public defenders on its legislative program. It is incumbent
upon us to demonstrate the shortcomings of a bill like H. R. 10158
and to persuade the Congress to enact legislation which will insure
adequate representation for the indigent.
   2. Concerning Judges-(a) Judicial Salaries.-At the time of
last year's Judicial Conference, a committee was studying the
adequacy of judicial salaries. The Report of the Commission on
Judicial and Congressional Salaries, which found that salaries "are,
and for a long time have been grossly inadequate," was filed, and
the recommendation incorporated into S. 1663. No action was
taken on the bill in the 83d Congress.
   The Department strongly favors an increase in judicial salaries.
A primary consideration is ably set forth in the Report of the Com­
mission at page 20, where it is stated:
  There have been many instances of able lawyers refusing judgeships because
their lack of independent means made it unfeasible for them to accept appoint­
                                        .39 

ment to the bench at present salaries. ... ... ... the maintenance of the democratic
tradition in this country requires that every effort be made to eliminate any
tendency which might confine representative pOSitions in our legislative branch
and the judicial branch to men of wealth or whose outside interests can produce
a substantial income. No citizen of modest means, possessing the ability, the
high-minded purpose, and the background to serve with distinction in these high
ofilces should ever be prevented from doing so because salaries haxe fallen below
any fair or realistic standard.
   Because present salaries are inadequate, the Department of
Justice will actively support legislation which, as the Report of
your Special Session in April found, is so clearly "in the interest of
maintaining the efficient administration of justice * * *."
   (b) Additional Judgeships.-The S3d Congress enacted leg­
islation to provide 3 new circuit judgeships, 27 new district
court judgeships, including 6 on a temporary basis, and made 3
judgeships permanent which heretofore had been only temporary.
These 33 new posts represent much that was sought and urgently
needed. I share your dismay in the failure of Congress to appro­
priate money to make it possible to fill these positions immediately.
I feel certain that Congress will correct this deficiency early next
year. However, as the Report of the Administrative Office of
the United States Courts points out, the bill fails to provide several
judgeships critically needed, particularly three more for the
Southern District of New York, where the case load per judge
is overwhelming, the dockets overflowing, and the time lag be­
tween filing and final disposition of a case is now 45 months. It
has been often observed that justice delayed is justice denied,
and it needs no argument on my part to persuade that a time
lag of almost 4 years in the Southern District of New York must
result in the denial of substantial justice in all too many cases.
The solution lies in expanding the courts to permit them to handle
all cases in prompt and orderly fashion. The statistics in that
Report also clearly justify the creation of additional judgeships
in other Districts, particularly in the Eastern District of Penn­
sylvania, the Northern District of Ohio, and the Third Division
of the Territory of Alaska. S. 2910, which was not acted on
in the S3d Congress, would have provided these and other positions.
It should be reintroduced and receive our joint endorsement.
   (c) Pensions for Widows of Federal Judges.-Public Law 702
of the S3d Congress provides pensions for the widows of Supreme
Court Justices only. As such, the bill falls far short of the recom­
mendation of this Conference, by failing to make provision for
                                40

the widows of all Federal judges. There can be no doubt but            '"
that an amendment should be introduced to rectify this omission,       J
and that the Department of Justice will support such a bill.
   (d) Retirement of Judge8.-The enactment of Public Law 294
had the effect of repealing subsection (c) of Section 371 of Title
28, United States Code, which provided for the appointment of
an additional judge when a disabled judge failed to retire and
the President found him disabled and that an additional appoint­
ment was necessary for the efficient dispatch of court business.
S. 2910, referred to above, would restore Section 371 (c) in its
original form.
  However, at its meeting on April 15-16, 1954, the Special Session
of the Judicial Conference renewed its prior recommendation that
the law be amended so as to authorize the President to appoint
an additional judge whenever a permanently disabled judge,
appointed to hold office during good behavior and eligible to retire
on account of permanent disability under Section 372 of Title
28, failed to do so, even though not eligible to retire on account
of age and length of service. The Special Session further recom­
mended that a certificate of disability should be executed by          o.
members of the judicial branch before the President could make
another appointment, but that the President should retain the
duty to find that the judge, by reason of his disability, could not
discharge his duties so that the appointment of an additional
judge was necessary.
  In a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
dated May 11, 1954, the Department concurred in the recom­
mendations of the Judicial Conference and this legislation should
again be placed before Congress.
  3. Rule8 for Review of Decisions of the Tax Court of the United
State8.-Public Law 538 of the 83d Congress provides that the
Supreme Court shall have power to prescribe, and from time to
time amend, uniform rules for the filing of petitions or notices of
appeal, the preparation of records, and the practice, forms, and
procedure in the several United States Courts of Appeals in pro­
ceedings for review of decisions of the Tax Court of the United
States. The Department of Justice conducts approximately 400
tax cases each year in the several courts of appeals, and our ex­
perience with the present divergent rules in these courts indicated    ~
the need for the promulgation of uniform rules. It is our opinion      .J
                                     41 

'~that such rules will result in substantial savings in both time and
..",I effort.
         The only opposition to the measure was that expressed by the
      late Chief Justice of the United States, Chief Justice Vinson, who
      felt that the Supreme Court should not be called upon to act in
      this rulemaking field, and that the courts of appeal were better
      adapted to determine, upon the basis of actual experience, what
      rules of procedure were needed. This Conference concurred in his
      position. However, the Supreme Court has previously promul­
      gated rules for the several District Courts of the United States and
      has prescribed rules of procedure for the admiralty courts. In my
      opinion, the Supreme Court is eminently qualified to establish uni­
      form rules to govern appeals from the Tax Court of the United
      States. Presumably a committee will be appointed to study the
      rules already in effect and to make recommendations for adopting
      the best features of them. In this connection the Department of
      Justice stands ready to aid the Court in any way we may be of
      assistance.
         4. Appellate Review of Federal Criminal Sentences.-Judge
.""'\ Sobeloff had hoped that he could be here this morning and asked
'wi that I extend to you his apology for being unavoidably absent. In
      a speech before the criminal section of the American Bar Associa­
      tion, Judge Sobeloff discussed what to me is a most important sub­
      ject. I will take the liberty of leaving several copies of it with
      you, as I view it as a most scholarly presentation of a most chal­
      lenging subject.
         Pointing out the many safeguards which are accorded to per­
      sons accused of crime to insure due process of law, the Solicitor
      General noted that in Federal courts one of the most important.
      steps is nonreviewable on appeal-the question of the proper sen­
      tence or final disposition of the case. Here the trial judge en­
      joys almost uncontrolled discretion; he may suspend sentence,
      place on probation, impose a nominal fine or a short prison term,
      or he may, as they say, "Throw the book" at the defendant. There
      are few, if any, guideposts for the trial judge to follow, for each
      case presents unique problems. As Judge Sobeloff said: "The
      truth is that passing sentence is too delicate and too powerful a
      function to lodge in any man's hands entirely unsupervised."
-- There is no one ideal solution to this problem. This Conference,
. . I know, has in the past favored the adoption of a system of in­
      determinate sentences, and there is much to be said for that ap­
                                42

proach as the ultimate solution. However, it would entail the <IIlII\
establishment of new and, perhaps, expensive procedures, and ...""
considerable time might elapse before it could be put into opera­
tion. I commend to you for your earnest consideration the sug­
gestion of making sentences reviewable on appeal, with the pow­
er in the appellate court either to increase or decrease the punish­
ment as the facts of the case might require. It would not, in
my opinion, add materially to the ,york of the courts, for, as the
Solicitor General observed, "the existence of the power (of re­
view) would make its exercise unnecessary in all but a few cases."
   5. Attorney General's Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws.­
A development which may result in easing the burden on court
calendars is the study now being made by my Antitrust Com­
mittee. There are at least three major areas in which it is antici­
pated that the Report will make useful recommendations directly
affecting this complex and often lengthy litigation.
   First, the group aims, through its review of statute and case
law, to clarify antitrust doctrines and thus suggest positive guides
for businessmen. By so doing, it is hoped that unwitting viola­
tions and resulting trials will be cut down.
   Second, this STOUp is concerned with procedures for speeding     0
the progress of antitrust litigation by suggesting means for coun­
sel to aid the court in sharpening issues for trial and shortening
litigation. A limitation on the period of relevant inquiry is but
one of the many possible means under study.
   Finally, the work may in some measure respond to the de­
mands of at least a few district judges for some coherent relation
between the legal and economic concepts of antitrust by attempt­
ing to relate these two disciplines to antitrust problems. Bring­
ing together these two bodies of learning may facilitate the court's
handling of antitrust litigation in determining violations and in
the preparation of proper orders and decrees.
   A tentative final draft of the Committee Report was presented
to all members of the Committee in mid-August. That draft is
now being revised and a modified report will be presented to the
next full Committee meeting in November. The Committee's
goal is to complete its Report before the end of the year.
   6. Federal Youth Corrections Act.-It is always a pleasure to be
able to report results. I have that pleasure now.                     ~
   In February of this year, Mr. James V. Bennett, the able Director ..J
of the Bureau of Prisons, certified the availability of facilities at
                                           43 

 ~ Ashland, Kentucky, thus enabling us to put into effect, for the
....,I Eastern half of the United States, the 10I}g awaited program for
       special custody, training, treatment, and supervised release of Fed­
       eral juvenile offenders. That program, as you know, is the out­
       growth of splendid planning and hard work by the American Law
       Institute and this Judicial Conference. The first commitment to
       Ashland was made shortly after Mr. Bennett's certification in
       February, and as of September 10, 1954,31 of the 51 districts where
       the Act applies have availed themselves of its provisions. One
       hundred and fifty-eight youthful offenders have been committed
       under its terms. I am confident that this program, designed to
       salvage and rehabilitate youngsters who violate Federal laws, will
       pay ever increasing dividends in human beings capable of assuming
       positions of confidence and trust in society.
         7. The President's Conference on Administrative Procedure.­
       Judge Prettyman, in his address to the American Bar Association
       in August of 1953, described, in terms which bear repeating, the
       origin of this important Conference. He said:
         In the year 1949 the subject came to the attention of the Judicial Conference
       of the United States. .As is the established custom in these matters, the Con­
~ ference appointed a Committee, the Committee suggested an Advisory Com­
..",., mittee, the Advisory Committee reported to the Committee, the Committee re­
       ported to the Conference, and the Conference recommended that the President of
       the United States call a Conference. He did so.

       You will remember that President Eisenhower called upon the
    Attorney General on April 29, 1953, to implement this recom­
    mendation, and that thereafter invitations were extended to 56
    departments and agencies having adjudicatory and rulemaking
    functions. In audition, members of the Federal judiciary, Federal
    trial examiners, and a number of prominent members of the Bar
    were invited to participate in the Conference.
       You will also recall that on November 23, 1953, the Conference
    issued its first Report in which it recommended to the President the
    establishment of an Office of Administrative Procedure, to the
    Judicial Conference that uniform rules be established to govern
    the review of administrative proceedings, and to the several in­
    terested agencies, 16 specific suggestions aimed at eliminating de­
    lays, undue expenses, and voluminous records. Many of these
    recommendations have already been put into effect and others are
-. now reaching the stage where they will shortly be ready for
.,. adoption.
                                        44 

   One of these matters now approaching the stage of final action is
a legislative proposal to permit the transmission of an abbreviated ~
record upon review and enforcement of agency orders by the courts
of appeal. In commenting on this recommendation, the Presi­
dent's Conference Report said:
  Although the flling of an abbreviated record is permitted by certain statutes
governing particular agencies (citations), other statutes are silent in this con­
nection (citations). while still others expressly preclude any procedure for filing
an abbreviated record (citation). Accordingly, it appears that implementing
legislative amendments to the various statutes will be necessary ......
Legislation to accomplish this purpose has now been prepared by
the President's Conference, and by the Committee on Revision of
the Laws of the Judicial Conference of the United States. Judge
Maris, Chairman of the Committee on Revision of the Laws, re­
quested my views on the bill drafted by that Committee. ::VIy sug­
gestions were all of a technical nature, and in my letter to him of
March 8, 1954, I gave my support to the proposal "as a laudablA
effort to eliminate unnecessary expenditures in time and money in
the review of agency orders by the courts of appeal." I hope legis­
lation of this sort will be introduced and favorably acted on by the
next session of Congress.
   At its plenary sessions in October, the President's Conference              0110
Administrative Procedure will take up two subjects of great im­
portance; the question of the status of hearing officers and the
desirability of adopting uniform rules of practice in administrative
agencies. With respect to this latter subject, I received just yester­
day copies of the Recommendations and Report of the Committee
on Uniform Rules. As you know, this study resulted, in part, from
my recommendation that the question be thoroughly examined.
While I have not yet had the opportunity to fully consider the
Report or the Recommendations, I was most pleased that the
Committee has concluded that, in at least nine areas such as com­
putation of time, service of process, subpenas, official notice, and
presumptions, uniformity is both feasible and desirable. The Com­
mittee concludes its Report on this note of caution:
   No matter how uniform rules are formulated and put into effect, three prac­
tical principles should be kept in mind: (1) the formulation of such rules must
be preceded by thorough sPade work; (2) they must be eVOlved in close coopera­
tion with the agencies and the bar; (3) there must be provision for continuous
study and revision, such as we have for the Rules of Civil Procedure, rather
than a one-shot operation.                                                      ~

                                                                                      .J
                                45 


   I know that this Conference will be keenly interested in this Re­
 port. You may wish to consider at this meeting the desirability of
 establishing a body, such as an Office of Administrative Procedure,
 to provide the continuing review of these rules which will be so
 essential.
   In closing this report I would like to express the thanks of Gen­
 eral Swing, our Immigration Commissioner, and myself for the
 cooperation and assistance of the Chief Justice, the personnel in
 the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the many Federal
 judges and clerks in preparing for the Special Naturalization Cere­
 monies to take place on Veterans' Day, November 11, when it is
 conservatively estimated that over 50,000 persons will become cit­
 izens of the United States.
