             ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS RECOMMENDED

  The Conference was informed that the Judicial Council of the
Ninth Circuit is now of the opinion that the business of the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit can be handled without the appoint­
ment of additional circuit judges at this time. Accordingly the
Conference voted to withdraw the recommendation heretofore
made for the creation of three additional judgeships, two permanent
and one temporary for that circuit.
  Upon consideration of the state of the dockets and needs of the
courts in the various circuits the Conference recommended the
creation of the following additional judgeships not heretofore
recommended by the Conference:
     1 additional circuit judgeship for the Second Circuit.
                                                                        -

     1 additional district judgeship for the District of Connecticut.
     1 additional district judgeship for the Middle District of
       Pennsylvania on a temporary basis.
     1 additional district judgeship for the Northern District of
       Texas.
     1 additional district judgeship for the Eastern District of
       Michigan.
     1 additional district judgeship for the District of Arizona.
     1 additional district judgeship for the District of Colorado.
   The Conference confirmed its recommendation heretofore made
upon a mail vote of one additional district judgeship for the East­
ern District of New York.
   A complete list of the present Judicial Conference recommenda­
tions with respect to judgeships including former recommenda­
tions not yet enacted, which the nmference voted to reaffirm, is
as follows:
                                                                        -

division in the Northern District of California to be composed of
Alameda and Contra Costa Counties (S. 864; H. J. Res. 126; H. J.
lles.160; and H. J. Res. 235) be not enacted.
ApPOINTMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL JUDGE WHEN A DISABLED JUDGE
                         FAILS TO RETIRE

  The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation made at the April
1954 special session (Cf. Rep. p. 3) and again at the September
1954 session (Cf. Rep. p. 7) that the repealed statute which per­
mitted the President to appoint an additional judge when a dis­        t'"
sbled judge eligible to retire failed to do so and the President       -
found that such an appointment was necessary for the efficient
dispatch of business, be amended in the form recommended by the
Conference and reenacted. The recommendation of the Confer­
ence is embodied in H. R. 4792 which is pending before the Judiciary
Committee of the House of Representatives.
PROPOSED DESIGNATION OF RETIRED JUDGES As "SENIOR JUDGES"

   The Committee on Retirement of Judges reported that in com­
pliance with the direction of the Conference it had circulated among
the judges for an expression of views the recommendations con­
tained in its report submitted to the Conference at the September
1954 session (Cf. Rep. p. 8). These recommendations proposed
that § 371 (b) of Title 28, United States Code, be amended so as
to designate a judge taking advantage of the retirement provisions
as a "senior judge" instead of a "retired judge" as at present and
that a roster to be known as the "Roster of Senior Judges" be main­
tained by the Chief Justice of retired judges willing and able to
undertake special judicial duties upon assignment by him when
and as needed. The judges who replied to the request of the Com­
                                          5

      mittee for an expression of views almost unanimously favored the
_	    proposals. The Conference approved the report of the Committee
      and directed that the draft of bill prepared by it be recommended
      to Congress for enactment.

      REPRESENTATION OF SPECIAL COURTS AND DISTRICT COURTS ON THE
                              JUDICIAL CONFERENCE

            The Conference approved a proposal that the Chief Justice be
         authorized to designate the Chief Judge of the Court of Claims or
         the Chief Judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to sit
         as an equal member of the Conference to represent the special
         courts and recommended that the budget estimates of those courts
         should be made subject to the approval of the Judicial Conference
         in the same way that the budget estimates for the Courts of Ap­
         peals and District Courts are now required by § 605 of Title 28,
         United States Code, to be so approved.
            A bill now pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee (S.
         977) would authorize judges of the Court of Claims to be designated
         by the Chief Justice to serve as circuit or district judges and author­
  ,... 	 ize the Chief Judge of the Court of Claims to participate as a mem­
....., ber of the Judicial Conference. This bill was approved in principle
         with amendments to carry out the recommendation of the Con­
         ference.
            Judge Goodman submitted to the Conference a recommendation
         of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit that provision be
         made for representation of district judges on the Judicial Conference
         or that a committee be directed to consider the matter. The Con­
         ference referred this recommendation to the Committee hereinafter
         referred to which was authorized to be appointed by the Chief Jus­
         tice to study the functioning of the district courts and courts of
         appeals, their supporting personnel and court administration.
                    COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINIS'rRATION

         The Conference discussed its serious concern over the inability
      of the courts in many districts as presently constituted, particu­
      larly in metropolitan areas, to keep up with the rising tide of
      judicial business and the consequent accumulation of arrearages
      and long delays to litigants in reaching trial. As pointed out in
      the repbrt of the September 1954 session of the Conference, while
      the number of judgeships in the district courts has increased by
                                 6
27 percent since 1941, during the same period there has been an        ~
increase of 55 percent in the number of all civil cases commenced      _
annually, with an 80 percent increase in the number of new private
civil cases which take much the largest part of the judges' time.
The courts cannot control their intake, but must take the cases as
they come to them. The Conference concluded that it should
undertake a broad survey of the requirements of the courts with
respect to manpower and administration properly to discharge
their responsibilities in the light of present and prospective con­
ditions. Accordingly, the following resolution was adopted:
          Resolved, That a Committee of district and circuit judges
        be appointed to study the functioning of the District Courts
        and Courts of Appeals and their supporting personnel and
        their court administration.
   In the discussion of this subject, concern was expressed over the
fact that in some metropolitan districts where there are now long
delays in reaching trial, the number of court sessions during the
summer for the trial of civil cases is limited. This matter was
referred to the above Committee for its consideration.
   The Director brought to the attention of the Conference criti-      I'"
cal comments on the judicial councils and judicial conferences of      -­
the circuits in the Federal judicial system, contained in a memo­
randum prepared by Professor Maynard E. Pirsig of the Law School
of the University of Minnesota, as a part of the Survey of the Le­
gal Profession under the auspices of the American Bar Associa­
tion. The matter was referred to the same Committee.

            SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS

   Chief Judge Biggs, Chairman of the Committee on Supporting
Personnel, submitted the report of that Committee.
   The Committee had considered a resolution of the Judicial Con­
ference of the Ninth Circuit proposing that legislation be enacted
concerning the retirement of secretaries of federal judges similar
to that enacted in relation to employees of the legislative branch
by Public Law 303, approved March 6, 1954 (Cf. Rep. Sept.
1954, p. 9). It was of the opinion that secretaries of judges ought
not to be treated with respect to retirement on a more advantageous
basis than other employees of the judicial branch, but that all
should be treated alike as to retirement privileges and benefits.
                                          7

        The Committee had considered and recommended the approval of
        S. 1153 of the 84th Congress which would amend the Civil Service
        Retirement Act so as to liberalize its provisions in a number of
        respects, including the computation of annuities on a basis of
        21;2 percent of highest average salary multiplied by years of serv­
        ice instead of 11;2 percent as at present. The bill also contains pro­
        visions requiring mandatory retirements at age 70 after 15 years of
        service or at the conclusion of 15 years of service if then beyond the
        age of 70 subject to exemption by the President in individual cases,
        which would be applicable to employees in the judicial branch as
        well as to those in the executive branch. Under existing law
        these provisions are applicable to personnel in the executive branch
        but not in the judicial branch. The Committee expressed the view
        that such automatic separation would be in the best interests of
        efficient administration of the judicial establishment and did not
        recommend that judicial employees be excluded from this provision
        of the bill. The Conference approved the report of the Committee
        and recommended to Congress the enactment of S. 1153.
           The Committee also reported that it had considered a recommen­
/"" 	   dation made by the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit that
        the grades in which secretaries to judges may be classified be en­
        larged from the present maximum of grade GS-8 so as to include
        grades GS-9 through GS-12 (Cf. Rep. Sept. Sess. 1954, pp. 9, 10).
        It desired to inform itself further as to the existing rates of pay of
        secretaries in law offices in representative localities of the United
        States and had requested the Administrative Office to make an
        investigation of the subject and report its findings to the Commit­
         tee. Accordingly the Committee asked and was granted leave of
        the Conference to consider this matter further.
           The Conference was informed that at the request of Chief Judge
        Hutcheson the Committee had considered the status under the Fed­
        eral Employees' Group Life Insurance Act of 1954, Public Law 598
        of the S3d Congress, approved August 17, 1954, of .Mr. Oakley F.
        Dodd, the former clerk of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir­
         cuit. Mr. Dodd retired at the close of business on July 31, 1954,
         after more than fifty years of faithful service to the court approxi­
        mately two weeks before the enactment of the law without know­
        ing that legislation of this character was pending in Congress.
        Consequently he was excluded from the coverage of the Act. If he
        had been informed that the bill was pending in Congress and likely
                                  8

to be enacted, he would have delayed his retirement with the entire
approval of the court and received its benefits. The Committee
was of the opinion that the only way by which this situation could
                                                                           -
be rectified would be by the passage of a private bill authorizing the
extension to Mr. Dodd of the benefits of the insurance act.
   Chief Judge Parker called the attention of the Conference to the
fact that the clerk of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,
Mr. Claude M. Dean, who retired at the close of business June 30,
1954, also after service to the court of more than fifty years is in a
similar situation to that of Mr. Dodd.
   The Conference voted to recommend the passage of appropriate
special legislation to extend the benefits of Public Law 598, 83d
Congress, to Mr. Dodd and Mr. Dean and instructed the Admin­
istrative Office to transmit the recommendation to the Congress.
   Another matter referred to the Committee at the Sepember 1954
session of the Conference was a proposal by the Administrative
Assistant Attorney General that the fees of bailiffs employed
temporarily to assist criers in the district courts under § 755 of Title
 28, United States Code, and the fees of witnesses for indigent liti­
gants when payable by the Government be provided for in the ap­
propriations for the courts instead of those for the Department
of Justice as at present (Cf. Rep. p. 10). The Committee reported
                                                                           ­
that it had reached the conclusion that it would be appropriate
and administratively sound to transfer the power of employing
bailiffs from the marshals to the district judges in whose courts
 they are to serve and to provide that bailiffs so employed be specifi­
cally vested with the powers of a deputy United States marshal in
 the performance of their duties. This will require amendment of
 Title 28, United States Code, and in the event of such an amend­
 ment the transfer of appropriations for the compensation of bailiffs
 from the Department of Justice to the court appropriations would
 follow automatically. The Committee recommended a draft of a
 bill to accomplish the purpose by amendments to §§ 604 and 755 of
 Title 28, United States Code. The recommendation of the Com­
  mittee was approved by the Conference and the draft of bill di­
 rected to be transmitted to the Congress with a recommendation
 that it be enacted.
    The Committee reported that representatives of the Department
 of Justice conferring with the Committee had not pressed the pro­
  posal with respect to the fees of witnesses for indigent litigants and
                                       9

had stated that the occasion for it had passed. The Committee
accordingly had given no further consideration to this proposaL
   The Committee informed the Conference that it had considered
a request by Chief Judge Stephens for authorization for additional
personnel for the office of the clerk of the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which had been re­
ferred to it at the April 1954 session of the Conference (CL Rep.
p. 8). I t had heard Judge Danaher in support of the recommenda­
tions and had before it a report of the Administrative Office with
respect to the needs of the court. The Committee recommended
a modification of the request so as to authorize the addition of one
deputy clerk in grade GS-8 to assume the duties of a courtroom
deputy thereby releasing the present courtroom deputy for more
important duties, and the establishment of a pool of three stenog­
raphers in grade GS-5 to fill the need for additional stenographic
service for the circuit judges and the clerk's office. * The Con­
ference approved the recommendation of the Committee.
   A recommendation submitted by Chief Judge Duffy concerning
the need for strengthening the Probation Service with regard to
numbers and salaries of Probation Officers, and additional funds for
the Federal Probation Service Training Center at Chicago, was re­
ferred to the Committee on Supporting Personnel for consideration
and report to the Conference.

INCLUSION OF PERSONNEL OF THE COURTS IN PENDING LEGISLATION
  FOR PAY INCREASES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER ALLOWANCES
  FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES GENERALLY

  The Director reported to the Conference on steps which he has
taken to assure the inclusion of the supporting personnel of the
courts in pending legislation for pay increases on a parity with em­
ployees in the executive branch of the Government and a cor­
responding increase in the statutory ceiling upon the salaries of
court reporters. The Conference approved the action taken by the
Director in this connection.
  The Conference was also informed by the Director of pending
proposals to increase the allowances for travel and maintenance ex­
penses, also the use of privately owned automobiles, incurred in
  '",Chief Judge Stephens, a member of the Committee, expressed no view with
respeet to the recommendation concerning additional personnel for the court of
which he is Chief Judge, considering it proper that he should disqualify bimself.
                                  10 

official travel and to relieve Government employees who are re­
quired to give fidelity bonds of the cost of the premiums of such
bonds. The Conference is of the view that the supporting person­
                                                                          -­
nel of the courts should be included in any legislation of this charac­
ter which may be enacted for the benefit of Government employees
generally.
SALARIES OF CERTAIN OFFICERS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF
                    THE UNITED STATES CoURTS

  The Conference voted to go on record in favor of substantial in­
creases in the salaries of the Director, Assistant Director and the
four heads of divisions of the Administrative Office. It suggested
salaries of $22,500 for the Director, $20,000 for the Assistant Di­
rector, and $18,500 for the heads of each of the four divisions,
namely the Division of Procedural Studies and Statistics, the Di­
vision of Business Administration, the Bankruptcy Division, and
the Probation Division and referred the matter to the Committees
on Supporting Personnel and Revision of the Laws to prepare and
submit to Congress appropriate recommendations in this behalf for
the Conference.
                  BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRA'I'ION

   Chief Judge Phillips, chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy
Administration, reported that the Committee had met and con­
sidered the recommendations contained in the report of the Bank­
ruptcy Division of the Administrative Office which was approved
by the Director on February 18, 1955, relating to the positions of
l'eterees 111 bankruptcy to become vacant by expiration of term
on June 30, 1955, unless a later expiration date is noted, and
changes in salaries and arrangements.
   The report of February 18, 1955, was submitted by the Director
to the members of the Judicial Conference and to the judicial coun­
cils and the district judges of the circuits and districts concerned,
with the request that the district judges advise the judicial councils
of their respective circuits of their views in respect to the recom­
mendations for their districts, and that the chief judges of the cir­
cuits in turn inform the Administrative Office of the views of the
judicial councils of their circuits. The Director's report together
with the views expressed by the district judges and the circuit
councils was considered by the Committee. The Conference had
before it the Committee's report as well as the recommendations
of the Director, the district judges and the judicial councils.
                                                           11 


  Upon the recommendation of the Committee the Conference
took the action shown in the following table relating to positions
to become vacant by expiration of term on June 30, 1955, unless
otherwise noted, such action to be effective July 1, 1955, unless
a later date is noted:

                          CHANGES IN ARRANGEMENTS

          The following changes in arrangements for referees, to be ef­
        fective July 1, 1955, were recommended by the Committee and
        approved by the Conference.
        Second Circuit:
          District of Connecticut.-That the referees at Hartford and
        Bridgeport be given joint and concurrent jurisdiction throughout
        the district.
          District of V ermont.-That Addison County be transferred from
        the territory of the Referee at Rutland to the territory of the
        Referee at Burlington, and that Washington County be trans­
        ferred from the territory of the Burlington Referee to the terri­
        tory of the Rutland Referee.
        Fifth Circuit:
           Northern District of Alabama.-That an additional part-time
        referee position be created at Tuscaloosa, to serve the Western
        Division of the District comprising the counties of Bibb, Green,
        Pickens, Sumter and Tuscaloosa and in addition the counties of
,..,!   Fayette and Lamar in the Jasper Division; the official headquar­
        ters of the new referee to be at Tuscaloosa with Tuscaloosa desig­
        nated as his regular place of holding court; and that the salary of
        this new position be fixed at $4,000 per annum.
           That the above-mentioned counties be eliminated from the ter­
        ritory of the Birmingham referees, and that Tuscaloosa be elimi­
        nated as a place of holding court for the Birmingham referees.
        Seventh Circuit:
          Northern District of Indiana.- That the territory of the Referee
        at Gary be changed to include the Hammond Division only and
        that the territory of the Referee at Fort Wayne be changed to
        include the Fort Wayne and South Bend Divisions.
          That South Bend be eliminated as a place of holding court for
        the Referee at Gary and added as a place of holding court for the
        Referee at Fort Wayne.
        Eighth Circuit:
          District of Nebraska.-That Hastings, McCook, Chadron and
        Norfolk be discontinued as designated places of holding bank­
        ruptcy court.
                                    14 


Ninth Circuit:
   Southern District of California.-That two additional full-time
                                                                                 --
positions be provided at Los Angeles at salaries of $12,500 a year
to serve the Central Division of the District, except San Bernardino
and Riverside Counties.
   The Committee recommended and the Conference authorized
the Director to seek at the first opportunity a supplemental ap­
propriation for 1956 for referees' salaries in an amount sufficient
to defray the cost of the above changes in salaries and arrange­
ments approved by the Conference.
   Chief Judge Phillips brought to the attention of the Conference
a bill (H. R. 4791) to amend Section 40a of the Bankruptcy Act
so as to raise the maximum salaries for full-time referees from
the present amount of $12,500 to $17,500 a year and for part-time
referees from the present amount of $6,000 to $9,000 a year, the
determination of the precise amount of the salaries of both full­
time and part-time referees to remain in the Judicial Conference
as at present. He reported that after discussion and considera­
tion, the Committee remained divided as to the maximum amount
to be provided for full-time and part-time referees. The Con­
ference recommended that Section 40a of the Bankruptcy Act be
amended so as to authorize maximum salaries to be fixed by the
Conference of $] 5,000 and $7,500 a year for full-time and part-time
referees, respectively.
   The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
action taken at the September 1954 meeting of the Judicial Con­
ference recommending that the following maximum rates of com­
pensation for trustees be provided by amendment of Section 48c
 (1) of the Bankruptcy Act, to wit:
   10 percent on the first $500; 

   6 percent on the next $1,000 ; 

   3 percent on the next $8,500 ; 

   2 percent on the next $15,000; 

   1 percent on all above $25,000 ; 

   together witb an increase in the discrctionary allowance from $100 as now 

   provided in such subsection to the sum of $150. 

The Conference approved the Committee's recommendation.
  The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference a bill,
H. R. 1568, 84th Congress, which would amend the Bankruptcy
Act to provide that receivers and trustees in proceedings under
Chapter XI (arrangements) should be compensated on the same
                                15 

basis as those in proceedings under Chapter X (corporate reor­
ganizations) and pointed out that the Bankruptcy Act at present
provides that the judge or referee may fix the compensation for
such services at an amount not in excess of the compensation al­
lowable to a receiver under the Bankruptcy Act. The Committee
recommended that H. R. 1568, 84th Congress, be disapproved
and the Conference agreed, thereby reaffirming its previous action
with regard to an identical bill, H. R. 4400, introduced in the 83d
Congress.
   The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference a
bill, H. R. 4561, 84th Congress, to amend Section 28 of the Bank­
ruptcy Act relating to the designation of newspapers for the publi­
cation of bankruptcy notices. This bill \vould permit the
designation of newspapers published in the city or county in which
the bankrupt resides for the publication of bankruptcy notices.
 (New language is italicized.) The Committee recommended
the approval of this bill and the Conference agreed.
   The Committee reported that district judges and referees are
finding it very difficult to interpret and apply Section 60 of the
Bankruptcy Act and related sections. The Conference author­
ized the Committee to study these sections with a view to proposing
legislation to clarify their meaning.
                         ApPROPRIATIONS

  The Director informed the Conference that in the Second Sup­
plemental Appropriation Bill, 1955, as reported by the House Ap­
propriations Committee additional funds for salaries of judges,
salaries of supporting personnel, and travel and miscellaneous
expenses were included based on service during the current fiscal
year of 20 of the 30 additional judges authorized by Public Law
294 of the 83d Congress, and that the Committee had given leave
for an application for additional funds to be made if more than
that number of judges should be appointed. He requested and
was given authority to submit to the Congress an estimate to defray
the added costs during 1955 and 1956 of judges' salaries in view
of the el1actment of Public Law 9 of the present Congress.
ANNUITIES FOR VVIDOWS AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN OF JUDGES

  The Conference recommended to the Congress the enactment
of legislation to authorize provision for payment of annuities on
a contributory basis to widows and dependent children of judges
                                 16 


comparable to the provisions made under existing law for annui­
ties to widows and dependent children of Members of Congress.
            COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS

  Judge Maris, Chairman of the Committee on Revision of the
Laws, submitted a report on behalf of the Committee.
        DISQUALIFICATION OF JUDGE FOR BIAS OR PREJL'DICE

   At the September 1954 session of the Conference, the bill, S. 3517,
of the 83d Congress, relating to disqualification of a judge for bias
or prejudice was referred to the Committee for consideration and
also for circulation among the judges for an expression of views
(Cf. Rep. p. 28). In November the Committee made a report
in which it expressed the view that the bill is unwise and its enact­
ment would not be in the public interest. This report was circu­
lated among the judges, and replies were received from 19 circuit
judges and 87 district judges, all of whom were in agreement with
the views of the Committee. The proposed legislation has been re­
introduced in the present Congress as S. 447. The recommendation
of the Committee was adopted, and the Conference recommended
against the enactment of S. 447.
   RECORD ON REVIEW OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

   At the April 1954 special session, the Conference approved the
draft of a proposed bill submitted by the Committee dealing with
the record on review of orders of administrative agencies and its
abbreviation (Cf. Rep. pp. 17, 18). However, the Committee re­
ported that subsequent conferences with the Committee on Ju­
dicial Review of the President's Conference on Administrative
Procedure, and with counsel for the Federal Power Commission,
and also the enactment of two statutes at the last session of Con­
gress, indicated the need of some modifications of the draft bilL
The Committee accordingly had prepared a revised draft which
was annexed to its report and which it recommended.
   The Conference approved the revised draft for recommendation
to Congress for enactment. Besides editorial changes, the follow­
ing are the principal changes in the revised draft: The words "in
its judgment" (referring to the agency) are added to the provision
that when review proceedings have been instituted in two or more
courts with respect to the same order the agency "shall file the
                                     17 

    record in that one of such courts in which the proceedings may be
    carried on with the greatest convenience to all the parties involved"
    and "other courts in which such proceedings are pending shall
    thereupon transfer them to the court of appeals in which the record
    has been filed." This is for the purpose of avoiding dilatory liti­
    gation as to the balance of convenience of the parties, by making
    clear that the choice of forum by the agency should not be review­
    able except possibly for a clear abuse of discretion. Amendments
    to the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act are included
    to make clear that the Federal Power Commission will continue to
    have authority to modify or revoke its orders made under those
    acts after petitions for review have been filed but before the record
    has been filed in court. Under the bill the court of appeals is to
    have jurisdiction from the time of filing the petition and it was
    considered that without such a saving provision the present author­
     ity of the commission to deal with an order in the interim between
    the filing of the petition and the record might be doubtful. A new
    section was added concerning a recent amendment to the Federal
    Food Drug and Cosmetic Act relating to pesticide chemicals, and a
    section dealing with the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 was eliminated
    since that Act has now been superseded by the Atomic Energy Act
    of 1954 under which judicial review of orders of the Atomic Energy
     Commission is had under the provisions of the Hobbs Act of
    December 29, 1950.
        A recommendation by the Judicial Council of the District of
     Columbia Circuit that section 646 (d) of Title 49 of the United
    States Code relating to Air Carriers, and the Hobbs Act approved
    December 29,1950 (64 Stat. 1129,1131) be amended so as to elimi­
     nate the requirement that 5 days' notice be given before interlocu­
     tory relief may be granted was referred to the Committee at the
     April 1954 session of the Conference (Cf. Rep. p. 19). The Com­
     mittee reported that it was of the view that the purpose could best
     be accomplished by the substitution of a requirement for "reason­
     able notice" in lieu of the fixed provision for 5 days' notice, and
     submitted the draft of a bill to this end. The Conference approved
     the report and voted to recommend the proposed bill to Congress
     for enactment.
        A bill (S. 489) entitled "A Bill To provide general rules of prac­
     tice and procedure before federal agencies" introduced in the pres­

-    ent Congress was referred to the Committee for consideration.

                 COMMITTEE ON HABEAS CORPUS

   Chief Judge Parker, Chairman of the Committee on Habeas Cor­
pus, reported that pursuant to the direction of the Conference at
the September 1954 session (Cf. Rep. pp. 22, 23) the report of the
Committee made to that session, together with a copy of the amend­
ment which it proposed to § 2254 of Title 28, United States Code,
relating to applications for habeas corpus by persons imprisoned
under sentences of State courts had been circulated among the
circuit and district judges for an expression of views. A large
number of judges replied expressing unqualified approval of the
proposed amendment. Only one judge expressed disapproval of
the entire proposal and one expressed doubt as to the second para­
graph. The Conference approved the report of the Committee and
directed that the draft of bill be recommended to the Congress for
enactment.

REPOHT OF THE COMMITIEE ON REVIEW OF ORDERS OF THE INTER­
  STATE COMMERCE COMMISSION AND CERTAIK OTHER ADMIN­
  ISTRATIVE ORDERS

   Chief Judge Phillips, Chairman, made a report of the Commit­
tee on Review of Orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission
and Certain Other Administrative Orders on a proposed amend­
ment of rules governing the review of enforcement of orders of
administrative agencies, boards, commissions and officers.
   Title 5, United States Code, § 1041, which was based on a draft
bill approved by the Judicial Conference, provides:
      "The several courts of appeals shall adopt and promulgate
    rules governing the practice and procedure, including prehear­
    ing conference procedure, in proceedings to review orders under
    this chapter: Provided, however, That such rules shall be ap­
    proved by the Judicial Conference of the United States."
  Rules based upon a recommendation of the Committee have now
been adopted by the several courts of appeals pursuant to this pro­
vision. The Committee recommended an amendment to the rules
in alternative forms for the purpose of alleviating the burden now
imposed by certain statutes dealing with enforcement and review
of administrative orders which provide that the entire record be­
fore the agency shall be filed in the reviewing court. This is some­
times a burdensome requirement because of the size and character
                                      19 


    of the records made before administrative agencies. Under the
    proposed amendment, the agency in lieu of actually transmitting
    the entire transcript to the clerk of the court of appeals would file
    with the clerk a certified list of all the documents, transcripts, and
    other material comprising the record which would be held by the
    ('ustodian subject to the orders of the clerk of the court of appeals
    to be transmitted in whole or part to him when and if required by
    the court for its use in the review proceeding. The filing of a cer­
    tified list of the material in the record and the holding of such ma­
    terial for and subject to the directions of the clerk would be deemed
    to be the full equivalent of the filing of the entire transcript of the
    record in the court. In circuits in which the appendix system is not
    used, and the portions of the record designated by the parties are
    printed by the court of appeals under the supervision of the clerk,
    it will be necessary for the clerk actually to have in his possession
    the parts of the record which are to be printed and in its alternative
    form the amendment provides for the delivery of those parts to him.
       The Conference directed that the report of the Committee be cir­
    culated among the chief judges of the courts of appeals for con­
-   sideration and such action as their courts consider appropriate.
    Also a motion was made and agreed to that the Conference approve
    any rule heretofore adopted or which may hereafter be adopted by
    any of the courts of appeals in either of the two alternative forms
    recommended by the Committee and included in its report, includ­
    ing a rule submitted for approval by the Court of Appeals of the
    Third Circuit at this session.

      DISPOSITION OF OLD RECORDS OF COURTS OF ApPEALS NOT OF
                             PERMANENT VALUE

      The Committee appointed at the April 1954 session to consider
    a proposed schedule for the disposal of noncurrent records of the
    courts of appeals (Cf. Rep. p. 16) which made an interim report
    at the September 1954 session (Cf. Rep. p. 32) submitted its final
    report. Pursuant to suggestions made by the Committee, the Ad­
    ministrator of General Services prepared a revised disposal schedule
    which the Committee approved. The Committee recommended
    that the Judicial Conference consent to the submission of the re­
    vised schedule to the Congress pursuant to Title 44, United States


-   Code, § § 366-380. It was pointed out that the schedule will merely
    authorize the destruction of the listed records but is not mandatory.
                                20
The report of the Committee was approved and the Committee             """"
discharged with the thanks of the Conference.

            AIR CONDITIONING OF COURT QUARTERS

   Chief Judge Parker, Chairman of the Committee on Air Con­
ditioning of Court Quarters, which was authorized to be appointed
at the September 1954 session of the Conference (Cf. Rep. p. 30)
informed the Conference that he had sent a letter to all circuit
and district judges asking for information with regard to the need
for air conditioning in their respective circuits and districts. He
had asked each judge to send a copy of his reply to the chief judge
of his circuit as the Committee was asking the Judicial Council
of each circuit to pass upon the needs of the circuit and indicate
the places of greatest need for the information of the Committee.
He requested the members of the Conference to furnish the Com­
mittee the reports of their Councils before the date of the Com­
mittee meeting which is scheduled for May 16.
   The members of this Committee appointed by the Chief Jus­
tice are as follows: Chief Judge John J. Parker, Chairman, Cir­
cuit Judge Elbert Parr Tuttle, and District Judges Marion S.          ",....,
Boyd, Roy W. Harper, and Casper Platt.                                 .___

       DISAPPROVAL OF PROPOSED ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

   The attention of the Conference was called to S. 488 entitled
"A Bill To improve the administration of justice by the creation
of an Administrative Court of the United States" which is pending
before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. This bill is simi­
lar to a proposal introduced in the 81st Congress which the Con­
ference after careful consideration by a committee disapproved at
the September 1949 session (Cf. Rep. p. 20). The Conference
voted to recommend against the enactment of S. 488.

PROPOSAL OF THE CANAL ZONE GOVERNMENT            To BE   RELIEVED
  OF FUNCTIONS IN RELATION TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
  CANAL ZONE AND    To ABOLISH   CERTAIN RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES
  OF PERSONNEL OF THE COURT

  The Director informed the Conference of a proposal by the
Canal Zone Government of legislation which would transfer to
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts the respon­
                                      21 


      sibility for various facilities now provided by that Government for
      the United States District Court for the District of the Canal
      Zone and its personnel and would terminate certain privileges
      now enjoyed by the personnel of the court in common with person­
      nel of the Canal Zone Government. The proposal was disap­
      proved by the Conference.
                             INDIGENT LITIGANTS

         The Director informed the Conference that hearings had been
      scheduled before a Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee of
      the House of Representatives on proposed legislation recommended
      by the Conference to provide for the appointment of public de­
      fenders by district courts which desired or in the alternative the
      allowance of compensation to counsel appointed to represent poor
      persons accused of crime in individual cases under specified condi­
      tions (Cf. Rep. Sept. sess. 1954, p. 31). He stated that counsel
      for the Subcommittee before which the hearing would be held, had
      suggested an amendment by way of addition to the bill to make
      clear that the measure would not impair the present power of the
      courts to appoint counsel for poor persons on a voluntary basis .
..J      The Conference renewed its approval of the type of legislation
      previously recommended and indicated that it would concur in
      the suggested amendment.
                   JURISDICTION OF THE DISTRICT COURTS

        The attention of the Conference was called to bills (H. R. 91,
      H. R. 5007) introduced in the present Congress affecting the juris­
      dictional amount in Federal question and diversity of citizenship
      cases. The Conference reaffirmed its recommendation (Cf. Rep.
      Sept. 1952 sess. p. 15) that legislation be enacted to amend §§ 1331
      and 1332 of Title 28, United States Code, so as to fix the juris­
      dictional amount in Federal question and diversity of citizenship
      cases at $10,000, and further to amend § 1332 so as to provide that
      in cases based upon diversity of citizenship a corporation shall be
      deemed to be a citizen both of the State of its creation and the
      State in which it has its principal place of business.
                   JURY TRIAL IN CONDEMNATION CASES

        Bills (H. R. 4732, H. R. 4777) have been reintroduced in the
__    present Congress to provide that notwithstanding subdivision (h)
                                 22 

of Rule 71A of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the defendant
in a condemnation case may have a jury trial of the issue of just
compensation by filing a demand therefor. The Conference after
the appointment of a committee and careful consideration of its
report has several times expressed its view that legislation of
this character ought not be enacted (Cf. Rep. March 1952 sess.
pp. 7-8; Sept. 1952 sess. p. 15; April 1954 sess. p. 15). The
Conference again expressed the opinion that the present procedure
in condemnation proceedings prescribed by Rule 71A (h) should
be permitted to continue and disapproved the pending bills.

  TRANSFER OF CASES BY THE DISTRICT COURTS AND THE COURT
                            OF CLAIMS

  The Conference reaffirmed its endorsement of the legislation
contained in H. R. 668 of the present Congress entitled "A Bill To
amend title 28 of the United States Code to provide for transfer of
cases between the district courts and the Court of Claims" which is
identical with II. R. 9346 of the 83d Congress approved by the
Conference at the September 1954 session (Cf. Rep. p. 33).

   STATUS OF COURT OF CUSTOMS AND PATENT ApPEALS AND
                         CUSTOMS COURT
                                                                       -
   Upon consideration of a report of the Committee on Revision
of the Laws the Conference at the September 1954 session (Cf.
Rep. pp. 27-28) expressing no view with regard to their constitu­
tionality, approved bills introduced in the 83d Congress which
would declare the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the
Customs Court to be established under Article III of the Constitu­
tion and provide for the temporary assignment of judges from
other courts to those courts and from those courts to other courts.
Similar bills with reference to the Customs Court have been intro­
duced in the present Congress as S. 584 and H. R. 4940. The Con­
ference reaffirmed the position taken at the September 1954 session
with regard to this proposed legislation.

      PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT

   At the September 1954 session, the Conference went on record
in opposition to a proposal that the Taft-Hartley Act be amended
so as to provide that complaints of unfair labor practices be prose­
                                       23 

     cuted directly in the United States District Courts by the com­
     plainant or the United States attorney instead of being handled as
     they now are by examiners of the National Labor Relations Board
     (Cf. Rep. p. 33). This proposal is contained in a bill (H. R. 5087)
     introduced in the present Congress. The Conference renewed its
     opposition to the proposed legislation.

     PROPOSAL To INCREASE FROM          $1,000   TO   $3,000   THE MAXIMUM
        AMOUN'l' INVOLVED IN CASES ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSFER FROM THE
       DISTRICT COURT TO THE J.\;IUNICIPAL COURT OF THE DISTRICT
       OF COLUMBIA

           The Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit
         favors the enactment of legislation to amend the first sentence of
         paragraph (a) of Section 756 of Title 11 of the District of Columbia
         Code, 1951 ed. (paragraph (a) of Section 5 of the Act of April 1,
         1942, c. 207, 56 Stat. 193), so as to raise the maximum amount
         involved in cases eligible for transfer from the District Court to
         the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia from $1,000 to
         $3,000.
           It is believed that the enactment of legislation of this character
...,,# 	 would relieve the burden of the United States District Court by
         permitting the transfer to the Municipal Court for the District of
          Columbia of a substantial volume of cases for the recovery of money
         involving relatively small amounts. The Conference endorsed the
         recommendation.
                   COMMITTEE ON PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME

       The following additional matters were referred to the CommiUee
     on Punishment for Crime which was authorized to be reconstituted
     at the September 1954 session (Cf. Rep. p. 29) for the purpose of
     considering proposals that criminal sentences be made reviewable
     on appeal with power in the appellate court to increase or decrease
     the punishment and that the right to bail for defendants charged
     with crimes of a subversive nature be restricted:
        1. At the instance of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit
     the subject of the need or lack of it of additional legislation by Con­
     gress or, by amendment of the rules, on the matter of civil and
     criminal contempt.
        2. Bills introduced in the present Congress to provide for man­
_    datory penalties in criminal cases.
                                 24
                COMMITTEE ON CIVIL DISABILITIES

   Chief Judge Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on Civil Dis­
abilities, submitted a report for the Committee consisting of him­
self and Chief Judge Biggs, on a recommendation of the Judicial
Conference of the Ninth Circuit (Cf. Rep. Sept. sess. 1954, p. 29),
that the probation law be amended so as to permit confinement in
jail-type institutions or treatment institutions for a period not
exceeding 6 months in connection with the grant of probation on a
I-count indictment. The Committee was of the opinion that the
objective sought to be attained could be accomplished by amending
Title 18, United States Code, § 3651 by adding a paragraph after
the first paragraph of that section reading as follows:
           "Upon entering a judgment of conviction of any offense
        not punishable by death or life imprisonment, if the maxi­
        mum punishment provided for such offense is more than
        six months, any court having jurisdiction to try offenses
        against the United States, except in the District of Colum­
        bia, when satisfied that the ends of justice and the best
        interest of the public as well as the defendant will be served   __
        thereby, may impose a sentence in excess of six months and
        provide that the defendant be confined in a jail-type insti­
        tution or a treatment institution for a period not exceeding
        six months and that the execution of the remainder of the
         sentence be suspended and the defendant placed on proba­
        tion for such period and upon such terms and conditions as
        the court deems best."
    The Conference directed that the report of the Committee be
 circulated among the circuit and district judges for an expression
of views.
          CONFERENCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE

   Judge Prettyman, Chairman of the Conference on Administra­
tive Procedure called by the President of the lJnited States upon
the recommendation of the Judicial Conference (Cf. Rep. Sept.
1951 sess., pp. 25-26) reported that the Conference had submitted
its report to the President and commented upon some of the prin­
cipal recommendations. The Chief Justice expressed the com­
mendation of the Judicial Conference for the valuable service of
Judge Prettyman as Chairman of the President's Conference.
                                 25 

           CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER ADVISEMENT

   The Administrative Office submitted a report to the Conference
listing, by judge, 25 cases and motions which had been held under
advisement more than 6 months on March 15, 1955. Where nec­
essary, these will be brought to the attention of the circuit council
by the chief judge of the circuit.
   The Conference declared a recess, subject to the call of the
Chief Justice.
   For the Judicial Conference of the United States.
