  The Judicial Conference of the United States convened in a

and continued in session 2 days. The Chief Justice presided and
members of the Conference were present as follows:

    Tenth______________________________________ Chief Judge Sam G. Bratton.

  The Conference welcomed the new chief judge for the Tenth

the following resolution:
        WHEREAS, Hon. Orie Leon Phillips retired on January 1,
     1956 from regular active service as a Circuit Judge of the
     Tenth Circuit, after more than 32 years of superb judicial
     service, first as United States District Judge for the District
     of New Mexico, and later as a member of the Court of Ap­
     peals for the Tenth Circuit, and
        WHEREAS, during the past 15 years, as Chief Judge of the
     Tenth Circuit, he has been a member of the Judicial Confer­
     ence of the United States, and in that capacity has contributed

     wisdom, a hard-driving energy, an invaluable service as mem­
                                     (1)
                                 2


      ber of innumerable committees of the Conference, far beyond
     the call of duty, including particularly his service as chairman
      of the Bankruptcy Committee of the Conference, and as chair­
     man of the Subcommittee on Treatment of Youthful Offenders
      of our Conference Committee on Punishment for Crime in
     which capacity he earned a major share of the credit for the
     enactment of the Federal Youth Corrections Act (64 Stat.
      1085),
        RESOLVED, that we now put on record our appreciation
      to Chief Judge Phillips for his dependable help to the Con­
      ference over the years, our warm personal affection for him,
      our delight that he has agreed, though now retired from formal
     membership on this Conference, to continue to serve as chair­
      man of our Bankruptcy Committee and as a member of our
      Committee on Court Administration, and our fond hope and
      expectation that he will find in his qualified retirement an
      abundance of joy and satisfaction.
   The Attorney General, Herbert Brownell, Jr., accompanied by
the Deputy Attorney General, William P. Rogers, and the Solicitor
General, Simon E. Sobeloff, attended the morning session on the
first day of the Conference. The Attorney General made an
informal report to the Conference.

JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORTING
  PERSONNEL AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT
  ADMINISTRATION
  Chief Judge Biggs, who is chairman of the Committee on Sup­
porting Personnel and also chairman of the Committee on C;Ourt
                                 3

Administration, made a joint report for the two cOlmnittees as
was done at the September 1955 session of the Conference (Jud.
Cf. Rpt. p. 9). He informed the Conference that a meeting of the
Committee on Court Administration had been held on November
1 and 2, 1955, and that a joint meeting of the Committee on Sup­
porting Personnel and the Committee on Court Administration
had been held on February 23, 24, and 25, 1956. The Conference
considered the report and acted upon the recommendations as
indicated below. The actions which will require substantial
additional money cannot, of course, become effective until the
necessary funds are appropriated by Congress. The amounts re­
quired will be included in the estimates for the regular judicial
appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1958, effective July 1, 1957.

              CLERKS OF COURT AND THEIR STAFFS

   The committees had heard representatives of the Federal Court
Clerks' Association who presented several recommendations re­
lating to clerks of court and their staffs. The first recommenda­
tion was that the title of the clerk of the court be changed to Hcourt
administrator." After consideration it had been unanimously
resolved by both committees to recommend to the Conference that
there be no change in the title of clerks of court at this time. The
Conference adopted the recommendation.
   The Clerks' Association also recommended that the duties of
disbursing officer in the several districts now discharged by the
United States marshals be transferred to the clerks of court. After
consideration of this proposal it had been resolved by the members
of both committees that it be recommended to the Conference that
no change be made at the present time in respect to the disburse­
ment of funds for the judiciary. The recommendation was
adopted by the Conference.
   The Conference was informed that the Committees had given
careful consideration to recommendations which had been sub­
mitted by the representatives of the Clerks' Association for in­
creases in salaries of clerks to a range from $12,500 to $17,500 per
annum with appropriate increases for their staffs, and also had
considered a report with regard to the classification and salaries of
clerks and their staffs submitted by the Administrative Office. The
 Committees recommended that the salaries of clerks of United
States district courts in large districts be set at $14,000 per annum,
that the Ralaries of clerks in medium districts be set at $12,000
                                  4


per annum, and that the salaries of clerks in small districts be set
at $10,000 per annum. The assignment of the individual dis­
tricts to the various categories would be made by the Administra­
tive Office as at present, subject to review by the Judicial
Conference of the United States if requested by any court, and
for this purpose the Administrative Office would take into account
such factors as the volume of business, the number of judges,
the size of the staff required, and the earnings of the office. The
recommendation was adopted by the Conference.
   It was recommended that the salaries of the clerks of all United
States courts of appeals be set without classification at $12,500
per annum, and this recommendation was also adopted by the
Conference.
   The recommended position descriptions to accompany the re­
port on the classification and salaries of clerks of court and the
personnel of their offices dated February 14, 1956, which had been
prepared by the Administrative Office, were approved by the Con­
ference upon the recommendation of the Committees.
   These descriptions list 37 typical positions in the offices of the
clerks of district courts, setting out the duties performed by the
incumbent and assigning the grade considered appropriate to each
position. They are to be used as guides by the Administrative
Office in classifying positions, with substantial latitude necessarily
allowed that office because of the many variations in the organ­
ization of clerks' offices and the distribution of responsibilities
among their personnel. In general the positions of chief deputy
clerks would be raised two grades, placing chief deputies in large
districts in grade G~13, in medium districts in grade GS-12 and
in small districts in grade GS-IO. A number of the supporting
positions would also be raised in grade including financial deputies,
calendar clerks and courtroom deputies.
   The Administrative Office was directed to examine the grades
and salaries of positions in the offices of the clerks of the courts of
appeals and report to the C;Ommittee on Supporting Personnel.

CLASSIFICATION OF SECRETARIES, LAW CLERKS, LAW CLERK-SECRE­
. TARIES, AND OTHER SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OF THE JUDGES

  The Committees reported that consideration had been given to
the recommendations of a number of the judicial conferences and
judicial councils of the circuits for increases in the compensation
                                           5

    of secretaries to judges and that both committees agreed to submit
    several recommendations to the Conference.
       The first was that 28 U. S. C. 752 be amended to read as follows:
            "Law clerks and secretaries:
                "District judges may appoint necessary law clerks and
                secretaries. "
       This recommendation makes the statutory authorizations for
    law clerks and secretaries for district judges identical with those
    now contained in 28 U. S. C. 712 for circuit judges, and eliminates
    the present requirement for a certificate of necessity by the chief
    judge of his circuit for the appointment of a law clerk by a district
    judge. Also those judges who wished to do so would be enabled
    to have the services of additional employees at lower grades within
    the limitation upon the aggregate salaries of law clerks and sec­
    retaries in place of one law clerk and one secretary at the maximum
    grades. The recommendation was adopted.
       The next recommendation was that two new grades be created
    for judges' secretaries: GS-9 administrative secretary, and GS-lO
    senior administrative secretary; that the present grade GS-4 be

-   abandoned, and that the present grade GS-8 entitled "senior sec­
    retary" be modified so as to eliminate supervisory duties from its
    description. The classifications with the proposed amendments as
    recommended by both committees, showing beginning salaries for
    the different gradeE, are as follows:
    Junior Secretary
    08-5_______________________________________________________________ $3,670
      Minimum Quali(iootions.-At least 1 year's experien(:e as a secretary
    involving duties that demonstrate the ability to take rapid dictation
    and to exercise independent Judgment, and some knowledge of legal
    terminology.


    Associate Secretary
    08-6_______________________________________________________________ $4,080
      Minimum QiUlUflcations.-At least :3 years' experience as a secretary,
    of which at least 2 years should be as a legal secretary involving duties
    that demonstrate the ability to take rapid dictation and a capacity for

   The recommendations were adopted and the requirements for
classification of judges' secretaries in the several grades, as above
described, were approved.
   The Committees recommended appropriate increases in the lim­
itations upon aggregate salaries to be paid to law clerks and secre­
taries employed by a single judge to cover the higher grades for
secretaries. The increase was from $11,360 to $13,485 for judges
other than chief judges of circuits and chief judges of the larger
                                 7

multiple-judge district courts for whom the increase recommended
was from $15,440 to $18,010 per year. The Committees had rec­
ommended that in the case of district judges the larger limitation
be applicable to chief judges of district courts having three or
more judges, but the Conference modified it to apply to chief judges
of district courts having five or more judges as at present. The
recommendation of the Committees as modified by the Conference
was adopted.
   The Committees also recommended that the Conference request
of Congress the elimination in future appropriation acts of the
language relating to classification of secretaries and law clerks and
that in lieu thereof these grades be determined pursuant to a
resolution of the Conference. The recommendation of the com­
mittees was approved and the Conference adopted the following
resolution:
        RESOLVED, That the compensation of secretaries and
     law clerks of circuit and district judges shall be fixed by the
     Director of the Administrative Office of the United 8tates
     Courts without regard to the Classification Act of 1949, ex­
     cept that the salary of a secretary shall conform with that of
     Grade 08-5, G8-6, G8-7, GS-8, G8-9, or G8-1O, as the
     appointing judge shall determine, and the salary of a law
     clerk shall conform with that of Grade G8-5, GS-7, GS-9,
     GS-11, or G8-12, as the appointing judge shall determine,
     subject to review by the jl~dicial council of the circuit if re­
     quested by the Director, such determination by the judge
     otherwise to be final: Provided, that (exclusive of step-in­
     creases conforming with Title VII of the Classification Act
     of 1949 and of compensation paid for temporary assistance
     needed because of an emergency) the aggregate salaries paid
     to secretaries and law clerks appointed by one judge shall
     not exceed $13,485 per annum, except in the case of the chief
     judge of each circuit and the chief judge of each district court
     having five or more district judges in which case the aggregate
     salaries shall not exceed $18,010 per annum.
        "Further resolved that this resolution shall supersede the
     resolution upon the same subject matter adopted by the
     Judicial Conference of the United States at its special meeting
     on November 29,1949."
   The Committee on Court Administration reported that with the
liberalized provisions for secretaries and law clerks recommended
                                 8


 it considered no further action was required with reference to the
 proposal offered by Judge Denman at the September 1955 session
 (Jud. Cf. Rpt. p. 14) and referred to it, that whenever a chief
                                                                        -
 judge of a circuit determines that he needs the services of two law
clerks he be authorized to appoint that number.
    The Conference was informed that after consideration of a sug­
gestion made by Chief Judge Benjamin C. Dawkins, Jr., of the
United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana,
that criers be raised from grade GS-4 to grade GS-5 after 5 years
of service, it had been resolved that the committees recommend
to the Conference that the proposed reclassification be disapproved.
The recommendation was adopted by the Conference. However,
the Conference upon recommendation of the Committees approved
the classification in grade GS-7 of criers who have the qualifica­
tions for assistant law clerk, grade GS-7, as prescribed by the
Conference and who devote substantial time to performing the
duties of law clerk to a judge.
   The Committees recommended that the Conference instruct the
Director of the Administrative Office that, within the appropriate
classifications and salary limitations fixed by the Conference, ap­
proval may be given to the employment of a secretary-law clerk
and law clerk or a secretary-law clerk and secretary by an individual
judge who desires such a combination of employees. The recom­
mendation was adopted.
   The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to provide additional clerical assistance to chairmen of con­
ference committees when needed.
            FEES OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

   The question of consideration of an appropriate increase in the
fees of United States commissioners was referred by the Judicial
Conference at its September 1955 session to the Committee on
Supporting Personnel (Jud. Cf. Rpt. pp. 14, 15). A report had
been submitted by the Administrative Office recommending in­
creases in the fee schedule prescribed by § 633 of Title 28, United
States Code, within a maximum limit of $10,500 per year, and
amendment of that section of the statute accordingly. The report
had been considered and its approval recommended by the Com­
mittee on Supporting Personnel with a concurring advisory vote
by the Committee on Court Administration. The recommenda­
tion was adopted by the Conference.

           NEED OF ADDITIONAL JUDGES AS SHOWN BY STATIS'l'ICS

         Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that in its effort
      to determine the number of additional judges who would be re­
      quired to bring the dockets of the courts to reasonable currency,
      the Committee on Court Administration had requested the Con­
      mittee on Statistics to submit a report as to the number of judges
      estimated to be needed based upon the statistics of the workload
      in the several circuits and districts. Such a report had been pre­
      pared and with other data had been considered by the Committee
      on Court Administration which had reached the conclusion, con­
      curred in by the members of the Committee on Supporting Per­
      sonnel, that the additional judgeships listed in it ought to be
      recommended to Congress by the Judicial Conference. After con­
      sideration of the recommendation, the Conference resolved that
      the part of the report of the Committee on Court Administration
      dealing with this matter with the exhibits, including the report
      of the Committee on Statistics, be sent to the judicial councils
      and the judges of the individual courts affected, to the end that
      they may express their views respecting the recommendations and
      give the Conference the basis of their conclusions and any recom­
'-'   mendations which they wish to make.

      1VIETHODS OF SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES OF CIRCUITS AND OF
                              DISTRICT COURTS

         Chief Judge Biggs reported that considerable diversity of views
      had developed in the consideration of various methods proposed
      for selection of chief judges, and the Committee on Court Admin­
      istration had reached the conclusion that it should defer a recom­
      memlation until further information could be secured and dis­
      cussion had with all the members of the Committee on Court
      Administration present. In the meantime the Committee, with
      the concurrence of the Committee on Supporting Personnel, asked
      that the Conference recommend to Congress that no action be
      taken on S. 2359, entitled "A Bill To provide for the designation
      by the President of chief judges of the judicial circuits of the
      United States" until the Committee on Court Administration and
      the Conference could have the opportunity to study further and
      make a recommendation in this connection, this to be done as
      promptly as possible. The Conference agreed to make this
      recommendation.

        RETIREMENT AS CHIEF JUDGE ON ACCOUNT OF AGE

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that after thorough discussion it
                                                                          -
was the unanimous view of the members of the Committee on
Court Administration and the members of the Committee on Sup­
porting Personnel that an age limit should be fixed for relinquish­
ing the duties of chief judge of a circuit or chief judge of a district
court. Although it was recognized that many judges past the age
of 70 are able to continue to discharge the administrative work of
their courts capably, it was believed that the administrative work
of the chief judgeship as distinguished from the judicial work of
a judge can usually be performed more satisfactorily by younger
judges. Some chief judges over 70 have proved unable to carry
on their administrative duties adequately, and it was believed that
it would be conducive to the effective administration of the courts
as a whole and would avoid invidious distinction among judges if
the broad, uniformly enforced rule were adopted that chief judges
of circuits and district courts should cease to act in that capacity
when they reach the age of 70. Such a course is in line with the
almost universal practice with respect to administrative positions
in business and industry as well as with the practice pursued
generally in the executive branch of the Government. After con­
sideration of this matter, the Conference tentatively approved the
                                                                          -
following resolution and voted to refer it to the circuit and district
judges for an expression of views pursuant to the "Phillips Plan"
(Jud. Cf. Rpt. Sept. 1945 Sess. pp. 9,10):
       "Resolved, that the Judicial Conference recommend to
     Congress the enactment of legislation which will provide tha.t
     a chief judge of a circuit or a chief judge of a district court
     shall cease to be chief judge of his circuit or his court at the
     age of 70 provided however that the Act shall not become
     effective until one year after its passage."
   The Conference voted to request that further consideration by
Congress of H. R. 7161, entitled "A Bill To amend sees. 45 and
136 of Title 28) United States Code, to provide that chief judges
of circuits and district courts shall be relieved of the duties of
chief judge after reaching the age of 75" be postponed pending
final action upon the resolution above quoted.

     MEMBERSHIP OF DISTRICT JUDGES IN THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE
                           OF THE UNITED STATES

        The Conference was informed that it had been found that con­
     siderable sentiment exists. throughout the judiciary for represen­
     tation of district judges on the Judicial Conference and that all
     members of the Committee on Court Administration to whom
     the matter had been referred for consideration and also the mem­
     bers of the Committee on Supporting Personnel are of the view
     that district judges should be made members of the Conference.
     The Committee on Court Administration, therefore, recommended
     that the Judicial Conference recommend to the Cong,TeSs. the en­
     actment of legislatjon which would provide for membership on the
     Judicia] Conference of the United States of one district judge from
     each of the eleven circuits to be elected for a term of 3 years by the
     circuit and district judges of the circuits at the annual circuit con­
     ferences. The Conference directed that this recommendation be
     circulated among the judges for an expression of views pursuant
     to the "Phillips Plan" (Jud. Cf. Rpt. Sept. 1945 Sess. pp. 9, 10).
        During the discussion in the Judicial Conference, a suggestion
     was made that th(" terms of the district judges elected from the
--   different circuits for membership in the Judicial Conference be
     staggered so that the terms of as nearly as possible a third of the
     members of the Judicial Conference who are district judges would
     begin and end each year.

                            JUDICIAL VACATIONS

        The Conference received a report of the Committee on Court
     Administration on the subject of vacations of judges. After con­
     sideration, the Conference directed, upon motion of Judge Biggs,
     that the report of the Committee be circulated under the "Phillips
     Plan" (Jud. Cf. Rpt. Sept. Sess. 1945 pp. 9, 10) for an expression
     of the views of the judges with the recommendation of the Com­
     mittee on page 4 of the report modified to read as follows:
            "That the Judicial Conference declare it to be the policy of
         the courts of the United States that in those circuits or dis­
         tricts where the disposition of judicial business is not upon a
         current basis vacations or holidays of individual judges should
         not exceed one month per annum."

              AMENDMENT 01<' THE CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT ACT

           Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the Committee
                                                                                -

        on Supporting Personnel had given consideration to proposed leg­
        islation presently pending in Congress to amend the Civil Service
        Retirement Act. The C{)mmittee with the concurrence of the Com­
        mittee on Court Administration recommended that S. 2875 intro­
        duced by Senator Johnston of South Carolina, be approved by
        the Conference insofar as it relates to judicial employees, except as
        to the exclusion of judicial employees from the provisions requiring
        mandatory retirement on account of age, and that the bill be
        amended to include judicial employees within the provisions for
        mandatory retirement at age 70 thus putting them on the same
        basis with employees in the executive branch. The Conference
        approved the recommendation.
              CREATION OF NEW DIVISIONS IN EXISTING DISTRwrs

           The question whether the creation of any additional divisions
        of judicial districts ought to be opposed by the Conference was
        referred to the Committee on Court Administration at the Sep­
        tember 1955 session (Cf. Rpt. p. 14). The Committee reported
        that it was of the view that the creation of divisions within dis­
                                                                                -

        tricts generally is undesirable entailing not infrequently the crea­
        tion of new court quarters with attendant expense. Most of the
        asserted needs for new divisions can be met by judicious action of
        the district courts and their judges or by appropriate resolutions
        passed by the judicial councils of the circuits. Attention was called
        to the provisions of § 134 (c), Title 28, United States Code, as
        follows:
                "If the public interest and the nature of the business of a
             district court require that a district judge should maintain
             his abode at or near a particular place for holding court in
             the district or within a particular part of the district the
             judicial council of the circuit may so declare and may make
             an appropriate order. If the district judges of such a district
             are unable to agree as to which of them shall maintain his
             abode at or near the place or within the area specified in such
             an order the judicial council of the circuit may decide which
             of them shall do so. As amended Feb. 10, 1954, c. 6, § 2 (b)
             (13) (a), 68 Stat. 12."
                                      13 

     While the statute is applicable only to district judges appointed
     after February 10, 1954, it nonetheless provides a method of trans­
     ferring judges' official residences which has been used effectively.
     The Committee on Court Administration with the concurrence
     of the Committee on Supporting Personnel, therefore, recom­
     mended that the Conference oppose the creation of any additional
     divisions of judicial districts except under exceptional circum­
     stances. The Conference adopted the recommendation.

                               PASSPORT FEES

       At the September 1955 session a bill, H. R. 5844, to increase the
     fee for execution of a passport application before the clerk of a
     State court from $1 to $2 without increasing the fee of $1 for
     execution of applications before clerks of the United States district
     courts was referred to the Committee on Court Administration.
     The Committee was relieved of further consideration of this matter
     for the reason that the bill was enacted into law on February 10,
     1956 (P. L. 403, 84th Congress).
                  DIVERSITY OF CITIZENSHIP JURISDICTION

__     The Committee on Court Administration requested and was
     granted further time for consideration of proposals to modify the
     present diversity of citizenship jurisdiction of the United States
     courts, including H. R. 91 and H. R. 5007 which were referred to
     the Committee at the September 1955 session (Jud. Cf. Rpt. p. 14).

                  BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
        Judge Phillips, chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy Ad­
     ministration, reported that the Committee had met and considered
     the recommendations contained in the report of the Bankruptcy
     Division of the Administrative Office which was approved by the
     Director on February 16, 1956, relating to certain changes in sal­
     aries and arrangements for referees and to the filling of vacancies
     in certain referees' positions.
        The report had been circulated by the Director among the dis­
     trict judges and the judicial councils of the circuits concerned, as
     well as the members of the Judicial Conference. The Committee
     also had before it the recommendations of the district judges and
     the judicial councils and these, with the report of the Committee,
     were before the Conference.

             MISCELLANEOUS BANKRUPrCY MATTERS

   Seventh Circ.uit-Eastern District of Wisconsin.-The Commit­
tee recommended that the proposed change from part-time to
full-time for the referee position at Milwaukee be further deferred
until the regular annual meeting of the Judicial Conference in the
fall of 1956. The Conference approved this recommendation.
   Appropriation.-Upon the recommendation of the Committee
the Conference authorized the Director to seek at the first oppor­
tunity a supplemental appropriation for 1956 for referees' salaries
in an amount sufficient to defray the cost of the changes in salaries
and arrangements approved by the Conference.
   Section 60 and Related Sections.-At the meeting of the Om­
ference in March 1955, the Bankruptcy Committee was authorized
to study Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act and related sections
with a view to proposing legislation to clarify their meaning.
Thereafter the chairman of the Committee appointed the following
subcommittee to study the matter:
      Circuit Judge John B. Sanborn, Chairman
      District Judge H. Church Ford, Member
      and Edwin L. Covey, Advisor.
   The subcommittee reported to the Committee the results of its
study thus far but made no definite report. The Committee
recommended that the subcommittee be reconstituted and that it
be authorized to continue its study and report to the full Commit­
                                 16 


tee. The Committee also recommended that it be authorized in
connection with such study to consider proposals to enlarge the
summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. These recommen­
dations were approved by the Conference.
   Resolution of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit.-The
Judicial Conference of the United States, at its meeting in Sep­
tember 1955, referred to the Committee on Bankruptcy Admin­
istration for consideration and report, the following resolution
adoption by the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit:
         "RESOLVED, that this conference refer to the Judicial
      Conference of the United States the question as to the need
      for amending section 7, section 324 and section 331 of the
      Bankruptcy Act, and to recommend to Congress an amend­
      ment providing for adequate procedure for filing a Chapter
      XI proceeding without schedules and statements of affairs
      where the judge or judges are absent from the district, and
      further providing for an order of reference under Chapter XI
      by the clerk under the same circumstances." (Jud. Cf. Rpt.
      Sept. Sess 1955 p. 19).
   Inasmuch as the Bankruptcy Act makes no provision for the
reference of a Chapter XI proceeding by the clerk of the court to a
                                                                          -, 

 referee in the absence of all the district judges from the district
or division in which the proceeding is filed as is provided in the
case of a voluntary straight bankruptcy proceeding, and in order
 to conform Chapter XI to the procedure in ordinary bankruptcy
 cases, the Committee recommended that section 331 of the Bank­
 ruptcy Act be amended to read substantially as follows:
         "Sec. 331. The judge may at any stage of a proceeding un­
      der this chapter refer the same to a referee either generally
      or specially. If the judge or all the judges are absent from
      the district, or the division of the district in which a petition
      under this chapter is filed, at the time of the filing, the clerk
      shall forthwith refer the case to the referee."
    The Committee further recommended that the Administrative
 Office be directed to undertake to obtain enactment of the legisla­
 tion proposed either in an amendment to pending legislation or
 in a separate bill. The recommendations of the Committee were
 approved by the Conference.
    Cost of Bankruptcy Administration.-The Committee brought
 to the attention of the Conference the studies that have been made
  by the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office relating to
                                     17 

    the costs of administration in bankruptcy cases and recommended
    that the results of these studies be brought to the attention of the
    bankruptcy courts where the costs of administration recurrently
    exceed the nationa,} average. The recommendation of the Com­
    mittee was approved by the Conference.

               OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
       Judge Watkins, chairman of the Committee on the Operation of
    the Jury System, told the Conference that his Committee had noth­
    ing to report at this time.
       The Director informed the Conference that he had been requested
    to give to the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives
    an expression of views with regard to proposed legislation to pro­
    hibit the recording of jury proceedings. After consideration, it was
    moved and carried that the Conference approve in principle the
    bill, H. R. 8328, entitled "A Bill To amend Title 18, United States
    Code, so as to prohibit intrusion upon the privacy of Federal juries."
       A proposed amendment to § 1870 of Title 28, United States
    Code, relating to the number of peremptory challenges of jurors
    allowable in civil cases, which had been recommended by the
~   Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit, was referred to the Committee
    on the Operation of the Jury System for consideration and report
    to the Conference.
       The Director was authorized to circulate to circuit and district
    judges a report of the Administrative Office concerning the opera­
    tion of the petit jury system during the first 6 months of the current
    fiscal year.
                             HABEAS CORPUS
      Judge Denman moved that the Conference withdraw its approval
    of H. R. 5649, entitled etA Bill To amend section 2254 of Title 28
    of the United States Code in reference to applications for writs of
    habeas corpus by persons in custody pursuant to the judgment of
    a State court" (approved by the Conference at the March 1955
    session, Cf. Rpt. p. 18; reaffirmed at the September 1955 session,
    Cf. Rpt. p. 23) and recommend that the bill be amended to read
    as follows:
            "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
         of the United States in Congress assembled, that section 2254

-        of Title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding thereto
         the following paragraphs:
                                 18
            ttThe decision of the District Court upon the applica­
         tion shall be res judicata of all issues of law and fact
         existing at the time of its filing, save those of fact then
         concealed from the knowledge of the applicant.
            "An order denying an application for a writ of habeas
         corpus by a person in custody pursuant to a judgment of
         a State ('A)urt or an order denying relief if 8uch a writ
         be granted shall be reviewable only on a writ of certiorari
         by the Supreme Court of the United States. The peti­
         tion for the writ of certiorari shall be filed within thirty
         days of the entry of such an order."
  The motion failed. Judge Denman requested that his vote be
recorded "aye."

PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO SECTION 2255 OF TITLE 28,
            UNITED STATES CODE

   A resolution of the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit recom­
mending an amendment to § 2255 of Title 28, United States Code,
relating t<> the appearance of a prisoner at a hearing on a motion
to vacate or correct a sentence against him, was referred to the
Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law for con­
sideration and report to the Conference.
                                                                        -
       AIR CONDITIONING OF COURT QUARTERS

  Chief Judge Parker, chairman of the Committee on Air Con­
ditioning of Court Quarters, informed the Conference that it ap­
peared that the appropriation of $1,150,000.00 for air conditioning
of court quarters during the current fiscal year would be sufficient
to take care of a few additional projects beyond those heretofore
put on the highest priority schedule by the Committee. Accord­
ingly, he had asked the Administrative Office to make recommen­
dations for additional projects to be pla.ced on this schedule and
had mailed the recommendations to the members of his Committee
for consideration.

        COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Judge Maris, chairman of the Committee on Revision of the
Laws, submitted a report on behalf of the Committee.
                                     19 

       At the September 1954 session, the Conference directed that
    there be circulated among the judges for an expression of views
    a proposal made by Prof. George B. Fraser of the College of Law
    of the University of Oklahoma of amendment in two particulars
    of § 1441 of Title 28, United States Code, pertaining to the removal
    of cases from State courts (Jud. Cf. Rpt. Sept. Sess. 1954 p. 27).
    The first recommendation was that the statute be amended 80 as
    to permit the removal of a case improperly brought in the State
    court and of which that court does not have jurisdiction because
    exclusive jurisdiction has been given by Congress to the Federal
    courts. The second was that removal be authorized from the State
    to the Federal court if at the time of removal instead of at the
    time it was brought in the State court it appears from either the
    complaint or the petition for removal that the action involves a
    federal question. Judge Maris reported that a large majority of
    the judges responding to a request for an expression of views on
    these proposals had disapproved both. The Committee recom­
    mended that both proposals be disapproved. The recommenda­
    tion was adopted.
       Judge Maris stated that in view of the very recent reorganiza­
    tion of the Committee it had not been possible to give consideration
-   to a number of matters referred to it. He requested and was
    granted leave for the Committee to consider these matters further
    and report upon them to a later session of the Conference.

     APPEALS FROM INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS OF THE
                  D~STRICT COURTS

       On motion of Judge Parker, the Conference requested the Com­
    mittee on Revision of the Laws to assume responsibility for pro­
    moting the enactment of proposed legislation to enlarge the scope
    of appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts which
    was approved by the Conference at the September 1953 session
    (Jud. Cf. Rpt. p. 27). The bill has been introduced in the House
    of Representatives as H. R. 8331.

      EXTENSION OF THE TERM OF JUDGES IN ALASKA
      The Conference considered and voted to recommend to Congress
    the approval of H. R. 8937, entitled "A Bill To amend the law so as
    to provide that the term of office of district judges in Alaska shall
    be 8 years."

    AMENDMENTS TO RULES ADOPTED BY COURTS OF
     APPEALS FOR REVIE\V OR ENFORCEMENT OF
     ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES
      The Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, First
    Circuit and Sixth Circuit submitted to the Conference for approval
    pursuant to the provisions of the Act of December 29, 1950 (64
    Stat. 1129, 1132; 5 U. S. C. 1041) amendments to rules adopted
    by those courts relating to the review and enforcement of orders
    of administrative agencies. The amendments were approved.
    The rules involved are as follows: District of Columbia Circuit,
    rule 38 paragraph gi First Circuit, rule 16 paragraph 7; and Sixth
    Circuit, rule 13.

                THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM
      The Director reported that Judge Follmer of the Middle District
   of Pennsylvania had requested that the number of court reporters
   for the District Court for that district be increased from 2 to 3
   so that a regular reporter would be available for Judge Follmer's
   part of the court at Lewisburg. Two regular reporters stationed
__ at Scranton now serve the parts of the court of Chief Judge John
   W. Murphy and Judge Albert L. Watson, retired. The Director
   recommended and the Conference approved the appointment of
   one additional reporter for the Middle District of Pennsylvania at
   a salary of $5,375 per annum to correspond with that of the other
   reporters for the district, with a reservation that the number of
   regular reporters for the court revert to 2, the number of active
   judges when Judge Watson ceases to perform judicial service.
      The Director also informed the Conference that in view of the
   death of Judge James A. Donohoe of Nebraska the combined po­
   sition of court reporter-secretary heretofore authorized for that
   district would no longer be necessary, and recommended that the
   former status of the reporter at Omaha be reestablished as a re­
   porter only effective, March 26, 1956, at a salary of $5,375. The
   recommendation was approved.

                NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS
      After consideration, H. R. 4317, entitled teA Bill To amend
    section 631 of Title 28, United States Code, so as to provide that
                                22 

National Park Commissioners shall be appointed upon recommen­
dation of the Secretary of the Interior" was disapproved by the
Conference.

APPROPRIATION FOR RENTAL OF SPACE FOR THE
           ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
  The Chief Justice stated that there is not sufficient space in the
Supreme Court Building for the Court and all activities of the
Administrative Office. Accordingly, the Conference approved the
submission of an estimate for a supplemental appropriation in
such amount as may be found to be required for rental of space for
a part of the Administrative Office outside the Supreme Court
Building and any expenses incurred in removal thereto and in
connection with resulting changes in the quarters of the office.
  The Conference declared a recess, subject to the call of the Chief
Justice.
