jurisdictions, and reviewed the need for additional judicial assis-
                                                                      C)

tance. The Conference was informed that the Judicial Council
of the Eighth Circuit disapproved the provision contained in S.
2799, which passed the Senate on August 30, 1957, to create an
additional judgeship for the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit on a temporary basis. Upon the recommenda­
tion of the Committees on Court Administration and Judicial
Statistics, the Conference also disapproved the proposal.
   The recommendation of the Judicial Council of the Sixth Cir­
cuit for the creation of an additional judgeship for the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, in
addition to the one heretofore recommended by the Conference,
was referred to the Committees on Court Administration and Judi­
cial Statistics for further study and report to the Conference.
JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORTING
  PERSONNEL AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT AD­
  MINISTRATION
  Chief Judge Biggs, chairman of the Committee on Supporting
Personnel and of the Committee on Court Administration, made
a joint report for the two Committees.
                        COURT REPORTERS

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that a number of representatives
of the Conference of United States Court Reporters had appeared
before the Committees and presented the views and various pro­
posals of their association in regard to compensating court re­
porters. The Committees considered the proposals of the court
reporters and numerous reports and compilations prepared by the
Administrative Office, including a number of letters from the
United States District Judges respecting the difficulties they were
encountering in securing and retaining competent reporters under
the present system. The Committees were also furnished com­
pilations and reports respecting the status of reporters within the
system prepared by the Conference of United States Court Re­
porters. The Committees were of the view that the matter re­
quires more extensive study and authoriz.ed the chairman to
appoint a subcommittee of the Committee on Supporting Person­
nel to conduct a further study and report to the Committees.
  As a measure of immediate relief for the reporters the Confer­
                                             4

  ence, upon the recommendation of the Committees, took the fol­
  lowing action:
          (1) Authorized the respective United States District Courts
       to increase the maximum transcript rates 1 for ordinary (as
       distinguished from daily) transcript, of 10 cents a page for
       the original and 5 cents a page for copy, and
          (2) Authorized the Administrative Office to increase the
       salaries of court reporters by the amount authorized by the
       Federal Employees Pay Act of 1958, if and when enacted.
     Chief Judge Biggs also reported that there had been brought to
  the attention of the Committees the emergency situation in the
  United States District Court for the District of Columbia in
  respect to transcribing pleas and sentences in cases in which crim­
  inal defendants pleaded guilty. The United States Court of Ap­
  peals for the District of Columbia Circuit has now required pleas
  and sentences to be transcribed in all criminal cases, as set out
  in the statute. In order that this may be done without serious
  effects upon the daily operation of the district court, Chief Judge
  Laws requested that the Judicial Conference authorize five addi­
  tional full-time reporters for the court, their services to be made
  available as soon as possible.                                                           (   .I
     Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the Conference
. authorized the employment of five additional full-time reporters
  for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
                        UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Committees had considered
the proposal referred to the Committee on Supporting Personnel
by the Conference at its September 1957 session (Conf. Rept., p.
9) to place full-time United States commissioners on salary, and
are of the view that, in view of the recent statute raising the fee
rates and increasing the maximum compensation allowable to
United States commissioners from $7,500 per annum to $10,500
per annum, it would not be desirable to undertake a revision
of the basis for computation of their pay at this time.
  After a full discussion, the Conference approved the recom­
mendation of the Committees that the compensation of full-time
  1   The previous maXimum authorized rates tor ordinary transCTipt were set by the lu­
                                                     tor orlglnal and 25 cents tor copy.

    United States commissioners not be changed from the present
    fee basis to an annual salary basis.

                              LAw   CLERKS

       The Judicial Conference, at its September 1957 session (Conf.
    Rept., p. 12), directed the Committee on Supporting Personnel
    to study possible revisions of the qualification standards for law
    clerks. Certain legislation on the subject 'is pending. The Com­
    mittee reported that it has the matter under consideration, but
    requires more time before SUbmitting recommendations to the
    Conference. The Committee was authorized to report at a future
    session of the Conference.
                           PROBATION OFFICERS

       The Committees reported that the Administrative Office had
     studied and recommended against the proposal submitted by the
    Federal Probation Officers Association, and referred to the Com­
     mittee on Supporting Personnel by the Conference (Conf. Rept.,
    Sept. 1957, p. 13), that the qualification standards for Chief
     Probation Officer, grade GS-13, be amended by adding the phrase

pending clarification, the amount of the difference between the
salary of the crier at grade GS-4 and that of crier-law clerk at
grade GS-7, which amounts to $1,110, be charged to the allowance
of the appointing judge under the appropriation proviso. The
Committees further recommended as a permanent solution to the
problem that the appropriation proviso with respect to the em..
ployees of a judge be expanded so as to include criers and mes­
sengers appointed by a judge, along with secretaries and law clerks.
and that the maximum allowance for each judge be increased by
the amount of the base pay of a crier, or $3,415. Both recom­
mendations were approved by the Conference.                             r)
              PERSONNEL OF THE CuSTOMS CoURT

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the attention of the Committees
had been called to the proposed amendment to the Appropriations
Act which would remove from the Director of the Administrative
Office the power to fix the classifications and salaries of the em­
ployees of the Customs Court and vest it in the Customs Court.
The proposal presents a substantial deviation from the policy of
uniform control of employees of the Judicial Branch of the Gov­
ernment, as prescribed by 28 United States Code 604, which pro­
vides that the salaries of supporting personnel of the courts shall
be fixed by the Director of the Administrative Office, subject to the
direction of the Judicial Conference of the United States.
  Mter a full discussion the Conference adopted the following
resolution submitted by the Committees:
       "Whereas the budget statement submitted by the Customs
     Court relating to the proposed Judiciary Appropriation Act
     for the fiscal year 1959 contains 1,he recommendation that the
                                          9
              item, 'Salaries and Expenses, United States Customs Court',
              be changed to read in part: 'For * * * salaries of the officers
              and employees of the court as determined by the court'; and
                  "Whereas the new language is designed to place the respon­
              sibility for fixing the grades and salaries of the supporting
              staff of the Customs Court in that court instead of in the
              Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
              Courts; and
                  "Whereas by Section 604 (a) (5) of Title 28 of the United
              States Code the Director is required to fix the compensation
              of the employees of the United States courts; and the Cus­
              toms Court is, according to Section 610 of Title 28 of the
              Code, a court of the United States, and included within the
             federal judiciary established under Article III of the Consti­
              tution [28 U. S. C. 251] ; and
                  "Whereas, if one court in the federal judicial system be per­
              mitted to fix the compensation ·of its employees, every other
           , federal court should be allowed the same privilege, and such
            . procedure would destroy every semblance of order in the
             financial features of this branch of the government;
               .. "Now, Therefore, be it Resolved that the Judicial Confer..
(          . ence of the United States disapproves the above-described
             proposal in respect to the pending appropriation act, and
             recommends that the Congress do not adopt it." .
      'The Director of the Administrative Office was directed to for­
     ward the'foregoing resolution to the appropriate officers arid com­
     mittees of the Congress.
                            ROSTER OF SENIOR JUDGES.

         The Committees. reported that a certain confusion had resulted
       frondhe application of new subsection (d) of Section 294 of Title
       28,United States Code, relating to the assignment and designation
     . by the Chief Justice of the United States of judges from the Roster
       of 'Senior Judges. In order to eliminate this confusion and to co­
       ordinate and unify all of the provisions of Section 294 with respect
       to the designation and assignment of retired judges of the United
       States, the Committees proposed new legislation and submitted the
       following· draft of a bill, which war') approved by the Conference.

 . TERMS OF DISTRICT JUDGES ON THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE .

  Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the Conference
adopted the following resolution in respect to the terms of the
                                     11

RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE OF THE UNITED STATES CoURTS

    The Judicial Conference, at its September 1957 session (Conf.
  Rept., p. 8), referred to the Committees on Court Administration
  and Revision of the Laws the problem of devising procedures for
  the implementation by the Conference of the proposal to have the
  Conference carryon a continuous study of the operation and effect
. of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter
  prescribed by the Supreme Court for the other courts of the United
 States pursuant to law. S. 3152 and H. R. 10154, pending in: the
 85th Congress, are identical to the draft of bill approved by the
 Conference. The Co:ri:unitteeswere authorized by the Conference
 to postpone action in respect to implementation of the proposal
 until the proposal has been enacted into law.           .
  SUBPOENA PoWERS FOR JUDICIAL CoUNCILS OF THE CIRCUITS

  Chief Judge Biggs reported that he had submitted to the Com­
mittees a proposal to provide the judicial councils of the circuits
                                        12 

with subpoena powers. The Committees were of the view that
such a power was desirable for the judicial councils, which are the
administrative bodies of the circuits, and recommended legisla­
tion to accomplish this purpose.
   After a full discussion, the Conference directed that the follow­
ing draft of a bill, together with an explanatory statement to be
furnished by the Chairman of the Committees, be circulated among
the circuit and district judges by the Administrative Office re­
questing an expression of views in regard to the proposal:
A BILL To amend Section332 of Title 28, United States Oode.

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
     of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
     Section 332 of Title 28 of the United States Code is amended
     by adding at the end of the last paragraph thereof a new
     sentence reading as follows:
       "If the judicial council finds it to be necessary, in order
     to carry out its duties under this section, to obtain the testi­
     mony of any other person or to inspect any books or papers
     in the custody of any other person, it may issue a Bubpoena
     requiring such person to appear before the judicial council
     and give testimony, or the custodian thereof to produce such
     books or papers to the judicial council, touching the matter
     under investigation, and any failure to obey such subpoena
     may be punished by the court of appeals of the circuit as a
     contempt thereof."                       .. .
PRETRIAL EXAMINER FOR T:a:E        UNrrEn STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
                      THE DISTRICT       OF CoLUMBIA
   There has been submitted        to
                                 the Committees the proposal· of
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
for the appointment by. that court of an officer to be known as
a "pretrial examiner" to deal at the pretrial level primarily with
motor vehicle tort cases involving personal· injury and property
damage. The Committees were of the opinion that such an officer
would accelerate the disposition of business in the United States
District Court and effect substantial savings of the time of the
judges. Under the plan, the pretrial examiner would be author­
ized· to engage a clerk . and a secretary to assist him, and the
salaries of the two employees would be fixed at appropriate grades
                                                                        (
                                    13 

    by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
    Courts. The Committees suggested that the examiner so ap­
    pointed be paid at least $17,500 per annum.
      The Committees recommended that the suggested plan be ap­
    proved on an experimental basis and, if successful, that it might
    be adopted in some of the other heavily burdened metropolitan
    courts. The Conference authorized the employment of a pretrial
    examiner in the District of Columbia together with the assistants
    necessary to permit him to function efficiently, and authorized
    the inclusion in the judicial budget of an amount sufficient to
    provide for the employment of the pretrial examiner and his
    assistants.
      TRIAL AND ApPELLATE DIVISIONS IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS

       The Judicial Conference, at its September 1957 session (Conf.
    Rept. p. 44), referred to the Committee on Court Administration
    the proposal contained in H. R. 6954 to authorize the Court of
    Claims by its rules to create trial and appellate divisions. The
    Committees were informed that this particular matter was not
    being pressed by the Court of Claims and, therefore, it was un­
    necessary for them to reach any conclusion in regard to the matter
    or to make a report thereon.
        UNIFORM RULES OF EVIDENCE FOR THE FEDERAL CoURTS

       The Committees reported that they were of the view that fur­
    ther consideration of the proposal to establish uniform rules of
    evidence for the federal courts was necessary before an adequate
    report thereon could be made to the Conference. The Commit­
    tee on Court AdminIstration was given leave to report in respect
    to this matter at a future meeting of the Conference..
                         ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

      At the September 1957 session of the Judicial Conference (Con£.
    Rept. p. 14), the Committees on Court Administration and Sup­
    porting Personnel filed a joint report calling attention to S. 2292
    and H. R. 8751,.85th Congress, which the Committees stated em­
    bodied a proposal approved by the American Bar ASSQci~tiori· for
    the creation otan Administrative Court under Article III of the
    Constitution of the United States to take over jurisdiction, now
    exercised by the Tax Court and by certain administrative ~~ncies.
(

                                 14 


  The language employed in the report stated that S. 2292 and H. R.
  8751,85th Congress, had been approved by the American Bar As­
  sociation. The Committees reported that this statement was
r€ roneous in that the bills were not approved by the American Bar
Association, and expressed their regrets to the Chief Justice and
members of the Conference.
             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   Circuit Judge Phillips, chairman of the Committee on Bank­
ruptcy Administration, reported that, pursuant to the direction of     1

t.he Conference at its meeting in September 1957 (Conf. Rept. p.
21), the Committee had studied the questions of policy pr'esented
by the creation of an additional full-time referee position at a
salary less than the salary of an existing full-time position in the   I

same district. The chairman presented a special report on behalf       <
of the Committee which reviewed the establishment of the
Referees' Salary System and outlined the statutory provisions re­
lating to the number and territories of referees, the surveys both
general and special to be made by the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office, and the procedures and criteria to be considered in
fixing the amount of salaries to be paid to referees, both full-time
and part-time. The Committee observed that the Bankruptcy
Act does not contemplate uniform salaries for full-time or part-
time referees. Rather it provides that such salaries shall be fixed
within the prescribed maxima for full-time and part-time referees
upon a consideration of the average number and types of, and
the average amount of gross assets realized from, cases closed and
pending in the territory which the referee is to serve, during the
last preceding period of ten years, together With such other factors
as may be material.                                        ' .
   The Committee pointed out that where there is only one full­
time or part-time referee in a district, no problem is presented,
other than to apply the statutory criteria to the pertinent facts.
   Likewise, where there are two or more referees in a district, but
with each referee assigned to different territory, no problem is
presented, other than the application of the statutory criteria to
the facts with respect to the territory the referee is to serve.
   Where there are two or more referees in a district, each with
concurrent jurisdiction throughout the district or a designated
portion of the district, and no allocation of territory to each
                                       15 

       referee has been made, the procedure followed has been to deter­
       mine the aggregate salary justified under the pertinent facts and
       the statutory criteria and to provide the same salary for each of
       the referees.
         The Committee also brought to the attention of the Conference
       Section 43 (c) of the Bankruptcy Act under which referees may
       be designated to act within their respective districts. or within
       their respective circuits or in different circuits.
         The Committee expressed the view that the practice that had
       been followed in certain districts of permitting the district judge
      or judges to make informal allocations of territory to be served
       by the referees in their district, for the purpose of fixing the
      salaries of referees by applying the statutory criteria to the terri­
       tory informally allocated to each of them, should be discontinued,
      and that the territorial basis for fixing salaries generally should
       be that made by the Judicial Conference.
         The Committee was also of the view that the solution was not
      to provide uniform salaries but to allocate the particular terri­
       tory to be served by the additional referee, fix his salary on the
      basis of the pertinent facts with respect to such territory and the
    , statutory criteria, and leave the matter of one serving in the ter­
      ritory of the other to assignments or designations. Furthermore,
      the Committee pointed out that the best practical allocation of
      territory should be made, and if the facts with respect to such
      allocated territory justify a salary reasonably approximating the
      salary of an existing referee, the additional referee should receive
      the same salary as the existing referee. Moreover, in some cases,
      concurrent jurisdiction, rather than separate territory for each
      referee, may be the best allocation. In such event the salaries
      ordinarily should be the same.
         The report of the Committee was adopted by the Conference.
                CHANGES IN SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS

        The chairman reported that the Committee had considered the
     recommendations contained in the report of the Bankruptcy Divi­
     sion of the Administrative Office which was approved by the Di­
     rector on January 24, 1958, relating to changes in salaries and
     arrangements, as well as the supplemental report, dated February
     10, 1958, relating to the filling of a vacancy in the District of
     Oregon.
(

   The reports of January 24, 1958 and February 10, 1958, had
been submitted by the Director to the members of the Judicial
Conference and to the judicial councils and district judges con.,.
cerned, in accordance with the Bankruptcy Act. These reports,
together with the views expressed by the district judges and the
circuit councils, were considered by the Committee. The Confer­
ence, having before it the Committee's report and recommenda­
tions, as well as the recommendations of the Director, the circuit
councils, and the district judges, took the action shown in the fol­
lowing table relating to changes in salaries and arrangements:

               SECTION   60   AND RELATED SECTIONS

  The Judicial Conference, at its September 1957 session (Conf.
Rept. p. 22), approved the recommendation of the Committee
that H. R. 5195, 85th Congress, which would have the effect of
promoting statutory liens on personal property not accompanied
by possession to a position ahead of costs of administration and
wage claims, be redrafted so as to preserve the position of costs of
administration as it now exists under present law, with a proviso
that the postponement of such statutory liens should not thereby
in any way affect the standing, position, rank or seniority of valid
contractual liens on personal property. The Committee reported
that such an amendment had been drafted and approved by the
National Bankruptcy Conference, providing for the insertion of
a new clause between clauses 2 and 3 of subsection c of Section
67 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U. S. C. 107c). It would preserve
the present position of costs of administration and wages and, at
the same time, enable valid contractual liens, such as chattel
mortgages, conditional sales contracts, trust receipts, and the like,
to retain their position ahead of tax liens on personal property not
accompanied by possession. The new clause is as follows:
       "(3) Every tax lien on personal property not accompanied         I

     by possession shall be postponed in payment to the debts
     specified in clauses (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) of Section
     64 of this Act, and to all liens indefeasible in bankruptcy."
  Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved the foregoing amendment to H. R. 5195, and recom­
mended the passage of the bill as so amended. .
 DETERMINATION OF THE DISCHARGEABILITY OF PROVABLE DEBTS

  The Committee called attention to the action of the Conference
at its September 1957 session (Conf. Rept. p. 24) approving H. R.
106, 85th Congress, as passed by the House of Representatives,
which would give jurisdiction to the Bankruptcy Court to de­
termine the dischargeability or nondischargeability of provable
debts. The bill, as passed by the House, removes from Section
14c (3) the making of a false financial statement as a ground
for a complete denial of a discharge. The National Bankruptcy
Conference, at its meeting in Washington in November 1957, dis­
                                        19
        approved the complete removal of Section 14c (3) and recom­
        mended that it be retained in the following amended form:
               "(3) while engaged in business as a sole proprietor, part­
             nership, or as an executive of a corporation, obtained for such
             business money or property on credit or as an extension or
             renewal of credit by making or publishing or causing to be
             made or published in any manner. whatsoever a materially
            false statement in writing respecting his financial condition
             or the financial condition of such partnership or corporation;"
          With such an amendment, individual bankrupts not engaged
        in business could obtain a discharge from all debts except those
        incurred in reliance upon a materially false statement in writing.
        These particular debts, however, would be nondischargeable under
        Section 17, as amended by H. R. 106.
"
          Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
        approved the proposed amendment of Section 14c (3) and recom­
        mends the enactment of H. R. 106 with the foregoing amendment.
        SUBMISSION UNDER THE PHILLIPS PLAN OF PROPOSAL         To ENLARGE
            THE SUMMARY JURISDICTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

    (      The Committee reported that the proposals recommended by
        the Committee at the September 1956 session of the Conference
         (Conf. Rept. p. 25) to enlarge the summary jurisdiction of the
        Bankruptcy Court over proceedings against third parties to recover
        preferences or set aside fraudulent transfers under Seetions -60b,
        67c, and 70e had been circulated under the Phillips Plan as di­
        rected by the Conference. The Committee presented a memoran­
        dum setting forth a summary of the replies received from the cir­
        cuit conferences and individual judges in response to the submis­
        sion. Of the eight judicial conferences of the Circuits, which had
        considered the proposed legislation, seven had voted approval of
        it. The Committee recommended, with Judge Lynne dissenting,
        that the Conference approve the proposal of the Bankruptcy Com­
        mittee and recommend to Congress the adoption of legislation to
        enlarge the summary jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. The
        Conference approved the recommendation of the Colllillittee, and
        voted to recommend to Congress the enactment of a bill effecting
        the following amendments to the Bankruptcy.Act:
                                  20 


         (1) Amend the last sentence of Section 60b to read as
      follows:
         "The court, after due notice to all parties in interest, shall
      have summary jurisdiction of any proceeding brought under
      this section for the purpose of recovering or avoiding a pref­
      erence'."
         (2) Amend Section 67e to read as follows:
         "e. The court, after due notice to all parties in interest,
      shall have summary jurisdiction of any proceeding brought
      under this section for the purpose of recovering. or avoiding
      a transfer."
         (3) (a) Repeal clause (3) of subsection e of Section 70.
         (b) Add a new subsection f to Section 70 to read as follows:
        ufo The court, upon due notice to all parties in interest,
     shall have summary jurisdiction of all proceedings brought
    . under this Section for the purpose of recovering or avoiding
      any preference, transfer or obligation."
         (c) Reletter the present subsections f and g of Section
      70 as subsections g and h respectively.
        CONCEALMENT OF ASSETS IN BANKRUPTCY CASES

  The Committee reported that there had been brought to its
attention by the Administrative Office H. R. 10599, 85th Con­
gress, introduced at the request of the Attorney General, to amend
the sixth paragraph of 18 U. S. C. 152, relating to the concea1ment
of 1lS8ets in bankruptcy cases. The purpose of the proposed
amendment is to make .certain that individuals who conceal prop­
erty in contemplation of bankruptcy be held accountable when
they act on their own behalf, as well as when they act for any
other person or corporation. The Committee recommended ap­
proval of H. R. 10599 with, however, a clarifying amendment
making the bill read as.follows:
        . "Whoever, either individually or as an agent or officer orany
      person or corporation, in contemplation of a bankruptcy PI-O­
   . ceeding by or against any person or corporation, or with intent
      to defeat the bankruptcy law, knowingly and fraudulently
      transfers or conceals any of the property.of such person or
     .corporation, or"
                                          21

            The Conference approved the clarifying amendment suggested
    ?"   by the Committee and recommended the passage of .H. R. 10599
         so amended.
            BLANKET BONDS FOR REFEREES, RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES

         . The Committee reported that the Administrative Office had
         brought to the attention of the Committee a proposal to provide
         a blanket bond for referees in bankruptcy, the cost to be paid
         from the referees' expense fund. Upon the recommendation of
         the Committee, the Conference approved the proposal in prin­
         ciple, and directed the Administrative Office to work out and re­
         port to the Conference the mechanics by which such proposal
         should be put into effect, including any necessary amendments to
         the Bankruptcy Act.
            A similar proposal to provide a blanket bond to cover all re­
         ceivers and trustees was referred to the Administrative Office for
         furtherstudy.
                 IMPROVEMENTS IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURES AND
                                   ADMINISTRATION

             The Committee reported that the tremendous upsurge in the
         volume of bankruptcy cases has made simplification and improve­
         ment of bankruptcy procedures and administration imperative,
         and that the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office
         8.:!ld the Committee are currently engaged in studies in certain
         areltS with the purpose of attaining those objectives. These mat­
         ters include the consideration of fixing automatically, upon the
(
         filiIlg of the petition, the status of the petitioner as a bankrupt in
         vohmtary cases, which would eliminate considerable paperwork;
         the entering by the clerk of an order of reference in voluntary
         cases; providing a panel of standing trustees to serve in small
         cases.or in cases which appear from the petition to be nonasset
         ease~; and providing blanket bonds for trustees in small cases ..
             rhe COmmittee reported that the Bankruptcy Division of the
         Administrative Office, in accordance with the direction of the Con­
         ference(Conf. Rept. Sept. 1957, p. 24), is continuing its cost of
         administration studies in districts where costs seem to be abnor­
         mally high, and is accomplishing cQn~tructive results.

         WAGE EARNERS' PLANS UNDER CHAPTER           XIII
   The Committee reported that it is of the opinion that means         r
should be devised to bring about a greater utilization of Chapter
XIII, Wage Earners' Plans, in appropriate cases. The Commit­
tee believes that a procedure by which a debtor, financially in­
volved and unable to meet his debts as they mature, works out his
involvement and pays his debts in full over a period of time, is
good for his creditors and good for him. The Committee sug­
gested that referees might be directed by the district judges to
consider at the first meeting of creditors whether the case" is an
appropriate one for a Chapter XIII proceeding and, if so, to urge
consideration by the debtor and his lawyer, if he is represented
by counsel.
   In order to widen the scope of Chapter XIII relief, the Com­
mittee recommended that Section 606 (8) of the Act be amended
to read as follows:                                      .
        "Wage earner" shall mean an individual whose principal
     income is derived from wages, salary, or commissions.
This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
   In order to permit the referee to reduce the charge where a
trustee is handling a large number of Chapter XIII cases and thus
reduce the cost to the debtor, the Committee also recommended
that Section 659 (3) of the Act, which fixes the commissions of
the trustee in Chapter XIII cases at five per centum upon the
amount of payments actually made by or for the debtor, -be
amended to provide that the commissions of the trustee in Chap­
ter XIII cases be fixed at not more than five per centum upon the
amount of payments actually made by or for the debtor. The
recommendation of the Committee was approved by the Con­
ference.
   Leave was requested to have the Administrative Office distrib­
ute that portion of the Committee's report under the heading
"Improvements in Bankruptcy Procedures and Administration'I,
including the recommendations for a greater utilization of Wage
Earners' Plans, to the district judges, clerks of court and referees
with a request that they give the Bankruptcy Committee· the
benefit of their views and suggestions with respect to such im­
provements. The Administrative Office was directed to comply
with this request of the Committee.

       COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS 

    Judge Maris, chairman, submitted the report of the Committee
 on Revision of the Laws. Upon the recommendation of the Com­
 mittee, the Conference approved the following bill, which contains
 a proposal previously endorsed by the Conference:
    (1) Cost of living allowances to judicial employees stationed
 outside the continental United States Or in Alaska.-S. 3374, 85th
Congress, is identical with H. R. 5801, 85th Congress, which was
 approved by the Judicial Conference at its session in March 1957.
 (Conf. Rept. p. 24.)
   The Committee reported as follows concerning legislation upon
 which reports or other action have been requested by the
Conference :
    (1) Review of orders of Interstate Commerce Commission­
Commission to be respondent in suits under Sections 2322 and
2323 of Title 28, United States Code.-S. 1721 and H. R. 6085,_
85thCongress, would amend Sections 2322 and 2323 of Title 28,
United States Code, so as to provide that suits to review orders
of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be brought against
the Commission as respondent, rather than against the United
States. The Committee, pursuant to the direction of the Con­
ference (Conf. Rept. September 1957, p. 40), had obtained the
views of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of the Depart­
ment of Justice with respect to the proposal embodied in these
bills and submitted them to the Conference. After a full discus­
sion, the Conference voted to return the proposal to the Com­
mittee for further study.
   (2) Rules of practice and procedure for the Federal Courts.-­
The Committee joined in the recommendation of the Committee
on Court Administration that no steps be taken in respect to the
implementation of the proposal to have the Judicial Conference
make a continuous study of the rules of practice and procedure
for the Federal courts until the proposal has been enacted into
law.
   The Committee reported that it had considered the following
bills pending in Congress upon which requests by Co:mrnittees of
Congress for reports have been referred to the Committee by the­
Director of the Administrative Office:
                                  24 

   (1) Commission and Advisory Committee on International
 R'ules of Judicial Procedure.--S. 1890 and H. R. 4642, 85th Con­
  gress, would establish a Commission on International Rules of
  Judicial Procedure together with an advisory committee .to make
  a comprehensive study of the existing practices of judicial assist­
  ance and cooperation between the United States and foreign
  countries with a view to achieving improvements. The Commis­
 13ion's work would be completed by December 31, 1959, with a
  report to the President as to possible treaties, conventions, or
  legislation which might be helpful in this field. H. R. 4642 passed
  the House of Representatives on February 3, 1958, and is pending
  in the Senate.
     The Committee reported that the bill has the support of the
  American Bar Association and the Department of Justice and
 that the Department of State has also joined in recommending
 .approval of the bilL Upon the recommendation of the Com­
  mittee, the bill was approved by the Conference.
     (2) Retirement of judges of the circuit courts of the Territory
 >of Hawaii.-H. R. 8484, 85th Congress, would include the eleven
  judges of the circuit courts of the Territory of Hawaii in the provi­
.sions of SectiOJ:1 373 of Title 28, United States Code, for the retire­
  ment of judges of the territorial courts. The three judges of the
  Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii are now covered by
  Section 373 as are the two United States district judges for the
  District of Hawaii. The bill also provides that prior service as a
  judge of one of the circuit courts shall be counted in determining
  the length of service of a judge of the Supreme Court of Hawaii
  or a judge of· the United States District Court for the District of
  Hawaii for retirement purposes. The Committee considered it
 'fair and reasonable to include the judges of the circuit courts of
  the Territory of Hawaii in the Retirement Act to the same extent
  as the other judges of Hawaii, particularly since all of them are
. appointed by the President of the United States and all are paid
  a salary from the federal treasury. Upon the recommendation
·of the Committee, the Conference approved the bilL
     (3) Venue in tax refund suits by corporations.-H. R. 9817,
  85th Congress, would establish a rule of venue for tax refund
:suits requiring a corporation to sue the United States in the judi­
  cial district in which it has its principal place of business. A
"liberal forum non conveniens provision is also included which
                                     25
    would permit the court to transfer the suit to any other district
    to meet the convenience of the parties.
       The Committee reported that the bill had been recommended
    by the Section on Taxation of the American Bar Association and
    approved by the Association at its annual meeting in July 1957.
    Its purpose is to remove the uncertainty resulting from the deci­
    sions in the United States district courts, some of which have held
    that a corporation may bring a suit against the United States
    only in the judicial district within which it was incorporated, while
    others have held that the corporation may also sue the United
    States in any district in which the corporation is doing business.
       The Committee was of the opinion that the proposal of the
    American Bar Association was appropriate to resolve the uncer­
    tainty in these cases, but in the interest of precision suggested
    that it would be well to use only the phrase tlprincipal place of
    business" and to strike from the bill the alternate phrases "or
    principal office or agency!}. The Committee pointed out that the
    phrase "principal place of business" has come to have a well­
    defined meaning in the Bankruptcy Act and in other statutes, and
    to refer also to "principal office or agency" in the proposed bill
    seems either to indicate the possibility of an alternate venue or
    to broaden in some undefined way the established meaning of
    "principal place of business." The Committee recommended that
    the Conference approve the bill with an amendment striking out
    the phrase "principal office or agency" wherever it appears. The
    recommendation of the Committee was approved by the Con­
    ference.
       (4) Broaden the scope of the All Writs Act.-H. R. 10634,
    85th Congress, would eliminate from the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C.
    1651, the limitation that writs, which are by that statute au­
    thorized to be issued by the courts, shall be "in aid of their
    respective jurisdictions". The Committee reported that it had
    been informed that the purpose of the bill is to permit the courts
    of appeals to exercise their supervisory functions over the district
    courts by such means as the issuance of a writ of prohibition
    without having to relate the writ to any pending matter which
    may ultimately come before the court of appeals Jor. review, but
    has been unable to secure full information, as to the purposes
    of the bill or the need which its sponsors.see for it. .The bill
    would appear to broaden to an indeterminate extent the. juris­
(
\
                                  26 

 diction of the federal courts to issue common law writs and, in
 view of its broad and ill-defined extension of jurisdiction, the
 Committee, in the light of such information as it has been able
 to secure, recommended that the Conference disapprove the bill.
 The recommendation of the Committee was approved by the
Conference.
    (5) Denial of jurisdiction to the federal courts in certain
cases involving the right of persons to pra.ctice law before state
tribunals.-S. 3386, 85th Congress, would deny to any court of
 the United States jurisdiction to entertain an injunction suit
against the operation or enforcement of state statutes or regu­
lations which have denied the privilege of practicing law in that
state because of (1) subversive, criminal or corrupt activities, or
 (2) refusal to answer questions in a state judicial, legislative, or
executive inquiry relating to such activities or to cooperate therein;
The bill would further deny to the Supreme Court or any other
federal court jurisdiction to review in any manner the decision
of a state court with respect to the validity of any such statute,
rule or regulation or action taken thereunder. It was the view
 of the Committee that the implication of this bill is that the
 courts of the United States should not be. entrusted· with the
determination of the constitutionality of state action in this area
and, accordingly, the Committee recommended disapproval of the
bill. The Conference adopted the recommendation of the
Committee.
   Judge Maris reported that pursuant to the authority given by
the Conference at its September 1956 session (Conf. Rept. p. 46)
the Committee had considered the following bills and proposals:
   (1) Establishment of a United States Court· of Veterans'
Appeals.-H. R. 9722, 85th Congress, would create a new United
States Court of Veterans' Appeals with five judges appointed for
life and with exclusive jurisdiction to review on appeal decisions
of the Board of Veterans' Appeals in the Veterans Administration.
Its decisions would be final and not subject to further review by
any officer or court.
   The Judicial Conference, at its September 1957 session (Coni.
Rept. p. 36) considered H. R. 272, 85th Congress, which would
authorize review of decisions of the Veterans Administration by
the courts of appeals. The Committee suggested that the Con­
ference adhere to the position which it then took; namely, that
                                  27 

no position be taken with respect to the policy involved in pro­
viding for judicial review of veterans' cases, but if such review
is to be granted, it should be in the district court sitting in the
veteran's locality and not in either a United States Court of
Appeals or a special court of appeals, and that in any case the
review should be in accordance with the standards of the Admin­
istrative Procedure Act, as' provided in H. R. 272. The sugges­
tion of the Committee was approved by the Conference.
   (2) Venue in automobile personal injury cases in the district
in which the automobile accident occurred.-H. R. 9748, 85th
Congress, would extend the venue in a particular class of civil tort
actions, namely, actions to recover damages for personal injuries
sustained in an automobile accident, so as to provide that such
actions'may be brought in the judicial district where the accident
occurred, as well as in the' district of the plaintiff's or defendant's
residence. The proposal is intended to overcome the present limi­
tation of venue pointed out in Olberding v. IllinO'br Central Rail­
'foad Co., 346 U. S. 338.
   The Conference, at its September 1957 session (Con!. Rept.
p. 36), approved a similar bill, S. 1000, 85th Congress, which is
broader in that it would provide that an action an any tort claim
may be brought in the judicial district where the act or omission
complained of occurred. It was the opinion of the Committee
that the broader approach of S. 1000 is preferable and that it
Would be unwise to carve out one area in the tort field for special
venue treatment. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that
H. R. 9748 be approved with an amendment broadening it so as
to include within its enlarged venue all tort claims, as would be
~ded by 28 United States Code 1391 (e), if. amended
as proposed by S. 1000. The Conference approved the recommen­
dation of the Committee.
   (3) Proposal to permit cim1 actions against officers and agen­
cies ,of the United States to be brought in any judicial' district
where plaintiff resides.-H. R. . 10892, 85th Congress, would
broaden the venue in civil aotions against officers cd the United
States in their official capacity, persons acting nnder them, or
agencies of the United States so that such suits could be brought
in any judicial district where the plaintiff resides. The bill would
ha..ve a. far-reaching effect, not only upon the business of the dis­
trict courts but also upon the operations of the Department of
                                 28 

Justice. The Committee reported on the bill for the informatipn
of the Conference and suggested that it be given further study.
The Conference authorized such study by the Committee.
   (4) Bonds of United States marshals.-S. 1438 and H. R. 4756,
85th Congress, sponsored by the Attorney General, are intended
to facilitate the blanket bonding of all United States marshals by
the Attorney. General in accordance with the more economical
group purchase plan contemplated by the Act of August 9, 1955,
69 Stat. 618, which became effective on January 1, 1956. The bills
would strike from 28 United States Code 544 the present provision
that the bond of the marshal shall be approved by a judge of the
district court and filed and recorded in the office of the clerk. The
Committee was satisfied that the proposal embodied in these,bil).s
is a good one and deemed it appropriate to transfer the responsi:­
bility for approving marshals' bonds from the district judge to the
Attorney General. The proposal is in line with what has already.
been done in the case of bonds for other court officers. Upon the
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
bills.
  (5) Proposed amendment of rules of courts of appeals to shorten
the time required to perfect proceedings for review of agency
orders.-The Committee reported that a proposal had been pre­
sented by Honorable Willard W. Gatchell, Chairman of the Com­
mittee on Judicial Administration, Federal Bar Association, to
shorten the time required to perfect proceedings for review of
agency orders by requiring. briefs to be filed at an earlier period.
The. Committee has the proposal under consideration and has re~
quested the Administrative OffiGe to circulate it among interested
parties for their views. A report will be made at a future session
of the Conference.
         OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE

   Judge Maris called to the attention oithe Conference its action
at the March 1957 session authorizing the Director of the Admin.,.
istrativ~, Office to submit directly to the appropriate Committees
of the Conference for study andreporl to a later session of the
Conference requests of congressional committees for expressions
of view with -respect to various bills pending in the Congress.
(ConLRept., p.27.) This was done in order to cooperate with
Congress by making it possible to reply to inquiries from con­
                                      29 


    gressional committees as promptly as may be, within the limita­
    tions of Conference procedure.                      .
       Further, to advance the same end, the Committee suggested
    that the Conference authorize the Director immediately after the
    adjournment of each session of the Conference, and without await­
    ing the publication of the formal report of the session, to inform
    the appropriate congressional committees of any action taken by
    the Conference at that session with respect to pending bills as to
    which the committees have requested the views of the judiciary
    or in which they are .otherwise interested. The Conference ap~
    proved the suggestion of the Committee and authorized the Di~
    rector to so communicate with the committees of the Congress.
        COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                    CRIMINAL LAW
      By reason of the recent death of Chief Judge John,J. Parker,
    Chairman of the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal
    Law, Chief Judge Bolitha J. Laws, acting as temporary chairman
    by vote of the Committee, assisted by other Committee members,
    presented the report of the Committee.,
                          DISPARITY OF SENTENCES

        Judge Laws informed the Conference that pursuant to the reso;­
      lution of the Conference at its September 1957 session (Conf.
    'Rept., p. 29) the Committee had given further ,consideration to
    , the report of ita subcommittee on disparity of sentences in con­
      nection with the Advisory Corrections Council, and upon the fur­
      ther study made recommended the following amendments to bills
      heretofore approved by the Judicial Conference:
         (1) H. I. Res. 424, to improve the administration of justice by
     authorizing the establishment of institutes and joint council$ on
     sentencing for the developmentaf objectives, standards, proce­
     dure8and policie8 to be followed in the sentencing of per80ns con­
      victed of offenses against the United States.~The Committee
     believes the establishment of institutes and jOint councils would
     constitute a significant step forward and would represent a worthy
     contribution to the administration of justice. The bill proVides
     for the Attorney General to submit recommendations from time
      to time for the establishment of such institutes and joint councils.
(    and the Committee believes that the bill should also authorize
\
                                  30 

   their establishment by the Judicial Conference of the United
  States, so they may be held in the event the Attorney General
 -fails to make provision for them. The Committee recommended
   that the following sentence be added at the end of subsection (a)
   of the bill:
           "The chief judge of each United States court of appeals
        may at any time submit similar recommendations to the
        Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
        Courts for the consideration of the Judicial Conference of
        the United States."
     The bill was approved by the Conference with the modification
  recommended by the Committee.
      (2) H. J. Res. 425, to authorize the court in sentencing a pris­
  oner to fix an earlier date when the prisoner shall become eligible
  for parole or to except such prisoner from the statutory limitation
  as to eligibility for parole when, in the judgment of the -court, it
 -might reasonably be expected to facilitate the rehabilitation of the
  prisoner.-Judge Laws reported that the subcommittee had been
  informed that outside of the federal courts there are only ten
  jurisdictions among the states of the nation which are still using
  a system of definite sentences. Most jurisdictions, particularly
  those with larger populations and a greater volume of crime, use
  some type of indeterminate sentences, usually a form in which
  both a minimum and a maximum sentence are imposed by the
  court within statutory limits, and thereafter some executive agency
  determines how long the offender needs institutional treatment.
  However, the Committee decided that no fundamental, far-reach­
  ing change should be made in existing federal sentencing proce­
  dures at this time, but that the alternatives open to the sentencing
-judge should be expanded. For this reason, it considered the pro­
  visions of this bill highly desirable.
     The bill, as drafted, provides the sentencing court with two
  additional alternatives in determining parole eligilibility dates
  and in order to reflect these alternatives more clearly the Com­
'rnittee recommended that the last part of subsection (a) of the
  proposed new Section 4208 be amended to read as follows:
          f'Section4208. Fixing eligibility for parole at time of sen­
        tencing.
                                     31
           H(a) Upon entering a judgment of conviction, except where
        the death penalty is mandatory, if the court having jurisdic­
        tion to impose sentence is of the opinion that the ends of
        justice and the best interests of the public require that the
        defendant be sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding
        one year, the court may designate in the sentence imposed a
        time when the prisoner may become eligible for parole, which
        time may be less than, but shall not be more than, the one~
        third limitation now provided in Section 4202 of this title, 01'
        the court may fix only the maximum sentence to be served,
        in which event the prisoner may be released at such time as
        the Board of Parole may determine."
       The Committee reported that a great deal of thought and dis- .
    cussion had been given by its subcommittee to the advisability of
    extending the Federal Youth Corrections Act as contemplated in
    H. R. 8923, 85th Congress. It was concluded that H. J. Res. 425,
    if enacted, would itself provide some benefits which might accrue
    from an extension of the Youth Corrections Act. Accordingly,
    tire Committee recommended that the approval of the Judicial
    Conference to H. R. 8923 be withdrawn, and that the purpose in~
(   tended to be accomplished by that bill be accomplished by amend­
    ing H. J. Res. 425 with the following additional section authorizing
    the judge to make greater use of the Youth Corrections Act pro­
    cedures and facilities in selected cases:
           "Section 4208.
           It(b) Upon entering a judgment of conviction, the court
        may, in the cases of defendants twenty-five years of age and
        under, impose sentence under the provisions of the Federal
        Youth Corrections Act, if in the opinion of the court they are
        suitable for the rehabilitative treatment provided by the
        Federal Youth Corrections Act."
       The Committee also believes that, where indicated, the sentenc­
    ing judge, before imposing final sentence, should be able to receive,
    if he deems it advisable, a more complete study of the defendant
    than is available in a probation officer's report. Facilities for such
    studies are presently in existence, but authority is lacking for the
    judge to reduce or change a sentence after two months, which
    may not afford ample time to complete such study. Accordingly,
    the Committee recommends that an additional section in the
                                  32 

  appropriate chapter of H. J. Res. 425 be inserted substantially as
  follows:
          "Upon the imposition of sentence the court may sentence
       in accordance with other existing provisions of law, or at its
       option may impose a tentative sentence to imprisonment gen­
       erally, which shall be deemed to be for the maximum tenn
       prescribed by law; in such latter event the defendant shall
       be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for a
       complete study of the defendant as described in subsection
        (b) hereof, except that a report based on this study, together
       with any recommendations which the Director believes would
       be helpful in determining the disposition of the case, will be
       furnished to the court within three months unless the court
       grants time for further study not to exceed an additional
       three months. Mter receiving such reports and recommen­
       dations, the court may, in its discretion: (a) reduce the sen­
       tence or (b) place the defendant on probation as'provided by
       Section 3651 of this title."
     The Committee further reported that attention had been giV'~n
'to subsection (c) in H. J. Res. 425 which authorizes the Board
  of Parole to discharge unconditionally a parolee before tlie ex­
  piration' of the maximum sentence, and endorsed· the provision
  which would make it unnecessary for the Board of Parole to
  retain jurisdiction over a prisoner long after he has proved his
  ability to conduct himself as a law-abiding citizen in the com­
  munity. However, the Committee questioned the constitutional­
. ity of the: clause reading, "which unconditional discharge shall
  automatically set aside the conviction and the Board shall· issue
  to such parolee a certificate to that effect," and recommended
  that the clause be stricken from the bill.
     Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
  rescinded its approval of H.. R. 8923 (Conf. Rept. Sept. 1957,
  p.29), approved the foregoing runendments to H. J.Res. 425,
. and recommended the .enactment of the bill as so amended;'
                ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES

 . Judge Laws informed the Conference that the subcommittee
on disparity of sentences had received a suggestion that provision
be :made for a rotating panel of district judges in each circuit,
                                    33 

    which would have power to review sentences upon petition of
    3ggrieved prisoners, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or
    the Board of Parole. A similar system in Massachusetts, en­
    acted in 1943, has worked out successfully, according to the opin­
    ions of a number of judges of that state, and Connecticut recently
    has passed a similar law. However, after deliberation, the sub­
    oommittee recommended that further consideration of a sentence
    review system be deferred until such time as experience has
    tested the effectiveness of the other legislation proposed to reduce
    sentence disparities. The Committee was authorized to defer
    consideration of the proposal.
                 PUNISHMENT FOR CoNTEMPT OF CoURT

       Judge Sam M. Driver reported that the Committee had con­
    sidered H. R. 3768 and H. R. 4076, the purposes of which are
    stated "to guarantee the right of trial by jury in certain contempt
    cases and to restrict citations for contempt to proceedings in­
    volving persons having actual notice of the terms of the writ,
    process, order, rule, decree, or command of the court, and for
    other purposes" and recommends to the Conference that these
    bills be disapproved as unwarranted restrictions on the federal
    courts. The recommendation of the Committee was approved
    by the Conference.
      The Conference also discussed at length the problems presented
    by the imposition of long sentences in certain criminal contempt
    cases and, at the suggestion of Judge Goodman, referred to the
    (»mmittee on the Administration of the Criminal Law the matter
    of the imposition of sentences in such cases for the purpose of
    proposing any statutory change which may appear to be advisable
    in the light of the trend of sentences in. criminal contempt cases.
        PAYMENT OF CoMPENATION TO CoUNSEL ApPOINTED TO
           REPRESENT POOR PERSONS. ACCUSED OF CRIME

       The Judicial Conference, at its September 1957 session (Conf.
    Rept., p. 28), recommended that Congress be urged to enact legis­
    lation to provide for the appointment of public defenders or the
    payment of compensation to counsel appointed by the courts to
    represent indigent defendants accused of crime as embodied in
    H. R. 108 of the 85th Congress. Recently S. 3275 has been intra­
\
                                34 

duced in the Senate embodying the principles of H. R. 108, but
increasing the amounts that may be paid to public defenders and
appointed counsel and making provision for grant-s of funds by
the Director of the Administrative Office to organizations pro­
viding free legal services to indigent defendants in criminal cases.
The request of the congressional committee for a report on this
bill was referred by the Administrative Office to the Committee
on the Administration of the criminal Law. The Committee
reported that S. 3275 deals more effectively with the problem
and recommended that it be approved.
   The Conference was of the view that private organizations pro­
viding free legal services to indigent defendants in criminal cases
should not be subsidized by grants of Government funds and,
accordingly; approved S. 3275 with the proviso that the section
providing for grants of funds to private organizations be stricken
from the bill.
PAYMENT OF ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED BY COUNSEL ApPOINTED
             TO REPRESENT INDIGENT DEFENDANTS

   The Committee reported that it had reconsidered its recom­
mendation, approved by the Conference at its September 1957
session (Conf. Rept., p. 28), that provision be made for the pay­
ment of expenses actually incurred by counsel appointed to repre­
sent indigent defendants, subject to the approval of the district
judge making the appointment, and that appropriate legislation to
that end be drafted by the Administrative Office and submitted to
Congress. Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference directed that action on this matter be deferred by the
Administrative Office until Congress has had an opportunity to
act on the public defender bill.
     INTERSTATE COMPACTS DEALING WITH JUVENILES AND
                     DELINQUENT JUVENILES

  The Committee reported that it had given consideration to
H. J. Res. 10, which would give the several states authority to
enter into compacts or agreements dealing with the supervision,
detention, return, care, treatment and rehabilitation of juveniles
who have been found delinquent. Upon the recommendation of
the Committee the Conference approved the bill.
                                                                       (
                                 35
    INDIGENT DEFENDANTS IN THE DISTRICT OF CoLUMBIA

  The Conference approved the following resolution concerning
indigent defendants in the District of Columbia, which was recom­
mended by the Committee:                                          .
          WHEREAS, the problem of assigning counsel in the Dis­
       trict of Columbia in criminal cases, mental health cases,
      habeas corpus cases, cases arising under Section 2255, Title
       28, United States Code, and in cases of juveniles charged with
       delinquency, has reached a critical state; and
          WHEREAS, the courts do not have the power to set up an
      adequate system to provide for the proper representation of
     the aforesaid persons; and                     .
          WHEREAS, it appears that legislation is essential in order
       to provide an adequate system;
          NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that it is the sense
       of the Judicial Conference of the United States that it is
       essential that legislation be obtained providing for the repre­
       sentation of indigent persons in courts of the District of
       COlumbia, and, therefore, Congress is urged to enact legisla...
    . ·tion to provide for such representation; that such legislation
   . should be in such broad terms as to provide for the repre­
      sentation of the indigent in criminal, mental health, habeas
       corpus cases and cases arising under Section 2255, Title 28;
       United States Code, and further that such legislation should
       apply to the United States Court of Appeals, the United
      States District Court for the District of Columbia, the Mu­
       nicipal Court and the Juvenile Court. It is recommended
       that said legislation be in one or the other of the following
       forms:
          (a) Provide a public defender, together with the necessary
      assistants, for the District of. Columbia, the public defender
      to be authorized to encourage help by volunteers; or
          (b) That a system of appointed counsel be authorized and
      an appropriation be made, to the end that the court might
      assign counsel to represent the indigent in the class of cases
      ,a,foresaid and to pay counsel compensation not to exceed a
       certain amount.
                                36 

                      APPROPRIATIONS 

   The estimates of supplemental appropriations submitted by the "
Administrative Office pursuant to the statute (28 United States
Code 605) were approved for the fiscal years 1958 and 1959.
   The estimates include additional funds for the appropriation
items covering the salaries of supporting personnel of the courts
and the Administrative Office which will be required if 'pending
legislation to authorize salary increases to government personnel
generally is enacted; additional funds for the employment of a
pretrial examiner and necessary assistants in the District of
Columbia as approved by the Conference at this session; and an
item of $49,000 for the fiscal year 1959 to provide funds for the
payment of counsel to represent indigent persons alleged to
be insane in the District of Columbia if the pending request for
additional funds for this item for the fiscal year 1958 is approved.
                     COURT REPORTERS
   The Assistant Director, Mr. Ellis, reported to the Conference
that a number of requests had been received from district judges
that the salaries of specific court reporters be increased. Upon
the recommendation of the Administrative Office, the combina­
tion position of court reporter-probation clerk in the District of
Vermont and the combination position of court reporter-law
clerk-secretary in the District of Montana were separated and a
new position of court reporter at a salary of $5,375 per annum
was authorized for each district.
   The Conference by mail vote in January 1958 had authorized
the separation of the position of court reporter-secretary in the
District of Maine, and upon the recommendation of the Admin­
istrative Office the salary for this position was now fixed at
$5,915 per annum.
   Upon the further recommendation of the Administrative Office,
the Conference authorized an increase in the salary of the court
reporters in the following districts from $5,375 per annum to
$5,915 per annum; the Southern District of Florida (including
the reporter of the Judge appointed to serve both the Northern
and Southern Districts of Florida), the Middle District of Georgia,
the Northern District of Iowa, and the Eastern District of Tennes­
see. In the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the reporters
                                           37
           by local rule of the district court are not permitted to engage in
(          private reporting, the Conference authorized an increase in the
           salary of the court reporters from $5,915 per annum to $6,450
           per annum.
              The Conference concurred in a recommendation of the Ad­
           ministrative Office that no changes be made at the present time
           in the salaries of the court reporters in the Northern District of
           Georgia, the Western District of Texas and the District of
           Minnesota.
              Chief Judge Hutcheson brought to the attention of the Con­
           ference the request of Chief Judge T. Hoyt Davis of the United
           States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for the
           separation of the position of court reporter-secretary assigned to
           him. . Authority was granted to the Committee on Supporting
           Personnel to consider the proposal and take any action thereon,
           including the establishment of a new position of court reporter
           and fixing the salary thereof.

                                   PHILLIPS PLAN
             On a motion of Chief Judge Magruder the Conference adopted
           the following resolution:
                   Resolved, That, in view of the fact that representative dis­
                trict judges now sit as members of the Judicial Conference of
                the United States pursuant to Section 331 of Title 28, United
                States Code, as amended, the Conference hereby rescinds its
                action taken at its September 1945 session (Conf. Rept., 1945,
                p. 7), that the Judicial Conference should take no definite
                action and make no recommendation with respect to any re­
                port of a committee and any drafts of bills, affecting the dis­
                trict judges or the district courts until the procedure pre­
                scribed by the Conference at that session (commonly known
                as the Phillips plan) had been complied with for submitting
                such reports of committees, drafts of bills or other proposals
                to committees of the circuit conferences, to the circuit con­
                ferences and to all the district judges.     .

           SECRETARY-LAW CLERK TO CIRCUIT JUDGE ALLEN
              The Director, Mr. Olney, presented to the Conference the ques­
           tion of the proper salary classification of the secretary-law clerk
    .. )
                                38 

to Circuit Judge Allen. The request of Judge Allen that her sec­

            CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER SUBMISSION
r      The Administrative Office submitted to the Conference a report
    concerning cases under submission in the courts of appeals and
    eases and motions under advisement in the district courts. The
    report listed 10 cases and motions which had been under advise­
    ment in the district courts more than 6 months on March 1, 1958.
    Where necessary, these will be brought to the attention of the
    circuit council by the Chief Judge of the circuit.
      The Conference adopted the following resolution and then de­
    clared a recess subject to the call of the Chief Justice:
            The Judicial Conference of the United States assembled at
         Washington, D. C., has learned with profound sadness of the
         death of Chief Judge John J. Parker of the Fourth Judicial
         Circuit of the United States. Chief Judge Parker was dis­
         tinguished for ability and integrity of the highest order, and
         his wise counsel was of inestimable value in the deliberations
         of this body of which he was for many years the Senior mem­
         ber. His creative leadership in advancing judicial adminis­
         tration has been excelled by none. Judge Parker's opinions
         contributed and will continue to contribute great and lasting
         value to American jurisprudence. To this Nation and to
         his native State of North Carolina, he brought honor by his
         exceptional courage, devotion, and wisdom.
           The members of this Conference express their deep sym­
         pathy to his family and to his colleagues.
            Be it resolved, That the Conference stand adjourned in
         honor of his memory.
            For the Judicial Conference of the United States.

                                                EARL WARREN,
                                                      Chief Justice.
      MAY   29, 1958.
