Charles C. Simons who has relinquished the office of Chief Judge
for the Sixth Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 45(c). Thereupon
the Conference adopted the following resolution:
        Through his relinquishment of the office of Chief Judge for
     the Sixth Circuit, our colleague, Charles Casper Simons, has
     yielded his membership on the Judicial Conference of the
     Uni ted States which he has held for six years.
        Judge Simons is a judge of long and ripe experience, having
     served with distinction as.a district judge of the United States
     District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for nearly
     9 years and as a judge of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
     Circuit for more than 26 years. To the affairs ofthis Confer­
     ence, he brought sound judgment and wisdom grounded in 8
     deep learning of the law. His counsel will be very much
     missed.
                                                                           o

        Throughout his distinguished career, Judge SimOns has
     been held in affectionate regard by the judges of his own
     court, the members of the bar of his circuit, and by the mem­
     bers of this Conference. We extend our every good wish for
     his health and happiness and the strength to continue his
     judicial service for many years to come.
  The Conference also welcomed District Judges George C.
Sweeney, Roszel C. Thomsen, Seybourn H. Lynne, Paul Jones,

     District of Washington, was recently killed in an automobile
     accident, now therefore be it resolved that this Conference
     profoundly regrets the passing of Judge Driver and by a

        REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
  The Attorney General of the United States presented a re­
port to the Conference on matters relating to the business of the
courts of the United States. The report appears in the appendix.
REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
  The first annual report of Warren Olney III, Director of the
Administrative Office, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1958 had
been submitted previously to the members of the Conference pur­
    498084:--4'19-2
                                  4


suant to 28 U.S.C. 604(a)(3). The Conference approved the
immediate release of the report for pUblication and authorized the
Director to revise and supplement it in the final printed edition        )
to be issued later.
   Mr. Olney addressed the Conference briefly and outlined some
current problems facing the federal judiciary. He explained the
new organization in the Administrative Office which is designed
to enable the Director to carry out his statutory duties and to
undertake any new duties with respect to the study of the rules
of practice and procedure that may be assigned to him by the
Conference.
   State of the dockets of the Federal courts-Courts of appeals.­
Cases filed in the United States courts of appeals during the fiscal
year 1958 numbered 3,694, about the same as last year. There
were 3,704 cases terminated during the year and 2,033 cases re­
mained for disposition on June 30, 1958. Only a slight variation
in the backlog of pending cases in the courts of appeals has ap­
peared during the last five years. The median time interval from
filing of the complete record to final disposition of cases terminated
after hearing or submission in all the courts of appeals in 1958
was 7.0 months compared with 7.1 months in 1957 and 7.4 months
in 1956. The judges in the Second, Fourth and Fifth Circuits
continue to be overburdened, having caseloads substantially in
excess of the national average.
   District courts.-The United States district courts experienced,
during the fiscal year 1958, the heaviest workload in their history.
They entered the fiscal year with 62,338 civil cases and 7,495
criminal cases pending and an additional 67,115 civil cases and
28,897 criminal cases were filed during the year. Terminations
of civil cases in fiscal 1958 were 61,285, leaving a backlog of
68,168 civil cases, and terminations of criminal cases were 28,994
leaving 7,451 outstanding.
   A new high record of private civil cases pending, 51,962, was
established on June 30, 1958. The figure was 5,089 greater than
a year ago. This is important because the cases between private
parties are much more burdensome on the average than govern­
ment cases, and are the cause of much of the congestion and
delay.
   The median time interval from filing to disposition of civil
cases tried continued at a high level of 13.9 months in 1958 com­
                                            5
          pared with 14.0 months in 1957, and the interval from filing to
          trial was 11.9 months compared to an interval of 12.0 months
          last year. Nearly 40 percent of the civil cases which reached
          trial in 1958 had been delayed from 1 to 4 years after issue had
          been joined. In fact, only in 7 districts have at least half of the
          civil cases reached trial within 6 months of filing, as recommended
          by the Judicial Conference.
             Further contributing to the workload of the district courts has
         been a marked increase in the volume of filings in bankruptcy,
         particularly those involving individual wage earners. Wage earn­
         ing employees and other nonbusiness debtors were responsible
         for 80,264 nonbusiness filings in 1958, or 87.6 percent of the bank­
         ruptcy business of the courts. Business filings were 11,404, or
         12.4 percent of the bankruptcy business. Total filings during
         fiscal 1958 amounted to 91,668 cases as compared with 73,761
         in fiscal 1957, an increase of 24.3 percent. There were 79,681 bank­
         ruptcy proceedings terminated during the year and 80,446 were
         pending on June 30, 1958.
                     EXPEDITION OF COURT BUSINESS
             The Conference received reports from the Court of Claims and
    (;    from the Chief Judges of the respective circuits concerning the
          state of their dockets and the need for additional judicial assist­
          ance.
             The Committees on Court Administration and Judicial Statis­
          tics reported that, despite strong representations by the Attorney
          General, Committees of the Conference and the Administrative
          Office, no action was taken during the 85th Congress to provide
          the 45 additional judgeships recommended by the Conference.
             The Conference discussed, in this connection, the probable ef­
          fects of the Act of August 25, 1958 [P.L. 85-554] increasing the
          jurisdictional amoruit in Federal question and diversity of citizen­
         ship cases from $3,000 to $10,000, making a corporation a citizen
         for diversity jurisdiction purposes not only of the State of in­
         corporation but also of the State where it has its principal place
         of business, and prohibiting the removal of Workmen's Compensa­
         tion cases from State courts to Federal courts. It was agreed
         that, from a practical standpoint, the effects of the Act on the
         volume of new filings could not be immediately determined. With
         respect to additional judgeships, it was decided that there is not
(
                                 6

enough known about the effects of the Act to warrant altering
the recommendations of the Conference. The Committees on
Court Administration and J udieial Statistics were directed to main­
tain a continuous appraisal of the effects of the Act and report
again in March to the Conference.
   In the meantime, the Conference reiterated its view that the
creation of additional judgeships is vital to the prompt and effi­
cient administration of justice and that action must be sought
in the 86th Congress.

  RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR THE 

            UNITED STATES COURTS 

  Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
Court Administration, and Circuit Judge Albert B. Maris, Chair­
man of the Committee on Revision of the Laws, submitted to the
Conference the joint recommendations of their respective Com­
mittees for implementing the Act of July 11, 1958 (Public Law
85-513; 28 U.S.C. 331). This Act authorizes the Judicial Con­
ference of the United States to carryon.a continuous study of the
operation and effect of the general rules of practice and procedure
now or hereafter in use as prescribed by the Supreme Court for the     ()
other courts of the United States pursuant to law.
   After a full discussion the Conference approved the following
recommendations of the Committees:
   (1) That a standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Pro­
cedure be created, the members to be appointed by the Chief
Justice and to consist in addition to members of the Judicial Con­
ference of a suitable number of representative judges, lawyers and
law teachers.
   (2) That five advisory committees be created, one on practice
and procedure in civil cases; one on practice and procedure in
criminal cases; one on practice and procedure in bankruptcy; one
on rules of practice and procedure to be applicable to or govern
in admiralty c.ases; and one to recommend general uniform rules
of practice and procedure in the courts of appeals and rules gov­
erning review. of Tax Court decisions, the members of the ad­
visory committees to be appointed by the Chief Justice for terms
of four years, the first appointments to be for staggered terms of
tWQ and four years, the members to be eligible for reappoint­

                                                                        )
                                       7
      ment for one additional term only, and the members to consist
(,'
i
      of broadly representative judges, lawyers and law teachers.
          (3) The function of the standing Committee on Rules of Prac   w



      tice and Procedure shall be to coordinate the work of the several
      advisory committees, to make suggestions to them of proposals to
      be studied by them, to consider proposals recommended by the
      advisory committees and to transmit such proposals with its rec­
      ommendation to the Judicial Conference or to recommit them to
      the appropriate advisory committee for further study and consid   w




      eration, and to make recommendations to the Judicial Conference
      with regard to any other matters in the field of practice and pro­
      cedure as to which the Conference may be called upon to act.
          (4) Each of the advisory committees shall carryon a continuous
      study of the operation and effect of the rules of practice and pro­
      cedure now or hereafter in use in its particular field, and shall
      consider, and from time to time propose to the Judicial Confer­
      ence through the standing Committee on Rules of Practice and
      Procedure, such changes in and additions to those rules as the ad­
      visory committee may deem desirable to promote simplicity in
      procedure, fairness in administration, the just determination of
      litigation, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.
          (5) To assist the committees in carrying out their duties a re­
      porter and such associate or .assistant reporters as may be neces­
      sary should be appointed by the Chief Justice for limited terms of
      service and at adequate salaries. Supporting staff for the work
      of the reporter and of the committees should be provided by the
      Administrative Office.
          (6) Steps should be taken to encourage the judicial confer­
      ences and councils of the circuits to cooperate through suitable
      committees in each circuit, and similar steps should be taken in
      respect to securing the cooperation of national, state and local
      bar associations.

      JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORTING
        PERSONNEL AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT
        ADMINISTRATION
         Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
      Supporting Personnel and of the Committee on Court Adminis­
      tration, made a joint report for the two Committees.
                                  8
           Maintenance and Travel Expenses of Judges.
   Chief Judge Biggs reported that H.R. 3369, 85th Congress,'
 to increase the maximum reimbursement for subsistence expenses
allowable to judges on travel status from $15 to $25 per day,
approved by the Conference at its March 1957 session (Conf.
Rept. p. 7), had passed the House in a form substantially differ­
ent from that recommended by the Conference. It would have
authorized a per diem allowance for judges in lieu of actual ex­
penses of subsistence at the per diem rate provided for government
employees generally by the Travel Expense Act of 1949, as
amended, or, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
Director of the Administrative Office with the approval of the
Judicial Conference of the United States, reimbursement for ac­
tual expenses of subsistence not in excess of $25 per day.
   Upon the recommendation of the Committees the Conference
approved the following draft of a bill which is substantially similar
to that which passed the House at the last session of Congress:
   A BILL Relating to the maintenance and travel expenses of judges
       Be it enacted by the Senate and Home of Represenatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
    the first paragraph of Section 456 of Title 28, United States     )
    Code, is amended to read as follows:            '
       ''Each Justice or Judge of the United States and each
    retired Justice or Judge recalled or designated and assigned
    to active duty, while attending court or transacting official
    business at a place other than his official station, shall be
    paid by the Director of the Administrative Office of the
    United States Courts all necessary traveling expenses, and
    also a per diem allowance in lieu of actual expenses of sub­
    sistence (as defined in the Travel Expense Act of 1949, as
    amended, 63 Stat. 166, 5 U.S.C. 835) at the per diem rate
    provided for by the Travel Expense Act of 1949, as amended, .
    Of, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Director
    of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with
    the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States,
    reimbursement for his actual expenses of subsistence not in
    excess of $25 per day."

                                                                      \
                                                                      }
                                  9
                         Crier Law Clerks
   The Committees called attention to the action of the Confer­
ence at its March 1958 session (Conf. Rept. p. 8) recommending
that the appropriation proviso with respect to the employees of
a judge be expanded so as to include criers and messengers ap­
pointed by a judge along with secretaries and law clerks, and that
the maximum allowance for each judge be increased by the amount
of the base pay of a crier, which was then $3,415.
   In order to bring the resolution adopted by the Conference in
March 1956 (Conf. Rept. p. 7) with respect to the compensation
of secretaries and law clerks of judges into conformity with the
new recommendation of the Conference and the increased rates
of compensation provided for by the Federal Employees Salary
Increase Act of 1958, the Conference adopted the following
resolution:
        Resolved, That the compensation of secretaries and law
     clerks of circuit and district judges shall be fixed by the Di­
     rector of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
     without regard to the Classification Act of 1949, as amended,
     except that the salary of a secretary shall conform with that'
     of the General Schedule grades (OS) 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, as
     the appointing judge shall determine, and the salary of a
     law clerk shall conform with that of the General Schedule
     grades (OS) 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12, as the appointing judge
     shall determine, subject to review by the Judicial Conference
     of the United States if requested by the Director, such deter­
     mination by the judge otherwise to be final: Provided, That
     (exclusive of step increases corresponding with those provided
     for by title VII of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended,
     and of compensation paid for temporary assistance needed
     because of an emergency) the aggregate salaries paid to secre­
     taries and law clerks appointed by one judge and to the crier
     appointed by or the messenger assigned to him shall not ex­
     ceed $18,590 per annum, except in the case of the chief judge
     of each circuit and the chief judge of each district court having
     five or more judgeships, in which case the aggregate salaries
     shall not exceed $23,570 per annum.
                                 10
      Further resolved, That this resolution shall supersede the
    resolution upon the same subject matter which was adopted
    by the Judicial Conference at its special session in March
    1956.
                 Personnel of the Court of Claims
   The Conference at its March 1958 session (Conf. Rept. p. 6)
directed the Committee on Supporting Personnel to reconsider the
classification of secretaries to commissioners of the Court of
Claims. Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Administrative Office
had recommended to the Committee that the positions of the sec­
retaries to the commissioners of the Court of Claims be classified
in grades GS 7, GS 8 and GS 9 in accordance with the minimum
qualification standards submitted to the Committee and set forth
in the Committee's report. Upon the recommendation of the
Committee the Conference approved the salary grades and quali­
fication standards as submitted.
   At the request of Judge Whitaker the Conference referred to the
Committee on Supporting Personnel the recommendation of the

                        Probation Officers                                 )

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Committees had considered
carefully the proposal to reclassify the Chief Probation Officer in
the Northern District of Illinois, who also acts as director of the
Federal Probation Officer Training School, from grade GS 14 to
GS 15 (Conf. Rept., March 1958, p. 5) and that it was the unani­
mous view of the Committees that the reclassification should be
made. The Conference approved this reclassification.
   The Committees reported that 17 additional probation officers
and 12 additional probation clerks will be required if the desirable
caseload of 85 cases per officer in the federal probation system is
to be maintained. Upon the recommendation of the Committees,
the Conference directed that sufficient funds to employ this addi­
tional personnel be included in the Judiciary budget for 1960.
   Upon the recommendation of the Committees the Conference re­
affirmed its recommendation (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1957, p. 42) for
legislation to authorize the Judicial Conference to promulgate
minimum qualification standards to be met by all probation officers
appointed in the future.
                                                                       ,   )
                                                                           /
                                 11 


   The Committees reported that the Administrative Office had
studied the proposal to create five positions in the Probation Divi­
sion of the Administrative Office to provide regional supervision
and coordination of probation offices throughout the country
(Conf. Rept., March 1958, pp. 5-6), and had concluded that two
such additional professional positions should be created. Upon the
recommendation of the Committees, the Conference authorized the
creation of these two positions with supporting staff and directed
that the necessary funds be included in the Judiciary budget for
1960.
                         Court Reporters
   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Committees had studied
the results of tests of electronic recording devices conducted by
the Administrative Office in actual trials in certain districts, and
that the Committees were of the view that these machines offer
the possibility of substantial aid in the conduct of trials. It was
the view of the Administrative Office that further tests of re­
cording machines should be made, and upon the recommendation
of the Committees the Conference authorized the Administra·
tive Office to select typical district courts and to make use of
electronic recording devices in the conduct of actual trials in
those courts, the court reporter also being present and function­
ing as usual, and to report back to the Committees and to the Con­
ference at some future time in respect to their use.
   The Committees further reported that in their study of the
work and the compensation of court reporters there has been fre­
quent reference to the burden placed upon the reporters by the
requirement in 28 U.S.C. 753 that all pleas and proceedings in
connection with the imposition of sentence in criminal cases be
transcribed and certified. Information received from the clerks
of the district courts by the Administrative Office shows that this
requirement of transcribing and filing in the clerks' offices the
arraignments, pleas and sentences is frequently not complied
with. In the opinion of the Committees, it is almost impossi·
ble for reporters in busy district courts to fulfill this requirement
without a substantial increase in the number of reporters, and
that the need for a record in criminal cases is met by the present
requirement that reporters file their notes in each case. The Com­
mittees accordingly recommended that the provisions of 28 U.S.C.
    493034-59--8
                                                           12 

753 be amended to require the transcription of these proceedings
only when ordered by the district court or by an appellate court.
The Conference approved the recommendation of the Committees.
   It was the view of the Committees that the court reporters
who function very largely in rural areas receive insufficient com­
pensation in view of the hours of work, time spent in traveling,
and the small opportunity to increase their earnings above their
sttlaries through the sale of transcripts. The Committees, there­
fore recommended that the three salary classifications of court re­
porters established by the Conference be abolished, and that the
court reporters hereafter be classified in two classes as Umetropoli­
tan area" reporters at a salary of $7,095 per annum, and
Hnonmetropolitan area" reporters at a salary of $6,505 per annum,
respectively, and that this change, which will affect only those re­
porters who now receive less than $6,505 per annum, be made
effective as soon as appropriated funds are available. The Con­
ference approved the recommendation of the Committee, and di~
rected that the necessary funds be included in the Judiciary budget
for 1960.
   The Committees were also of the view that the maximum charge
permitted for daily transcript by court reporters should be in­
creased, since in delivering daily transcript a reporter ordinarily                                                  (j
must employ two additional reporters to assist him and usually
must employ two or three additional typists. Upon the recom~
mendation of the Committees, the Conference approved the fol­
lowing maximum charges per page for daily tran3cript which may
be fixed by the district courts up to the stated maximum under
28 U.S.C. 753(f).
                         Maximum Rates for Daily Transcripts
                                                                                Rst41 per pale

  The Conference adopted the following definition of the term
"daily transcript":
                                      13 

              The term 'daily transcript' is defined as that in which a
           transcript of each day's proceedings is delivered following ad­
           journment and prior to the normal opening hour of the court
           on the following morning whether or not it actually be a court
          day.
        The Conference approved a recommendation of the Committees
     that the Director of the Administrative Office be authorized to
     employ a management analyst to make a complete study of typical
     court and other reported systems, the courts or bodies to be
     surveyed to be left to the discretion of the Director.
        On recommendation of the Committees, the Administrative Of­
     fice was requested to study the matter of the quarterly reports
     now required of court reporters to the end that the reports may
     be simplified and, perhaps, required to be filed at less frequent
     intervals. The Committees also reported that they had been
     informed that on the quarterly reports required to be filed by the
     court reporters with the Administrative Office the item "Total
     net earnings" is computed on different bases by different reporters.
     In order that the Committees may have accurate information as
     to reporters' earnings for their use in arriving at an estimate as
     to what the compensation of reporters should be, the Conference
     directed the Administrative Office to send to eMh reporter a
     questionnaire as to the basis on which his total net earnings are
     reported.
        In accordance with the authority granted to it by the confer­
     ence to take action with respect to the court reporter-secretary
     assigned to Chief Judge T. Hoyt Davis in the Middle District
     of Georgia, including the establishment of a new position of court
     reporter and fixing the salary thereof (Coni. Rept. March 1958,
     p. 37), the Committees reported that the Administrative Office
     had been authorized to continue this combined court reporter­
     secretary position at a salary of $7,095 per annum, or toestab­
     lish a separate position of court. reporter at the rate of $6,505 per
     annum, as Judge Davis may elect. The action of the Committee
     w.as approved by the Conference.
        The Assistant Director of the Administrative Office had in­
     formed the Committees of an increasing use of temporary court
     reporting· services and that an additional sum of $20,000 will
     be required to provide such services. On the recommendation of
     the Committees, the Conference directed that this additional sum
(,
for temporary reporting services be included in the Judiciary
budget for 1960.
  The Conference approved a recommendation of the Committees            )
that in the event of a vacancy in the office of a district judge the
services of the reporter assigned to him be utilized in the same or
in some other district wherever this can be done to advantage.
  The Committee on Supporting Personnel, with the assistance
of the Committee on Court Administration, was authorized to
continue the study of the compensation of court reporters and
methods and means of reporting and transcription, with leave to
rep()rt to the Conference at a future meeting.
                     Deputy Clerks of Court
  At the request of the Committees, the Conference directed the
Administrative Office to make a study of the differences in duties
and responsibilities of deputy court clerks in charge of divisions
and to report to the Committees on Supporting Personnel and
Court Administration as to whether or not there should be grade
differentials in these positions and, if so, what they should be.
  At the further request of the Committees, the Administrative

~!: ~~::~::~s ~~tj~~g!~~s~~~:~!~: =e~ar;sd~~r::!                       ()
whether it would be feasible to include in these standards time
spent in study in institutions of higher learning as the equivalent
of years of practical experience.
   The Assistant Director of the Administrative Office had reported
to the Committees that additional deputy clerks would be re­
quired if the work of the clerks' offices was to be carried on ex­
peditiously and stated that the minimum number required was 20.
Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the Conference di­
rected that sufficient funds be included in the Judiciary budget for
1960 to provide for 20 additional deputy clerks.
                    Law Clerks and Secretaries
  The Assistant Director of the Administrative Office reported to
the Committees that in order to provide adequate staffs for judges
appointed to succeed retiring judges who were continuing to render
judicial service and who would, therefore, retain their staffs, an
estimated 11 additional law clerks or secretaries to judges will be
required during the next fiscal year. Upon the recommendation
                                15 

of the Committee the Conference directed that a sufficient sum for
this purpose be included in the Judiciary budget for 1960.
                             Law Clerks
   The Judicial Conference at its September 1957 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 12) directed the Committee on Supporting Personnel to
study possible revisions of the qualification standards for law
clerks. The Committee reported that it had requested the Ad­
ministrative Office to supply the data necessary for the considera­
tion of such a revision but that the necessary informative material
had not yet been submitted. The Committee was authorized to
consider this matter further and to report thereon at a future ses­
sion of the Conference.
       Uniform Rules of Evidence for the Federal Courts
   At the September 1957 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept.
p. 43), a proposal to establish uniform rules of evidence for the
federal courtS was referred by the Conference to the Committee
on Court Administration for study and report. In view of the
action of the Conference at this session establishing a Committee
on Rules of Practice and Procedure, the Committees recom­
mended that this subject, which involves rules of practice and
procedure, be referred to that Committee for consideration to the
end that it may be referred to an appropriate advisory commit­
tee if deemed proper. The Conference approved the recommenda­
tion of the Committee.
                      Conference Procedure
  In accordance with the recommendation of the Committees, the
Conference directed that reports of Conference Committees be
submitted to the Administrative Office for circulation, wherever
practicable, at least 20 days prior to the meeting of the Judicial
Conference at which they are to be considered.
Use of Per Curiam or Other Brief Opinions by Courts of Appeals
  The Committees recommended that the Conference suggest to
the Judicial Conferences of the several circuits that they include
in their agenda the subject of shortening the time required in the
disposition of cases by the courts of appeals thr()ugh the use ()f
per curiam and. other brief opinions in those cases in which they
                                 16 

are appropriate.    The recommendation was approved by the
Conference.                                                             ( ,
                   Printing Records on Appeal
   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Committees had discussed
the costs and delays involved in the continued use by some of the
courts of appeals of the system of printing the record on appeal
rather than portions thereof in an appendix to the brief. The
Committees recommended that this matter be referred to the
standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure to the
end that it may be referred to an appropriate advisory com­
mittee for consideration if deemed proper. Judge Orie L. Phil­
lips, with whom Chief Judge Hutcheson concurred, noted his dis­
agreement with the proposal because it implies that a system of
printing records on appeal involves costs and delays in all courts of
appeals that retain that system.
Cost of Living Allowances to JudiciaZ Employees in Territories
                       and Possessions                      .
   On recommendation of the Committees, the Conference reaf­
firmed its approval of the proposal contained in S. 3374 and H.R.
5801 of the 85th Congress (Conf. Rept., March 1958, p. 23) to           (

authorize cost-of-living allowances to judicial employees stationed
outside the continental United States or in Alaska.
                   United States Commissioner8
   Chief Judge Biggs reported that S. 3841, 85th Congress, to in­
crease the fees of United States Commissioners and S. 3842, 85th
Congress, to amend the Civil Service Retirement Act to provide
for the crediting of service of United States Oommissioners on
the basis of 1/238 of a year for each day's service instead of 1/330
of a year, as under the present retirement provisions enacted about
two years ago, had been referred to the Direct.or of the Adminis­
trative Office by the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary
of the United States Senate for the views of the Conference. The
Committees were of the opinion that since the fees of United
States Commissioners were increased recently by the Act of Sep­
tember 2, 1957, Public Law 85-276 and that the present retire­
ment provisions for the United States Commissioners have been
so recently enacted, no further increase in fees, or change in the
                                    17 

    provisions for retirement should be considered at this time. The
    Conference concurred in the views of the Committees.
                    Administrative Office Personnel
       Judge Biggs reported that the Committees had considered the
    proposal contained in S. 4142, 85th Congress, to provide for a
    change in the title of the Assistant Director of the Administra­
    tive Office to (lDeputy Director" and to provide two additional
    positions in the Administrative Office at grade GS 18. Upon the
    recommendation of the Committees, the Conference approved the
    proposal.
        Clerical Personnel of the United States Commissioner
                     in the District of Columbia
       The Conference, in accordance with the recommendation of the
    Committee, reaffirmed its approval of the proposal contained in
    H.R. 268, 85th Congress, (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1957, p. 27) which
    would provide that the salaries of the clerical assistants of the
    United States Commissioner in the District of Columbia shall be
    fixed by the Director of the Administrative Office instead of by
(   the District Court.
        ~ubpoena   Powers for Judicial Courteils of the Circuits
       Chief Judge Biggs reported that the proposal to provide sub­
    poena powers for the Judicial Councils of the circuits had been
    circulated among the circuit and district judges for an expression
    of views as directed by the Conference at its March 1958 session
    (Conf. Rept., p. 11). After further consideration the Commit­
    tees were of the view that the bill as submitted should be modi­
    fied so as to make it clear that it is not applicable to judges or
    other persons in the judicial establishment. After a full discus­
    sion, the Conference directed the Committees to reconsider the
    proposal in the light of the discussions in the Conference, and to
    consider, among other things, the present power of the Judicial
    Council to order a judge to report on any situation in his court.
        Private Practice of Law by Employees of the Judiciary
      The Conference upon the recommendation of the Committees
    adopted the following resolu tion :
                                 18
      Resolved, That no person employed on a full-time basis
    in the federal judicial establishment shall engage in the pri­
    vate practice of the law.
                  National Park Commissioners
                                                                       j
   The attention of the Conference wag directed to the fact that the
                                                                       .1
National Park Commissioners have not received the benefits of the
salary increase granted to federal employees generally by the Fed­
eral Employees Salary Increase Act of 1958, Public Law 85-462,
because pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 634 the salaries of these Commis­
sioners are fixed by each district court, with the approval of the
Judicial Conference. In order to give effect to the increase author~
ized for other judicial personnel generally, the Committee recom­
mended that the Conference approve the following maximum
salaries for National Park Commissioners:
   Class A-$5,950 per annum
       Rocky Mountain National Park
       Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks
       Yellowstone National Park
       Yosemite National Park
   Class B-$5,850 per annum
       Glacier National Park
       Mount Rainier National Park
   Class 0-$4,750 per annum
       Big Bend National Park
       Crater Lake National Park
       Lassen Volcanic National Park
       Mesa Verde National Park
       Olympic National Park
       Great Smoky National Park ($2,375 for each commissioner)
   Class 0-$8,250 per annum
       Mammoth Cave National Park
       Shenandoah National Park
       Cumberland Gap National Park' ($1,625 for each commissioner)
   Th~ district courts were authorized by the Conference to fix the
salaries of the National Park Commissioners within the above
limits pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 634 and to fix retroactive pay to the
extent permitted under the Federal Employees Salary Increase Act
of 1958.
             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

  Circuit Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
Bankruptcy Administration, reported that the Committee had
met and considered the recommendations contained in 'the report
                                                       19 

of the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office dated July
17, 1958, relating to changes in salaries and arrangements for ref­
erees and the filling of vacancies in referee positions.
   The report of July 17, 1958, was submitted by the Acting Di­
rector of the Administrative Office to the members of the Judi­
cial Conference and to the Judicial Councils and the district judges
of the circuits and districts concerned in accordance with the Bank­
ruptcy Act. The report, together with the views expressed by the
district judges and the circuit councils, was considered by the Com­
mittee.
   The Conference had before it the Committee's report, as well
as the recommendations of the Acting Director, the circuit coun­
cils and the district judges, and on the basis of these reports took
the action shown in the following table relating to changes in sal­
aries and arrangements:
                                                                                            Conference action

  Supplemental Appropriation for 1959 for Referee8' Expenses
   The Committee reported that the number of bankruptcy cases is
continuing to increase rapidly and that approximately 107,000
cases are now anticipated for the fiscal year 1959. The present
l1Ppropriation for referees' expenses in the amount of $2,625,550
was based on an estimated volume of 95,000 new cases. The Com­
mittee recommended that the DirectDr be authorized to seek a sup­
plemental appropriation for 1959 not to exceed $351,735. The
Conference approved this recommendation.
  Appropriations for 1960 for Referees' Salaries and Expenses
   The appropriations for referees' salaries and expenses for 1960
are based on an estimate of 117,000 cases. The estimated amount
needed for referees' salaries is $2,106,500 and for referees' expenses
$3,580,000.
   The estimate for referees' salaries includes (1) the cost of salary
changes and additional positions approved at the present meeting
of the Judicial Conference for the full fiscal year 1960; (2) an
estimate of the amount needed to cover the salary changes and
new referee positions expected to be authorized at the March 1959
meeting of the Conference for the full fiscal year 1960 and (3)
an estimate of the amount needed for the equivalent of ten addi-            J
tional full-time referee positions at the maximum salary of $15,000
a year, expected to be authorized by the Judicial Conference to
handle the increased volume of cases in 1960.
   The estimate for referees' expenses is likewise based upon an
estimated volume of 117,000 new cases in 1960. It is needed to pay
the cost of clerical service in the referees' offices and for other items
of expense.
   Upon the recommendation of the Committee the above esti­
mates were approved by the Conference.
Cha1iges in Additional Charges for the Referees' Salary and
                       Expense Funds
  Judge Phillips stated that pursuant to Section 400(2) of the
Bankruptcy Act the Director had recommended that the schedule
of additional fees and charges for the referees' salary and expense
funds, approved by the Conference at its September 1956 session
(Conf. Rept., p. 26), be revised to distribute the charges for the
two funds more nearly in .accordance with the needs of each by
                                          23 

     increasing the charges for the Expense Fund and decreasing the
     charges for the Salary Fund. These changes would not affect the
     total charges for the two funds.
        The Committee informed the Conference that on June 30, 1958,
     the total surplus in the Referees' Salary Fund was estimated .at
     $4,207,000 and in the Expense Fund at $1,919,000, and that ex­
     penditures from the Referees' Expense Fund in 1958 had exceeded
     receipts by approximately $55,000. While the accumulated sur­
     plus in the salary fund is ample, the surplus in the expense fund is
     now considerably less than one year's expenditures.
        Upon the recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee, the
     Conference approved the following schedule of additional fees and
     charges recommended by the Director, to be effective as to all cases
     filed on or after October 1, 1958:
        FEES TO BE CHARGED IN ASSET, ARRANGEMENT AND WAGE­
           EARNER CASES FOR THE REFEREES' SALARY FUND

        One-half of one percent on net realization in straight bankruptcy cases
         with a minimum charge of $2.50 in each Asset and Nominal Asset case.
        One-half of one percent on total obligations paid or extended in Chapter
         XI cases.
        One-half of one percent upon payments made by or for the debtor in
(        Chapter XIII cases.

        CHARGES TO BE MADE IN ASSET, ARRANGEMENT AND WAGE­
           EARNER CASES FOR THE REFEREES' EXPENSE FUND

        Referees' expenses in Chapter XIII cases at $10 per case where the liabili­
         ties do not exceed $200, and at $15 per case in all other Chapter XIII
         cases.
        Two percent on the first $50,000 and one and one-half percent on the bal­
         ance of the net realization in straight bankruptcy cases with a minimum
         charge of $2.00 in each Asset and Nominal Asset case.
        One-half of one percent on total obligations paid or extended in Chapter
         XI cases.
        One-half of one percent upon payments· made by or for the debtor in
         Chapter XIII cases.

       Consolidation of the Referees' Salary Fund and the Referees'
                              Expense Fund
        The Committee reported that difficulty had been encountered
     in the past in keeping the referees' salary fund and the referees'
     expense fund in proper balance with relation to the expenditures
     from each fund, that the division of the filing feeS presently a11o­
e.   catedto each fund by statute is not in .accordance with the needs
                                 24 

of the bankruptcy system, and that the limitation in Section           i
40c(2) of the Bankruptcy Act that the schedule of additional           I

charges for the two funds shall not be so revised in any year          !
that the total estimated collections shall exceed by more than         I

10 percent the total collections in the preceding year has been
unrealistic in the light of the increase in the volume of cases
filed in recent years.
                                                                       ]
  .The Committee was of the view that the consolidation of the
two funds would simplify and reduce the work in the referees'
offices, the clerks' offices, the United States Treasury, the Appro­
priations Committees of Congress and several divisions of the
Administrative Office. Upon the recommendation of the Com­
mittee the Conference approved the proposal to consolidate the
two funds, and directed the Administrative Office to draft the
necessary legislation for submission to the next Congress.
                            Legislation
   The Conference on recommendation of the Committee re­
affirmed its approval of the proposals contained in the following
bills introduced in the 85th Congress and authorized the Admin­
istrative Office to secure· the introduction and to support the
enactment of bills of like nature in the next Congress:
   (1) H.R. 106 to amend Sections 2a, 11a, 14c and 17a of the
 Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 11a, 29a, 32c and 35a, to provide the
bankruptcy courts with clear statutory authority to determine the
effect of a discharge.
   (2) H.R. 5195 to amend Sections 1(29), 64a, 67b, 67c and 70c of

659(3) of Chapter XIII-Wage Earners' Plans---of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 1006(8) and 1059(3), to remove the present
limitation of $5,000 on earnings, thus making more persons eligi­
ble to file petitions under Chapter XIII, and to change the com­
missions of the trustees in Chapter XIII cases from a flat 5 percent
to not more than 15 percent.
   (5) H.R. 12186 to amend Sections 60b, 67e and 70e of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, n U.S.C. 96b, 107e and nOe, to give the bankruptcy
                                  25 

 courts summary jurisdiction in actions brought under these Sec­
 tions involving the recovery of preferences, the avoidance of liens
 and fraudulent transfers, and the trustee's title to property.
    The following bills introduced in the 85th Congress were sub­
 mitted to the Committee for consideration pursuant to a request
 received by the Administrative Office from the Judiciary Commit­
 tees of the Congress for an expression of views:
    (1) H.R. 10379 would amend Section 61 of the Bankruptcy

 bond or otherwise shall be required from bankruptcy depository
 banks to the extent that they are insured by the Federal Savings
 and Loan Insurance Corporation. This would merely grant the
 same protection to accounts so insured as is now granted to ac­
 counts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
    (2) H.R. 12217 would amend Section 77c(2) of the Bankruptcy
 Act, 11 U.S.C. 205c (2), relating to the reorganization of railroads
 engaged in interstate commerce by making the trustee in operating
 the business of the debtor subject to the lawful orders of state regu­
 latory bodies; and
    (3) S. 3245 would amend Section 64a(2) of the Bankruptcy
 Act, 11 U.S.C. 104a(2), to increase the maximum priority for wage
claimants for wages earned within three months prior to bank­
 ruptcy from $600 to $1500.
    The Committee was of the view that these three bills involve
 questions of public policy and that it should express no opinion on
them.. The proposal contained in H.R. 12217 has now become
 Public Law 85-824.
   The Committee reported that the following bills, sponsored by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, had been referred to the
Administrative Office by the House Judiciary Committee for an
expression of views:
    (1) H.R. 11586 would amend Section 208 of Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 608, to permit the Securities and Ex­
change Commission to take an appeal as of right in a Chapter X
proceeding if, upon petition to the court of appeals, leave to appeal
is granted. The Committee was of the opinion that the granting
of a right of appeal to the Commission in these cases is a matter
of public policy for the determination of the Congress, but that
 if such right of appeal is to be given, it should be limited to mat­
ters that have been presented by the Commission to the trial court
     and that it was of the opinion that they present matters of policy
    with respect to which the Committee should express no opinion:
        (1) H.R. 11585 would amend Sections 174, 179, 216(7) and
     221(2) of Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 574, 579,
    616(7) and 621(2), to reduce the number of votes required for the
     confirmation of a plan for the reorganization of a corporation from
    two-thirds of the number and amount of each class of creditors,
     to a simple majority as now required for the confirmation of a plan
    in Chapter XI cases.
        (2) H.R. 11589 would amend Section 216(11) of Chapter X of
    the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 616( 11), to provide that for a period
    of two years after a substantial consummation of a plan of corpo­
    rate reorganization, a disinterested trustee or his attorney shall not
    serve in a salaried position with, or as general counsel for the
    reorganized company.
       (3) H.R. 11590 would amend Section 393a(2) of Chapter XI
     (Arrangements) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 793a(2), relat­
    ing to exchanges or issuances of securities for claims against the
    debtor, pursuant to an arrangement under Chapter XI. The
    court does not have jurisdiction to pass upon any securities which
    are issued by the debtor unless they are issued at least partly
(   in exchange for creditors' claims. The Securities and Exchange
    Commission feels the issuance of these securities, where issued
    solely for cash, should be approved by it.
       (4) H.R. 11592 would amend Section 328 of Chapter XI (Ar­
    rangements) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 728, to authorize
    the judge, under certain circumstances, to transfer a proceeding
    from Chapter XI to Chapter X, when the court finds the pro­
    ceeding was improperly brought under Chapter XI.
       (5) H.R. 11593 would amend the definition of Hdebtor" in Sec­
    tions 306(3) and 323 of Chapter XI (Arrangements) of the Bank­
    ruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 706(3) and 723, to provide that for the
    purposes of Chapter XI a debtor shall not include a corporation
    if the securities of such· corporation are beneficially owned by 100
    or more persons, and to require a corporation filing a petition
    under Chapter XI to state affirmatively that it is not a debtor
    whose securities are beneficially owned by 100 or more persons.
                                 28
        Blanket Bonds for Referees and Other Personnel
   The Committee recommended the enactment of a bill prepared
by the Administrative Office pursuant to the direction of the Con­
ference at its March 1958 session (Conf. Rept., p. 21) to amend
subsections a, d, e, g, hand k, of Section 50 of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U.S.C. 78, to authorize the Director of the Administra­
tive Office to procure bonds for referees and their personnel at
government expense. The Conference approved the Committee's
recommendation.
 Improvements in Bankruptcy Procedures and Administration
   The Committee reported that it had considered the following
proposals for the improvement of bankruptcy procedures and
administration:
   (1) Automatic adjudication of all ordinary voluntary bank­
ruptcy cases.-The Committee was of the view that the filing of
a voluntary petition in ordinary bankruptcy cases should consti­
tute an adjudication in bankruptcy with the same force and effect
as if an order of adjudication had been entered by the court.
The Conference concurred in the view of the Committee and di­
rected the Administrative Office to prepare and transmit to Con­
gress the necessary statutory amendments to effect this change.
   (2) Entry of orders of reference by the clerk of the court.-The
Committee recommended an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act
to authorize the clerk of the court to enter orders of references
in all ordinary bankruptcy cases (voluntary or involuntary), in
proceedings under Chapter XI and in those under Chapter XIII,
unless the court shall by order or otherwise direct. The Com­
mittee also recommended that the official forms be amended so
as to provide a concise order of reference. The Conference ap­
proved the recommendations of the Committee.
   (3) Elimination of the oath on proofs of claim.-The Com­
mittee recommended that the statutory requirement that proofs
of claim be verified under oath be eliminated, and that in lieu
of that requirement there be set forth in the official proof of claim
the statement that any false material statement of fact in the
claim shall constitute a criminal offense. The Administrative
Office, through its Bankruptcy Division, was directed to draft
and present to the Conference the necessary statutory changes
and the necessary changes in the official proof of claim.
                                 29 

   (4) Eliminating paper work in the referees' offices.-The Com­
mittee called to the attention of the Conference the provisions of
Section 39a(9) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 67a(9), requiring
the sending to the clerk of the court "forthwith" all bonds filed
with and approved by referees, the originals of all orders of adjudi­
cation or dismissing petitions, and certified copies of all orders
made by referees granting, denying or revoking discharges and the
like. The Committee was of the view that considerable paper work
would be eliminated, both in the referees' offices and in the
offices of the clerks of court, if these papers would remain in the
referees' offices until the case is closed and then be transmitted to
the clerk of the court for permanent preservation. The Confer­
ence concurred in the view of the Committee and approved amend­
ing Section 39a(9) to effect this proposal.
   (5) Consolidation of orders appointing a trustee and approving
his b01U1.-The Committee reported that considerable work would
be saved in the referees' offices if Official Forms 20, 21 and 24 re­
lating to the appointment of a trustee and the approval of the
trustee's bond were consolidated. Upon the recommendation of
the Committee, the Conference approved the proposal.
   (6) Standing trustees for small ca.ses.-The Committee reported
that it had referred to the Administrative Office for further study
and report to the Committee the proposal to provide for a panel of
standing trustees to handle small cases.
   (7) Procedures in installment cases-General Order 35(4).­
The Committee informed the Conference that it had requested the
Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office to prepare the
necessary factual data with regard to changes in procedures in in­
stallment cases under General Order 35(4) and to present this
information to the new standing Committee of the Conference on
Rules of Practice and Procedure for the federal courts.
   (8) Payments in contemplation of bankruptcy.-The Commit­
tee reported a proposal to amend Section 60d of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U.S.C. 96, concerning the payment of money, transfer of
property, or the incurring of obligations to attorneys in contem­
plation of the filing of a petition by or against the debtor, and in­
formed the Conference that it had requested the Bankruptcy Divi­
sion of the Administrative Office to present to the Committee at its
next meeting a proposed amendment to meet this problem.
                                  30

  (9) Other Administrative Proposals.-The Committee informed
the Conference that it had disapproved the proposal to eliminate
the oath on bankruptcy schedules and the proposal to provide (
blanket bonds for receivers and trustees in bankruptcy cases.
                    Other Legislative Proposals
  The Committee reported that a number of proposals to change
substantive provisions of the Bankruptcy Act had been brought to
the attention of the Administrative Office, and that the Committee
had requested the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative
Office to study the proposals and report to the Committee at its
next meeting.
         Wage Earners' Petitions Under Chapter XIII
   The Committee reported that substantial progress has been
made in the effort to better acquaint the referees, petitioners in
bankruptcy, attorneys, credit associations and other like associa­
tions with Chapter XIII and the desirability of its use in appro­
priate cases. The Committee has requested the Bankruptcy Divi­
sion to continue its efforts along these lines.
                      Retirement of Referees
   Judge Phillips reported that the Committee had considered at
length various proposals for the compulsory retirement of referees
and had taken into account their term of office, salary, retirement
benefits, age for retirement, the number approaching retirement
age and the like. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference approved a statutory amendment to provide that no
referee appointed or re-appointed after the effective date of the
amendment may serve beyond his 75th birthday.
              Filling Vacancies in Referee Positions
  Judge Phillips reported that considerable time, effort and often
delay are involved in complying with Section 43b of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, 11 U.RC. 71b, with respect to the filling of vacancies
in the offices of referees resulting from death, resignation or retire­
ment. He pointed out that this is particularly true in connection
with a mail vote of the Judicial Conference approving the filling
of a vacancy, and that with the enlargement of the Conference,
greater delays would probably be encountered.
                                       31
        The Committee, therefore, recommended an amendment to Sec­
     tion 43b to provide that vacancies in the offices of referees in bank­
     ruptcy, may be filled without formal approval by the Conference
     where no change in salary or arrangements is recommended by the
     Director, the district judge or judges of the district concerned, or
     the circuit council of the circuit in which the vacancy occurs. The
     Conference approved this recommendation.
                     Appeals From Orders of Referees
      The Committee reported that it had studied the proposal to pro­
    vide direct appeals from the orders of referees in bankruptcy to
    the courts of appeals. Upon the recommendation of the Com­
    mittee, the Conference disapproved the proposal.
        REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
        Chief Judge Charles E. Clark, Chairman of the Committee on
     the Budget, reported that the estimates submitted by the Adminis­
     trative Office pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 605 for annual appropriations
     for the support of the courts for the fiscal year 1960 and supple­
     mental appropriations for 1959 had been reviewed by the Com­
I    mittee and approved. The Conference thereupon approved the
     budget estimates as submitted, subject to any changes which may
     be required by action taken by the Conference at this session.
       The supplemental estimates for 1959 include funds for the in­
    creased cost of personal services and related items pursuant to
     the Federal Employees Salary Increase Act and for additional per­
    sonnel to study rules of practice and procedure pursuant to Public
     Law 85-513; additional funds for fees of jurors and U.S. com­
    missioners; and additional funds for travel and miscellaneous ex­
    penses including additional funds for postage as the result of the
    recent increase in postal rates and for transcripts and printed
    records furnished to persons permitted to appeal in forma pauperis.
       The estimates for the annual appropriations for the operation of
    the courts during the fiscal year 1960 include additional funds for
    new positions in the courts and additional positions in the Admin­
    istrative Office to meet the demands of the courts and to undertake
    the continuing study of the Rules of Practice and Procedure in the
    United States Courts pursuant to Public Law 85-513; increases
    for personal services including within-grade promotions; increases
    in travel funds and other impersonal expenses for new personnel;
                               32 

and increases for other nonpersonal services including new furni­
ture and equipment and the increased cost of other commodities
used in the operation of the courts.
   The Administrative Office was authorized, subject to the ap­
proval of the Budget Committee and notification as soon as pos­
sible to all members of the Conference, to make necessary amend­
ments to the annual budget submission to the Congress and to
submit requests for supplemental appropriations to the Congress
as required.
           CRIMINAL LAW ADMINISTRATION
   Chief Judge F. Ryan Duffy made· an informal report to the
Conference on behalf of the Committee on the Administration of
the Criminal Law. He called attention to the action of the Con­
ference at its September 1957 session (Conf. Rept. p. 27) concur­
ring in the view of the Committee that there was no need for
legislation giving to a defendant sentenced to a term of imprison­
ment credit for time spent in jail prior to sentence, since according
to available information this is uniformly considered by district
judges in imposing sentence. Judge Duffy pointed out, however,
that no credit can be given where a mandatory sentence is required [~
under the statute and stated that the Committee will reconsider the "
proposal.
   At the request of Judge Phillips, the Committee was directed to
take up for consideration the proposals to redefine the term
"felony" and to permit the dismissal of an indictment following a
successful term of probation (Con£. Rept., Sept. 1957, p. 26).
   The Conference was informed that the National Legal Aid
Society had requested an opportunity to present its views in regard
to the proposal contained in S. 3275, 85th Congress, to authorize
grants to legal aid societies and other organizations providing free
legal services to indigent persons accused of crime in the federal
courts, which was disapproved by the Conference at its March 1958
session (Con£. Rept., p. 33). The proposal was referred to the
Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law to con­
sider the views of the National Legal Aid Society and to report to
the Conference.
   On motion of Chief Judge Edgerton, the Administrative Office
was requested to endeavor to implement existing legislation re­
specting assignment of counsel for persons who are before the
                                33 

Mental Health Commission of the District of Columbia.          (See
Conf. Rept., Sept. 1957, p. 16.)
         COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL STATISTICS
   Chief Judge Charles E. Clark, Chairman of the Committee on
Judicial Statistics, presented the report of the Committee. He
called attention to the great disparity in workloads among the
various courts and suggested the formulation of a procedure for the
assignment of judges outside of their circuits as a means of equal­
izing caseloads. The Conference discussed the matter fully, and
on motion of Chief Judge Biggs authorized the Chief Justice to
appoint a small committee of judges, who are members of the
Judicial Conference, to consider the question of the assignment and
designation of judges to serve outside of their own circuits.
   The Committee also presented the following resolution with
respect to the assignment of judges which was approved by the
Conference:
        Recommended that the Judicial Conference declare it
     to be the sense of the Conference that in requesting the des­
     ignation of visiting judges and in consenting to the desig­
     nation of judges for service in other circuits, chief judges
     and circuit councils charged with consenting to such trans­
     fers and chief judges charged with the making of certifi­
     cates of necessity may take such action whenever in the
     exercise of discretion they consider it to be for the benefit
     of the judicial system and are not limited solely to situa­
     tions of congested calendars or where an exchange of service
     may be anticipated.
   Chief Judge Clark reported that the Administrative Office is
now receiving monthly trial reports from the clerks of the dis­
trict courts showing the number of trials and pretrial confer­
ences by judge and the dates on which they are held, and that
a similar report as to the work of the courts of appeals is believed
by the Committee to be necessary in order to have more infor­
mation as to the service of individual judges and as to the serv­
ice of retired judges. On recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference authorized the Administrative Office to request the
clerks of the courts of appeals to furnish monthly reports show­
                                34

ing the name and docket number of each case heard and the
name of each judge hearing such case.
   The Conference disapproved the proposal of the Committee (
that the clerks of the district courts be requested to classify pre­
trial conferences in accordance with whether or not a pretrial
order was entered following the conference and to report the
number of cases in which the district judge has expressly entered
an order obviating the necessity for holding a pretrial confer­
ence.
   The Conference directed that the report of the Committee be
received and that it be circulated throughout the JUdiciary for
the information of the judges.
      REPORT OF THE COMMITIEE ON PRETRIAL
                           PROCEDURE
  Circuit Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Committee
on Pretrial Procedure, submitted the report of the Committee to
the Conference. He stated that there has been a continuing in­
crease in the use of pretrial procedure in the federal courts, and
that it was the sense of the Committee that Rule 16 F.R.C.P.,
should be amended to provide that a pretrial conference be used
in every civil case before trial except in extraordinary cases where   (,
the district judge expressly enters an order otherwise. The Com­
mittee believes this is necessary to insure more widespread use
of the pretrial conference.
  Judge Murrah reported that the group of judges appointed by
the Chief Justice to study pretrial procedure in protracted liti­
gation had conducted a seminar on protracted cases at Stanford
University similar to the one held at New York University last
year, but with a sQmewhat larger group of judges. A transcript
of the seminar at Stanford University will be printed in due course
and will be made available to all federal judges.
           OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  Chief Judge Harry E. Watkins, Chairman of the Committee
on the Operation of the Jury System, submitted the report of the
Qnnmittee.
                          Legislation
  Judge Watkins informed the Conference that the proposal to
permit the trial court in its discretion to allow additional per­
                                                                       (
                                 35 

emptory challenges to multiple plaintiffs in civil actions as well
as to multiple defendants, which was approved by the Conference
at its September 1956 session (Conf. Rept., p. 39), had passed
the Congress, but was vetoed by the President because of an
amendment relating to land condemnation cases placed on the
bill in the Senate. He stated that there had been no action on the
proposal to provide for a jury commission for each United States
district court, to regulate its compensation, to prescribe its duties,
and for other purposes, which has been advocated by the Judicial
Conference since 1943. At the suggestion of the Committee, the
Conference reaffirmed its approval of both proposals.
   Judge Watkins called attention to one provision of the jury com­
mission bill which would increase the compensation of jury com­
missioners from $5.00 to $10.00 per day with no limit on the num­
ber of days of service. The present provision for compensation of
$5.00 per day first appeared in the Appropriation Act of August
7, 1884. The Conference thereupon approved a draft of a bill
submitted by the Committee to increase the compensation of
jury commissioners from $5.00 to $10.00 per day and authorized
the Committee to take steps to secure its passage.
   The Committee reported that the following bills disapproved
by the Conference did not pass in the 85th Congress:
   (1) H.R. 262 to permit grand juries to employ counsel and
special investigators;
   (2) H.R. 817 and H.R. 348 to provide that in a civil case the
number of jurors required to constitute the jury and the number
who must agree for a valid verdict should be determined by the
law of the state in which the action is tried:
   (3) H.R. 511 to give any party the right to a trial by jury as to
just compensation in a land condemnation proceeding; and
   (4) H.R. 979 to require jurors to take an oath that they do not
advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States
by force or violence.
                    Handbook for Petit Juror8
   Following the withdrawal by the United States Court of Ap­
peals of the Seventh Circuit of its first opinion in United States v.
Gordon, criticizing the use of the Judicial Conference Handbook
for Petit Jurors in criminal cases, and the entry after a rehearing
in bane of a subsequent opinion, 253 F. 2d 173, the Committee
                                 36 

has redrafted the handbook to obviate any possible future chal­
lenges of this kind. The new edition will be made available to all
district judges far use in their courts, if they so desire.        (
                    Costs of the Jury System
   A report prepared by the Administrative Office on the costs af
the operatian of the jury system far the fiscal year ending June 30,
1958, similar to. reports prepared for previous years, was sub­
nutted to the Conference by the Cammittee. At the Committee's
request, the Conference authorized the report to be distributed
among the judges for their information to the end that jury costs
may be kept at the lowest level consistent with the efficient oper­
atian of the system.
                     The Selection of Jurors
   Judge Watkins reported that the task of the Committee in re­
vising the 1942 report of the Committee af the Judicial Conference
an the Selectian of Jurors has progressed with the assistance of
the Institute of Judicial Administration in New Yark and the
Administrative Office, and that the Committee is presently en­
gaged in writing its report. At the request of the Committee, the
Conference authorized the circulation of the preliminary draft of (
the report, as soon .as it is completed, to all circuit and district
judges for their suggestions and criticisms. The Committee plans
to. submit a final repart to. the Conference at its next regular annual
session.
    COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE LAWS
 . Circuit Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman, submitted the report
of the Committee on Revisian of the Laws an the following pro­
posals considered by the Committee:
  . (1) Arbitration procedure-judicial review of questions of
law.-H.R. 7577, 85th Cangress, would make a number af changes
in the arbitratian pracedure provided for by Title 9 of the United
States Code including a requirement that, unless waived, no final
award should be issued in a maritime arbitration until after the
arbitrators have submitted to the parties a statement in writing of
their proposed award and have offered the parties an opportunity
to specify and be heard in respect of any omissions, ambiguities or
                                                                       ('
                                 37 

errors claimed to exist in the terms of the proposed award. The
proposal would also require the arbitrators at any time before
final award in a maritime arbitration, if so directed by order of the
district court, to state for the decision of the district court any
question of law arising in the course of the arbitration, or to state
the award or part thereof in the form of a special case. The Con­
ference considered the proposal but postponed action thereon.
   (2) Elimination of the requirement that presidential prtocla­
mations be 1YUblished in the Statutes at Large.-S. 3492, 85th Con­
gress, recommended by the General Services Administration, would
reduce unnecessary printing by eliminating the present statutory
requirement that Presidential proclamations be published in the
Statutes at Large. The proclamations would continue to be pub­
lished in the Federal Register where they are readily available.
Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
proved the bilL
   (3) The proposal to amend Section ~~41 (b) of Title ~8 U.S.C.
so as to eliminate the requirement that the district courts hold
hearings on all applications for writs of habeas corpus transferred
to them by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof or any circuit
judge.-Chief Judge Duffy had suggested to the Committee that
many habeas corpus applications may be determined under exist­
ing law without formal hearing merely upon consideration of the
averments of the petition and the accompanying documents and
that the use of the word "hearing" in Section 2241(b) of Title 28
U.S.C. is unnecessary and results in imposing an unnecessary duty
upon the district court in many habeas corpus caseS. On motion
of Chief Judge Duffy, the Chief Justice was authorized to consti­
tute a Committee on Habeas Corpus to study this and other related
problems, including the proposed amendment to 28 U.S.C. 2254
with respect to habeas corpus applications by state prisoners.
   (4) Venue in tort actions in the district in which the act or omis­
8ion complained of occurred.-The proposal contained in H.R.
13171, 85th Congress, to permit a civil action on a tort claim to be
brought in the judicial district wherein the act or omission com­
plained of occurred is identical to S. 1000, 85th Congress, pre­
viously approved by the Conference. On the recommendation of
the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its approval of this
proposal. ­
                                  38
   The Committee reported that it is giving further consideration to
the following proposals referred to the Committee for further
study by the Conference at its March 1958 session:                      \
   (a) S. 1721 and H.R. 6085, 85th Congress, to provide that 

actions to enforce, enjoin, set aside or suspend orders of the Inter­ 

state Commerce Commission be brought by or against the Com­

mission rather than the United States, 

   (b) H.R. 10892, 85th Congress, to permit a civil action to be 

brought against an officer or agency of the United States in any 

judical district where the plaintiff resides, and 

   (c) an amendment to the uniform rules of the courts of appeals 

on the review of agency orders proposed by' the Committee on 

Judicial Administration of the Federal Bar Association to shorten 

the time required to perfect review proceedings. 

 JOINT REPORT OF THE COMITTEES ON COURT AD­

    MINISTRATION AND REVISION OF THE LAWS 

   Circuit Judge Albert B. Maris, submitted the following report on
matters of legislation jointly considered by the Committees on
Court Administration and Revision of the Laws:
   (1) Transfer of the Tax Court to Title $8, United States Code, (
as a Constitutional court.-S. 3796, 85th Congress, would provide ~
for the transfer of the statutory provisions for the Tax Court from
the Internal Revenue Code to Title 28 of the United States Code,
transforming it from its present legal status as an independent
agency in the Executive Branch of the Government to that of a
Constitutional court in the Judicial Branch of the Government.
After a full discussion, the Conference voted to return the proposal
to the Committees for further study.
   (2) Creation of a United States Labor Court and a United
State8 Trade Court.-S. 3797 and S. 3798, 85th Congress, would
create administrative courts to take over certain jurisdiction pres­
ently exercised by the National Labor Relations Board and by the
Federal Trade Commission and certain other agencies, respectively.
After a full discussion, the Conference voted to disapprove both
bills.
   (3) Judicial review under the Civil Aeronautics Act.-S. 3782:
and H.R. 12461, 85th Congress, which have bee.n proposed by the
Civil Aeronautics Board, would amend the Civil Aeronautics Act
to (1) assure for the Civil Aeronautics Board independent partici­
                                39 

pation and representation in court proceedings, (2) provide for
review of nonhearing Board determinations in the courts of ap­
peals, and (3) clarify present provisions concerning the time for
seeking judicial review. The Conference postponed action on this
proposal until the views of the Department of Justice with respect
thereto could be ascertained.
   (4) Taxation of costs in actions for the recovery of Internal
Revenue taxes.-S. 3875 and H.R. 12664, 85th Congress, proposed
by the Department of Justice, would amend Section 2412(b) of
Title 28, United States Code, to extend the scope of that Section
to allow certain costs to the prevailing party in actions brought
against the Collector or Director of Internal Revenue, a former
Collector or Director, or the personal representative of a deceased
Collector or Director for the recovery of Internal Revenue taxes, as
well as in an action against the United States for the recovery of
Internal Revenue taxes alleged to have been improperly collected,
if the United States puts in issue the plaintiff's right to recover.
The Conference, on recommendation of the Committees, approved
the proposal.
   (5) Official station of a retired judge for travel expense pur­
poses.-The Committees called attention to 28 U.S.C. 374 which
exempts retired judges from restrictions as to residence appli­
cable to judges in regular active service. Nonetheless the official
station of a retired judge for purposes of determining his right
to be reimbursed for travel expenses when engaged in judicial
service away from home is fixed in the same manner as in the
case of a judge in regular active service. The official station of
a judge in regular active service, 28 U.S.C. 456, is stated to be
itthat place where a district court is regularly held and at or near
which the judge performs a substantial portion of his judicial
work, which is nearest the place where he maintains an actual
abode in which he customarily lives." The Committees were of
the view that the place where a retired judge maintains an "actual
abode in which he customarily lives" should be treated as his
official station for the purposes of the allowance of travel and
subsistence expenses, so that there may be no question as to his
right to reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses when
he serves under an assignment to active judicial 'duty at a place
away from his home. Upon the recommendation of the Com­
                                        40 

    mittees, the Conference approved the following draft of a bill to
    amend 28 U.S.C. 374:
         A BILL To fix the official station of retired judges assigned to active (
          duty
           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
        of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
        Section 374 of Title 28 of the United States Code is amended
        to read as follows:
        "374. Residence of retired judges; officialstaticm
           Retired judges of the United States are not subject to re­
        strictions as to residence. The place where a retired judge
        maintains the actual abode in which he custo~ly lives shall
        be deemed to be his official station for the purposes of Section
        458 of this Title."
           SEC. 2. Item 374 in the analysis of Chapter 17 of Title 28
        of the United States Code, immediately preceding Section
        371 of such title, is amended to read as follows:
           "374. Residence of retired judges; official station."
       The Conference, on recommendation of its Committees on
    Court Administration and Revision of the Laws, reaffirmed its
    approval of the following legislative proposals:                  (
       (1) That the salary of the Director of the Administrative .
    Office be set at $22,500 per annum and the salary of the Assist­
    ant Director at $20,000 per annum;
       (2) That district judges be authorized to employ law clerks
    and secretaries in the same manner as they are employed by cir­
    cuit judges;
       (3) That the judges of the circuit courts of the Territory of
    Hawaii be included in 28 U.S.C. 373 for purposes of retirement;
       (4) That probation' officers be afforded the protection pro­
    vided by the statute making it a crime to harm a federal officer;
       (5) That the assignment of a retired territorial judge to ac­
    tive duty be authorized, provided he is not engaged in the pri­
    vate practice of law;
       (6) That all federal judges and libraries of the courts of ap­
    peals be provided with copies of the Congressional Record free
    of charge, when requested;
       (7) That reasonable notice (rather than the mandatory five­

                                                                                (

     day notice, as at present) be given to an administrative agency
     of applications to the courts of appeals for interlocutory relief;
        (8) That life tenure be provided for the district judges in Ha­
     waii and Puerto Rico;
       (9) That the transfer of cases between the Court of Claims
     and the district courts be authorized; and
        (10) That reviews of judgments of the Supreme Court of
     Puerto Rico go directly to the Supreme Court of the United States
     rather than the United States Court of Appeals for the First Cir­
     cuit.
       These proposals are in addition to those listed in the various
     committee reports, which the Conference also reaffirmed.
                            COURT REPORTERS
       The Director presented to the Conference the requests for in­
     creases in salaries of court reporters received from individual
     courts by the Administrative Office. In accordance with the pre­
     vious action of the Conference at this session 1 the salaries of the
     court reporters in the districts of Arizona, Kansas, the Western
     District of North Carolina, the Western District of Oklahoma, the
(	   Middle and Western Districts of Tennessee, and Vermont will be
     increased from $5,915 per annum to $6,505 per annum as soon as
     appropriated funds are available. The further requests for in­
     creases in the salaries of the court reporters in Arizona, the North­
     ern District of Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, the Western District
     of Oklahoma, the Western District of Tennessee and the Western
     District of Texas were referred to the Director of the Adminis­
     trative Office for study and report to the Conference at its next
     session.
                JUDIOIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY SYSTEM
        The Director, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 605, providing that
     a periodic examination of the Judicial Survivors Annuity Fund be
     made by an actuary, submitted to the Conference a report of an
     e~amination prepared as of June 30, 1958, by the offi~ of the
     Government Actuary, Department of the Treasury. The Con­
     ference authorized the Chief Justice to appoint a standing Com­
     mittee of the Conference on the Judicial Survivors' Annuity Sye­

tem, the report of the Actuary to be referred to the Committee
for study and later report to the Conference.
  PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS OF
  APPEALS OF THE EIGHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS

   At the request of Chief Judge Gardner the Conference, pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that terms for the Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be pretermitted
during the current fiscal year.
   At the request of Chief Judge Bratton, the Conference con­
sented that terms of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
at places other than Denver be pretermitted during the current
fiscal year.

  RULES FOR THE REVIEW OR ENFORCEMENT OF 

     ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES 

   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit submitted to the
Conference for approval, pursuant to the provisions of the Act of
December 29, 1950 (64 Stat. 1129; 5 U.S.C.1041) an order amend­
ing Rule 18 of the local rules of the court relating to the review (~
and enforcement of orders of administrative agencies. The Con- .
ference approved the amendment to the rule as submitted.
   Judge Maris called to the attention of the Conference the pro­
visions of Public Law 85-791 with respect to the approval by the
Conference of uniform rules for the abbreviation of the record on
review or enforcement of orders of administrative agencies. The
Conference referred the matter to the Standing Committee of the
Conference on Rules of Practice and Procedure for consideration
and report to the Conference.
      CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER SUBMISSION
  The Administrative Office submitted to the Conference a report
on cases and motions under advisement in the district courts. The
report listed 13 oases and motions which had been under advise­
ment by the district courts more than 6 months on September 1,
1958. Where necessary, these will be brought to the attention of
the circuit council by the chief judge of the cirouit.

                                                                     (

   The Conference renewed the authorization to the Chief Justice
to take whatever action he may consider desirable with respect to
increasing the membership of existing committees, the filling of
committee vacancies and the appointment of new committees.
Subject to such action all existing committees, including the Ad­
visory Committee to assist the Director in the performance of his
duties, were continued.
   Pursuant to the authorization of the Conference the Chief Jus­
tice appointed the following Committee:
   Habeas Corpus: Circuit Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman; Cir­
cuit Judges Albert Lee Stephens and Simon E. Sobeloff and Dis­
trict Judges Phillip Forman and Luther M. Swygert.
   The Conference declared a recess subject to the call of the Chief
Justice.

                        OF 

      THE HONORABLE WILLIAM P. ROGERS 

   ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 

                       TO 

THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES 


                Washington, D.C. 

                September 17, 1958 

                           APPENDIX

   Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference:
   It is a privilege on behalf of the Department of Justice to make
this annual report to the United States Judicial Conference on
past and prospective progress toward the more efficient adminis­
tration of federal justice.
   At the outset, let me say that in my opinion recent progress­
both in legislation and in operation-has been moderately good.
Many of the goals set by this Judicial Conference have been
achieved and there is promise of further substantial improvement
in making our system of justice more effectively perform the tre­
mendous tasks entrusted to it by the people of our country.
Legislation
   Turning to the legislation enacted in the last Congress, a num­
ber of bills recommended by this Conference have become law.
The second session of the 85th Congress enacted several important
measures which the Conference recommended and which the De­
partment was pleased to support. Among these is the bill in­
creasing from $3,000 to $10,000 the amount required to give civil
jurisdiction to the Federal District Courts, providing, for pur­
poses of diversity jurisdiction, that a corporation is a creature
of the state in which it has its principal place of business, as well
as of the state of its incorporation, and prohibiting the removal
of workmen's compensation cases from state courts. Also enacted
was the proposal for study by this Conference and recommenda­
tion to the United States Supreme Court concerning the rules
of practice and procedure in the Federal courts on a continuing
basis. Thus the Conference will replace the advisory committee
which assisted the Supreme Court in performing its rule making
function in the past, but which is no longer in existence. In addi­
tion with minor modification, Congress enacted the recommenda­
tion of the Judicial Conference for the relinquishment of admin­
istrative duties by chief judges after reaching the age of 70. Brief
                                (47)

 mentiQn shQuld also be made .of the legislatiQn sPQnsored jQintly
  by the Departments .of State and Justice looking tQward a mQdest ~~
  improvement in international practice and prQcedure by the estab·(
 lishment .of a tempQrary cQmmissiQn to study existing practices
 .of judicial assistance and cooperatiQn between the United States
 and foreign cQuntries.
    One other measure enacted by the last Congress merits particu­
 lar comment. I refer tQ the three-pronged legislation aimed at
 reducing undesirable disparity in sentencing which, with the
 backing of the Advisory Corrections CQuncil and this Conference,
 has nQW becQme law. Two .of the three principal features of this
 legislatiQn were strongly sUPPQrted by the Department-the pro­
 vision authorizing the Judicial Conference to establish institutes
 and jQint councils .on sentencing and the provision permitting
 greater flexibility in fixing the time the offender actually serves.
 The third, which extends sentencing provisions of the Youth Cor­
 rectiQns Act to defendants between 21 and 26 years .of age, the
 Department .opposed. We were of the opinion that a misnomer
 which classifies such a group comprising some of our most hard­
 ened criminals as "youthful offenders" might reflect adversely on
 the whole program.
    We are hopeful that the use of the first two mentioned prQvi(
 sions of the new law will substantially alleviate the inequalities
 in the length of terms imposed for similar offenses and the unfor­
 tunate consequences such disparities have .on rehabilitation, as
 well as deterrence. It is to be hoped, for example, that the wide
 divergences in sentences imposed in income tax evasion cases can
 be greatly narrowed in the future. One example .of the areas
 which require study involves sentences in tax cases. Over a
 twelve-year period (1946-58), 85 out .of 94 defendants convicted
 in the Western District of Washington went tQ jail while at the
 same time in the District .of Nebraska .out of the same number .of
 defendants convicted only 6 were imprisoned. In the Southern
 District of CalifQrnia, only 27 percent of all those convicted were
'imprisQned while in the N Qrthern District of the same state,
 57 percent went to jail. The discrepancy in treatment between
 the Northern and Southern Districts .of Ohio has been even more
 prQnQunced, 70 percent gQing to prison in the Northern District
 and .only 33 percent in the Southern District. Similar statistics

                                                                  (
                                  49 

 can no doubt be assembled in respect of other kinds of federal
 crnnes.
. Turning to the legislation which Congress failed to enact, the
 most important possibly was the omnibus judgeship bill. As you
 know, the bill, H.R. 13672, including all of the recommendations of
 the Judicial Conference (plus an additional temporary court of
 appeals judgeship for the Eighth Circuit) was reported favorably
 to the House and ordered favorably reported to the Senate by their
 respective Judiciary Committees without dissenting vote.
    That the omnibus judgeship bill failed of passage in the closing
 sessions is not attributable to any lack of public support or effort
 on the part of those who favored it. Indeed, strong nonpartisan
 expressions of support for the program and recognition of the
 urgent need for the additional judges it would provide came from
 all segments of the country as demonstrated by hundreds of letters,
 newspaper editorials and radio and television commentaries. Con­
 sidering that the problem is not of a kind as likely to arouse public
 awareness as, for example, dramatic issues in the foreign policy or
 educational field, the public response seems to me all the more re­
 markable. I sincerely hope and assume that the new Congress will
 act promptly next year to create the additional judgeships for
.which the need has been so amply demonstrated.
    Next year would also be an appropriate time to move forward
 toward another improvement in our system of Federal justice­
 the provision of adequately compensated and experienced counsel
 for indigent defendants accused of crime. You will recall that
 this Conference renewed its earlier recommendation for public de­
 fender legislation in March of 1957. It is very encouraging to note
 that a bill in the form approved by the Conference passed the
 Senate this year. The Department is planning in the months
 ahead to make a sustained drive in cooperation with the Con­
 ference to secure the enactment of legislation along this line. In
 considering the need for such a program at this time, it is worth
 suggesting that by providing better representation for indigent
 defendants we may measurably reduce the burden on our courts,
 not only on trial and appeal, but in the habeas corpus proceedings
 that sometimes follow.
    To conclude the legislative part of this report let me refer to the
 defeat of two bills the Department strongly opposed. The first,
 S. 2646, commonly called the Jenner-Butler bill, before its amend­
                                 50 


ment provided for the withdrawal of appellate jurisdiction from
Supreme Court in five specified areas. As to this bill, we said,
"This type of legislation threatens the independence of the Ju- I.
diciary. . . . [I] ts enactment would be extremely detrimental to
the proper administration of justice and harmful to our balanced
system of government based on the separation of powers among
the three great branches of our government."
   The other bill, H.R. 3, was designed to revive certain state laws
previously held unconstitutional because of their conflict with fed­
eral statutes. Its key provision was a retroactive rule of inter­
pretation that no act of Congress may be construed to indicate the
intent to occupy a field to the exclusion of state laws, unless there
is an express provision to that effect or unless there is a direct and
positive conflict so that they cannot consistently stand together.
The Department opposed this bill on the ground it "is so broadly
drawn that its effect cannot be foretold and if it is effective. it
must change the meaning of statutes conclusively interpreted
many years ago, basic statutes under which millions of dollars
have been invested and under which important human relation­
ships have become fixed". Fortunately, these bills failed to pass.
Administrative matters                                                 (
   Against this background of legislative accomplishments, there
have been some significant improvements in administrative mat­
ters. Not that the overall congestion in our Federal courts when
measured against the number of cases pending and disposed of, of
average number of months of delay in reaching trial, is less than
last year. It has in fact increased. However, in particular areas
there has been gratifying progress toward increasing the efficiency
of handling the Government's litigation. It is useful to consider
what has been accomplished in some of these areas.
   During fiscal 1958, the Tax Division of the Department reduced
its backlog of pending work for the fourth straight year, despite
the receipt of the largest number of new oases in its history. The
cut in 1958 amounted to approximately 300 cases and matters,
bringing the total reduction for the four year period to more than
2,300. In the eight preceding years the backlog of pending tax
cases increased eaeh year, from 2,237 at the beginning of 1947 to
6,770 at the end of 1954. By reversing this trend in the face of an
ever increasing volume of new business, the Tax Division has made
a notable contribution to the relief of congestion in the courts.      (
                                       51 

         Fiscal 1958 also saw the Tax Division cut into and roll back by
      nearly 22 million dollars the growing dollar backlog involved in
      pending tax cases This was the first such reduction since 1950
      and, again, was accomplished in spite of a record dollar volume of
      new business. By doing so, the Division cut the potential interest
      liability of the Government by more than $3,000 per day with a
      consequent potential interest saving for the year of approximately
      1.2 million dollars.
         No single factor is responsible for bringing about these results,
      but several steps are worthy of mention:
         There were many complaints in the past as to the Government's
      delay in filing answers to petitions in tax cases. The complaints
      were justified, for in earlier years requests for delays in filing tax
      pleadings averaged more than two requests per case. By scruti­
      nizing closely every request proposed for such an extension of time,
      the number of such requests was cut to 151 in 1958, an average of
      only 0.09 per case-and this despite the fact that the caseload has
      been nearly doubled.
         In addition, the Tax Division has established a Litigation Con­
      trol Unit, charged with the full time duty of continuously review­
      ing the flow of tax litigation through the courts, of pinpointing and
(   . eliminating bottlenecks and other causes of delay, and of suggest­
      ing changes in procedure calculated to expedite the handling of
      litigation. This unit has contributed greatly to the general speedup
      program. To take one example, in the matter of accelerating de­
      livery of refund checks to taxpayers on judgments adverse to the
      Government, the average time for delivery of the checks has been
      cut from more than seven to less than three months, with a result­
      ant interest saving to the Government of approximately $1 million
      in 1958 alone.
         In conjunction with the Office of the Chief Counsel of Internal
      Revenue, a Tax Liaison Committee was created which meets
      monthly and works from a prepared agenda. This has resulted in
      a close working relationship at a high level between the Revenue
      Service and the Tax Division and many problems have been
      solved in these conferences in a manner which has contributed to
      prompt handling of litigation.
         The result of these and other steps taken with the close coopera­
      tion of the judges has been to reduce the time for the processing of
      tax cases through the District Courts from an average of 2 years
                                  52 

and 11 months in 1952 to 1 year and 7 months in 1958, a reduction
of time of more than one full year.
   The Civil Division of the Department, which, as you know,1
handles the bulk of the Government's civil litigation, too has been
making strenuous efforts to reduce the heavy volume of its civil
caseload. Over a six year period the number of cases pending in
that Division has been reduced from 72,000 civil cases and matters
to 15,000, a reduction of about 80 percent.
   These results have been achieved by the institution of more
expeditious and efficient procedures for the handling of cases, by
extensive delegations of authority for the handling of minor cases,
which involve substantial numbers, to the United States Attor­
neys in the field, and by constant emphasis upon the desirability of
the settlement of cases which do not involve any major legal prin­
ciple of significance to the Government. Thousands of civil cases
are now disposed of at an early stage or even prior to the institution
of suit without the Federal Courts being burdened with the hear­
ings incident to their disposition. For example, during fiscal 1958
the largest number of suits under the Tort Claims Act were settled
since the Act was adopted-647 as compared with 427 in 1957.
   The Civil Division has accorded particular priority to the dis- .
position of government cases involving the payment of interest bye
the Government from the time the claims arose which are known
as "just compensation cases". Examples are cases in which the
Government appropriated vessels during a war emergency and
is obligated to pay just compensation for fair value. During fiscal
1956, the Government paid $6,323,000 in interest on such claims.
During 1957, such interest payments had been reduced to $294,000
and during 1958 to $163,194.
   One of the means that shows promise of reducing court conges­
tion in this field is the use of a periodic special call of all civil gov­
ernment cases. Some District Courts in the West have special
calendars for government civil tax cases, but there may be advan­
tages in .a special calendar for all civil government cases.
   Last March a Judge in the Eastern District of New York, in an
effort to cut the backlog of cases pending on the congested civil
calendar in his district, made a mass calendar call. Many of the
cases which were answered "ready" were promptly set down for
settlement conferences in his chambers. In that district there
were approximately 700 cases on the civil calendar, about one­
                                                                       (
                                 53 

half of which were government cases. At the Judge's suggestion,
 a representative of the Civil Division attended many of the con­
 :erences involving the Tort Claims Act cases in order to have
 present Washington counsel, who would ordinarily make an inde­
pendent review of any large settlement recommendation by the
 United States Attorney. As a consequence, a substantial number
of government cases were settled without trial.
   In another area, a little known program is now being quietly
completed by the Civil Division in a way that is making a marked
 contribution to the administration of justice for an important
group of our people. When in 1942, the War Department ordered
the desperately hasty evacuation of over 110,000 persons of Jap­
anese ancestry, 65 percent of them native born citizens, the
evacuees suffered heavy financial losses through the abandonment,
sale at sacrifice prices or inadequate care of the businesses, homes
and personal possessions left behind them. In addition, the
treatment .accorded these loyal Nisei forced a number of them to
renounce their United States citizenship.
   Under the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil
Division, the Japanese Claims Section is now winding up the
approximately 26,000 claims filed under the Evacuation Claims
Act of 1948. As of the end of fiscal 1958, awards made on these
claims aggregated approximately 35lh million dollars, with dis­
missal of not more than 3 percent of the claims filed. Yet prior
to 1951 only 745 claims had been acted upon with awards totalling
only a fraction of the final sums. It is significant that one of the
principal reasons it has taken so long to make amends to this de­
serving group is that not until 1956 was the Department given
authority to settle claims in excess of $2,500 per claim and not
until 1951 were compromises permitted at all. lncidentallyonly
one claimant, whose claim involved an amount within the com­
promise authority of the Department, now limited to $100,000
per claim, has elected to exercise his right to sue in the Court of
Claims.
    On the question of restoration of citizenship to those who re­
nounced it under circumstances of coercion, technical legal objec­
 tions were at first invoked to defeat restoration, even though
the Department undertook to act on the basis of affidavits with­
out requiring resort to the courts in each case. In 1956, liberal­
ized standards were put into effect. 4,308 of the original 5,790
                              54 


renunciants have now applied for restoration of citizenship and,
except for 370 whose applications were denied and 367 whose(­
applications are all that remain pending, have once again become'
citizens of the United States.
   These are, of course, mere examples of progress in the admin­
istration of justice and, being drawn from the Department's ex­
perience, are naturally concerned primarily with its role in the
process. Certainly the full dimensions of the problem can only
be appreciated from the perspective of the courts themselves where
the Department of Justice is only one of the litigants. The recent
address of Chief Justice Warren on judicial administration, be­
fore the opening Assembly Session of the American Bar Associa­
tion meeting in Los Angeles, is one of the most significant con­
tributions that have been made in this field. It should be read
at least by every lawyer in the country and by every member of
Congress.
   The intensified efforts being made by the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Office of the United States Courts and his assistants
to improve the organization and administra,tive planning of the
business of the courts give promise of great .achievement. The
                                                               C.
Department of Justice stands ready in every way possible, in co-
operation with the Administrative Office, to support the recom- .
mendations of this Judicial Conference.
