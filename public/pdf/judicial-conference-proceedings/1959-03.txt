        ence. Joseph F. Spaniol, Jr., Attorney of the Administrative
        Office, served as reporter for the Conference.
          The Conference, noting the death of Judge William Denman,
        formerly Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, adopted the following
        resolution:
               The Conference notes with sorrow the death of Judge Wil­
            liam Denman who died at his home in San Francisco on
            March 9, 1959. For 24 years a Circuit Judge, for 9 years
            Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, he had become one of the
            best known members of the Federal Judiciary. He was a
            tireless worker; he was coura.geous in fighting for causes in
            which he believed, and he was aggressive in the defense of
            judges in his circuit when they were attacked. The record he
            made will not soon be forgotten. The Conference records its
            profound regret at his passing.
         The Conference also took note of the death of Chief Judge
        Bolitha J. Laws, and adopted the following resolution:
               This Conference has learned with profound sorrow of the
f--~        passing of Honorable Bolitha J. Laws, of Washington.
{              Judge Laws was born in the District of Columbia and, his
            father having died when he was a boy, earned his way through
            high school and through a law school education. He came to
            the federal bench from a successful career in private practice,
            and years of outstanding participation in civic affairs. He was
            for a time a District Judge and then became Chief Judge of
            the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
            by appointment by President Roosevelt. He was a dynamic
            leader of that court. He took vigorous part, both as a pro­
            ponent and a supporter, in many measures for the improve­
            ment of the administration of justice not only locally but
            nationally. To be mentioned especially in this regard are pre­
            trial and the participation of laymen in the problems of
            judicial organization. He took part in the work of committees
            of this Conference, and when the Conference was enlarged to
            include District Judges he became a member of the Con­
            ference.
               Judge Laws was an outstanding citizen, an outstanding
            judge and an outstanding participant in measures designed for

    the improvement of the administration of justice. The Con­
    ference notes his passing with deep regret and records its ap­
    preciation for his contribution to its program.                  :'
       A copy of this Resolution will be transmitted to the District
    Court in the District of Columbia and a copy to Mrs. Laws.
        REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
  The Attorney General of the United States presented an in­
formal report to the Conference concerning legislative proposals,
approved by the Conference and endorsed by the Department of
Justice, and other matters relating to the business of the courts of
the United States.
       HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
   Congressman Emanuel Celler informed the Conference that the
Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives had
before it several bills affecting the Judiciary which have been
received regularly in each session of Congress for the last few
years. He stated that the Committee desires additional informa­
tion and advice on these matters, and suggested to the Confer- ('
ence that it undertake several comprehensive studies.
                                                                     '-­
   Specifically, he recommended (1) a complete study of the system
of United States commissioners including the compensation of
commissioners and their jurisdiction to try petty offenses; (2) a
study of the organization and functions of the Judicial Councils
of the Cirouits, their jurisdiction over the internal affairs of the
courts of the Circuits, and the advisability of including district
judge representatives on the Circuit Councils; and (3) a survey
of the geographical organization of the entire federal judicial
system to be made in the light of population increases and eco­
nomic changes and to include a study of the adequacy of the
present number of places of holding court.
           EXPEDITION OF COURT BUSINESS
   The Conference received reports from the Chief Judge of the
Court of Claims and from the Chief Judges of the respective cir­
cuits concerning the state of the dockets and the need for addi­
tional judicial assistance in eachdistrict and circuit. These reports
were supplemented by the district judges who presented additional (
                                                                       .,
                                        5

       details concerning the business of the district courts in their
       Circuits.
          The Conference considered also the reports of its Committees
       on Court Administration and Judicial Statistics concerning the
       need for additional judgeships. These Committees were directed
       by the Conference at its last session to maintain a continuous
       appraisal of the effects of the Act of August 25, 1958 (Public Law
       85-554) which altered the jurisdiction of the district courts in
       divirsity of citizenship and certain federal question cases. The
       Committees reported that while there has been an overall decrease
       in .the civil cases filed in the district courts in the first half of
       the current year compared with the same period of the previous
       year, cases pending at the end of the period were more than a
       year ago. The declines which have occurred have not been uniform
       in all districts.
          After a full consideration of the Committee reports and of the
       views of its members, the Conference voted to recommend the
       creation of the following additional judgeships not heretofore
       recommended by the Conference:
               Two additional judgeships for the Southern District of New
             York
               One additional judgeship for the District of Maryland
               One additional judgeship for the Eastern District of Michi­
             gan, the first vacancy occurring thereafter not to be filled.
        The Conference also recommended the creation of one additional
      judgeship for the Eastern District of South Carolina in lieu of
      a roving judgeship for the State previously recommended; one
      additional judgeship for the Middle and Western Districts of Ten­
      nessee in lieu of it.s previous recommendat.ions for one temporary
      judgeship for the Middle District and one permanent judgeship
      for the Western District, with the proviso that the judge appointed
      to the position reside in the Western District; and two temporary
      judgeships for the Eastern District of New York in lieu of the two
      permanent judgeships previously recommended.
        The Conference did not renew its previous recommendations for
      the creation of one additional judgeship for the Western District of
      Louisiana, one additional judgeship for the Southern District of
      Texas, one additional judgeship for the Western District of Texas,
    " one additional judgeship for the Western District of Missouri, one

                                        6

additional judgeship for the Third Division of Alaska, and the
recommendation to make permanent the existing temporary judge­
ship in the District of Utah. The proposals to create an additional
                                                                                  ( )
judgeship for the Western District of Texas and to make perma­
nent the existing temporary judgeship in the District of Utah were
referred to the Committees on Court Administration and Judicial
Statistics for further study.
   All other recommendations for the creation of additional judge­
ships previously made by the Conference were renewed.
   A complete list of the present Judicial Conference recommenda­
tions for additional judgeships is as follows:

District of Georgia and the District of New Mexico be made
permanent.
  The Conference has also recommended that. the existing roving
judgeship in the State of Washington be made a judgeship for
the Western District of Washington only. (Conf. Rept., Sept.
1956, p. 6.)
              COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
   Chief Judge Charles E. Clark, Chairman of the Committee on
the Budget, presented an informal report to the Conference. He
stated that the appropriated funds for the operation of the courts
for the fiscal year 1959, together with the supplemental appro­
priation requests approved by the Conference in September 1958
(Conf. Rept., p. 31), appeared adequate and that the presenta­
tion of the 1960 budget estimates by the Committee and the Ad­
ministrative Office had been well received. He reported further
that the procedure for presenting budget estimates to the Bureau
of the Budget had been modified. Hereafter this presentation
will be made in tabular form and detailed narrative justifications
will be prepared only as required by the Appropriation Com­
mittees of the Congress.

   The Conference at its September 1958 sessiOon (Conf. Rept.,
p. 8) approved a draft Oof a bill to increase the maximum reim­
bursement for subsistence expenses allOowable tOo judges on travel
status from $15 to $25 per day, which has been introduced as H.R.
2909, 86th Congress. The Committee reported that in its opiniOon
the bill requires some changes and additions with respect to the
certification of expenses by the judge. The COommittee recom­
mends that payment be made in accOordance with regulations of
the Director and notwithstanding the Act Oof March 3, 1933. The
recommendatiOons of the COommittee are embodied in S. 1378, 86th
Congress. On recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
ence apprOoved this bill.
                         CLERKS' FEES

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Administrative Office had
submitted to the COommittees a repOort Oon a revision Oof the sched­
ule of rates for COoPy work and Oother miscellaneous services per­
formed by the clerks of court, which was prescribed by the Judicial
Conference in September 1945 (Conf. Rept., pp. 22-25) under
the authority Oof 28 U.S.C. 1913 and 1914(b).                        (~
   On the recOommendatiOon Oof the COommittees, the Conference
Increased from 40 cents to 65 cents per page the rate "fOor making a
copy (except a photographic reproduction) Oof any recOord or paper
and a certification thereOof" and revised the language in the sched­
ules now reading "for a photographic reproductiOon of any record or
paper and the cOomparison thereof, 25 cents for each page;" to
read "for a phOotographic reproduction and certificatiOon of any
record Oor paper, 50 cents per page;". The Conference directed
that these new rates fOor COoPy work be made effective both in the
courts Oof appeals and the district COourts Oon April I, 1959.
   The Conference directed that the dOocketing fee Oof $25 fixed by
the Conference under 28 U.S.C. 1913 (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1945,
p. 33) not be charged by the clerks Oof the COourts Oof appeals for
the docketing of an application for the allOowance of an inter­
locutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1292(b), unless the appeal is
allowed.
   Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
directed the Administrative Office to instruct the clerks Oof the
district courts, where necessary, tOo avoid the practice of taxing
                                  9

as costs in a criminal case the $15 filing fee provided for in a civil
case by 28 U.S.C. 1914.
   REEMPLOYMENT OF RETIRED EMPLOYEES OR ANNUITANTS

  The Committees reported that a number of former employees
or annuitants of the judicial establishment, who had attained the
age of 70 years or more, had been reemployed in their former, or
similar positions, and that a memorandum on this subject had
been submitted by the Administrative Office. The Conference
considered the matter fully and adopted the following resolution
with respect to retired employees or annuitants of the judicial
establishment:
       In view of the policy declared by the Congress in the Civil
    Service Retirement Act [70 Stat. 743 (1956),5 U.S.c. §§ 2251­
    2267] for the automatic separation from the service of em­
     ployees "who shall have attained the age of 70 years and
     completed 15 years of service", it is the sense of the Judicial
     Conference of the United States that the reemployment of
     any retired employee or "annuitant" of the Federal Judicial
     establishment, who shall have been or may hereafter be re­
    employed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 2263(a) shall, as a general
     policy, be limited to a period of not to exceed 1 year, and
     then only if it is clearly demonstrated that such reemploy­
     ment is justified.
       It shall be the duty of the Director of the Administrative
    Office hereafter. to bring this declaration of policy to the
    attention of the appointing authority at least 60 days prior
     to expiration of such I-year period of reemployment of an
    annuitant.
                    DEPUTY CLERKS OF COURT

   In accordance with the direction of the Judicial Conference at its
September 1958 session (Coni. Rept., p. 14), the Administrative
Office had submitted to the Committee on Supporting Personnel
a study of the qualification standards for courtroom deputy clerks
regarding the feasibility of including in these standards time spent
in institutions of higher learning as the equivalent of yearS of prac­
tical experience. The Administrative Office recommended to the
Committee that the qualification standards for senior courtroom
                                     10
deputy clerks, Grade GS-9 and Grade GS-7, be revised to read as
follows:                                                        /                    ')
Grade GS-9-In order to qualify as a courtroom deputy at a GS-9, at least 2
 years general experience in the office of a clerk of a United States court is
 necessary. Graduation from a law school of recognized standing may be
 substituted for 1 year of the 2 years of experience required.
Grade GS-7-In order to qualify as a courtroom deputy at a GS-7, at least 1
 year's general experience is required. Graduation from a law school of
 recognized standing may be substituted for the 1 year of general experience.
  Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the Conference
approved the foregoing changes in the qualification standards for
senior courtroom deputy clerks.

           CLOSING OF CLERKS' OFFICES ON SATURDAYS

  The Committee reported that several members of the Judicial
Conference had raised the question as to whether or not the offices
of the clerks of court should be closed on Saturdays. The Confer­
ence, on recommendation of the Committees, referred the matter
to the Committee to be appointed on Rules of Practice and
Procedure.
                    LAW CLERKS AND SECRETARIES

  Chief Judge Biggs reported that studies of the qualification
standards for law clerks and secretaries to judges had been sub­
mitted to the Committees by the Administrative Office, but that
the Committees had concluded that further study is necessary.
The Conference granted leave to the Committee on Supporting
Personnel to consider these matters further and to report thereon
at a future meeting of the Conference. (See Conf. Rept., Sept.
1958, pp.14-15.)

               PERSONNEL OF THE CoURT. OF CLAIMS

   The Conference at its September 1958 session (Conf. Rept., p.
10) referred to the Committee on Supporting Personnel the rec­
ommendation of the Court of Claims to reclassify one of the
positions of auditor from Grade GS-14 to GS-15. The Committee,
on the basis of the comparative study submitted by the Admin­
istrative Office, recommended that the auditor position referred
to remain at GS-14. Chief Judge Marvin Jones discussed the
matter at the Conference, and informed the members the auditors
in the Court of Claims performed a unique function and that there                i   )
                                     11 


    was no other exactly comparable position in the Government. The
    Conference thereupon approved the reclassification of the posi­
    tion of one of the auditors to Grade GS-15 as requested by the
    Court of Claims.
                          UNIFORMS FOR CRIERS

       The Committee reported a suggestion made by a member of the
    Conference that an appropriation be procured to equip court criers
    with uniforms. The Conference approved the recommendation of
    the Committees that funds for uniforms for criers not be included
    in the judicial budget.

                    NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS

       Chief Judge Biggs reported that several bills had been intro­
    duced in the 86th Congress to authorize the appointment of a
    commissioner for Grand Canyon National Park, and that the
    Committees were of the view that there is substantial need for a
    park commissioner in this park. The Conference thereupon ap­
    proved S. 1164, 86th Congress, to provide for the appointmeIit of
    a commissioner for Grand Canyon National Park.

                            COURT REPORTERS

       The Conference, on recommendation of the CommitteeE! ap­
    proved H.R. 4156, 86th Congress, which contains the proposal
    previously approved by the Conference at its September 1958 ses­
    sion (Conf. Rept., p. 11) to provide that the stenographic record
    of arraignments, pleas and sentences in criminal cases be made
    only when required by rule or order of court.
       The Conference approved the recommendation of the Commit­
    tees that the salaries of the court reporters in the District of Min­
    nesota be increased to $7,095 per annum, that the salaries of the
    court reporters for the Northern District of Georgia and the West­
    ern District of Texas remain at $6,505 per annum, and that the
    court reporters in the Districts of Arizona, Kansas, the Western
    District of Oklahoma and the Western District of Tennessee,
    remain in their present status in view of their pending advance­
    ment to salaries of $6,505 per annum. (See Conf. Rept., Sept.
    1958, p. 12.)
       The Conference authorized the establishment of the combina­
(   tion position of court reporter-secretary to Judge J. Smith Henley
         llQ9319--00-3
                                12 

of the Eastern District of Arkansas and fixed the salary at $7,095 

per annum, as recommended by the Administrative Office. 

                                                                       (
          MESSENGERS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that the recent reclassification of
 the messengers in the United States Court of Appeals and the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia from
Grade GS-1 to GS-2 resulted in only very nominal salary in­
creases for 13 of the 27 messengers. The actual increase was only
$10 from $3,815 to $3,825 per annum. The Conference, on rec­
ommendation of the Committees, directed that these 13 mes­
sengers in the District of Columbia by reason of their long service
be placed in the first longevity step of Grade GS-2 at an annual
salary of $3,920, and that similar action be taken as a matter of
policy for resolving comparable inequities which may arise in the
future.
                 OTHER LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

   The Committees reported that the following proposals have
been introduced in the 86th Congress:
   (a) H.R. 3217, to amend 28 U.S.C. 1332(c) to provide that a (
corporation for purposes of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction '
shall be deemed to be a citizen not only of the state of its incor­
poration but also of every state in which it is qualified to do
business.-The Conference directed the Committees on Court Ad­
ministration and the Revision of the Laws to make a study of
this bill and any bill of similar import which may be introduced
and to report thereon at the regular annual session of the Con­
ference in September 1959.
   (b) Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the Con­
ference disapproved the following bills to create new districts:
S. 871, to create a new district in North Dakota; H.R. 732, to
create a new district in Colorado; and H.R. 2811, to create a new
district in California.
   (c) H.R. 25fT, to increase the compensation paid to United
States Commissioners, except National Park commissioners.-This
bill is similar to S. 3841, 85th Congress, which the Conference
disapproved at its September 1958 session (Conf. Rept., p. 16) on
the basis that the fees of United States commissioners had been

     increased only recently. Upon the recommendation of the Com­
     mittees the Conference disapproved H.R. 2547 at this time.
        (d) /l.R. 163, to amend the Civil Service Retirement Act to
     provide jor the crediting oj service of United States commissioners
     on the basis of one two hundred and thirty-eighth of a year for
     each day's service instead of one three hundred and thirtieth of a
     year for each day's service.-The bill is similar to S. 3842, 85th
     Congress, which was disapproved by the Conference at its Sep­
     tember 1958 session (ConL Rept., p. 16). Upon the recommen­
     dation of the Committees, the Conference disapproved H.R. 163.
        (e) /l.R.3218, to amend 18 U.S.C. 3401, to a~~thorize a United
     States commissioner to try and sentence a person committing an
     offense punishable by imprisonment by not more than one year
     or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.-The bill retains the
     present provision entitling a person upon his request to be tried
     in a United States district court. The Committees were of the
     view that the proposal would effect a desirable enlargement of the
     present jurisdiction of the United States commissioners. Upon
     the recommendation of the Committees, the Conference approved
     the bill.
        (f) S. 419, to increase the maximum per diem allowance for
     employees of the Government travelling on official business.-The
     Conference, upon the recommendation of the Committees, ap­
     proved S. 419 insofar as it relates to employees of the judicial
     establishment.
        (g) S. 615, to amend the Civil Service Retirement Act to permit
     the retirement of employees with thirty years of service on full
     annuities without regard to age,to eliminate the requirement that
     the five years used in computing average salary jor annuity pur­
     poses be consecutive, and to provide for computation of annui­
     ties on the basis oj two pet'cent 0/ average salary.-This billliber­
     alizes the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act. The
     Committees recommended that the Conference approve S. 615
     insofar as it relates to employees of the judicial establishment.
     The Conference approved this recommendation.

Distriot of Alaska:
        Under the provisions of the Alaska Statehood Act the tenure of the
          referee will terminate when the District Court for the territory
         ceases to function. In order to insure that the services of a referee
         will be available to the United States District Court as soon as it
         assumes its functions, the Conference authorized the filling of the
         vacancy when it occurs upon the then existing basis.

                               LEGISLATION                                       ~


   Upon the recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee, the                      I
Conference reaffirmed its approval of the proposals contained in
the following bills introduced in the 86th Congress:
   (1) H.R. 78.-The primary purposes of this bill are (1) to pro­
vide the Bankruptcy Courts with clear statutory authority to de­
termine the effect of a discharge and (2) to provide that where
credit is extended upon a materially false statement in writing by a
bankrupt engaged in business, it shall be grounds for the complete
denial of a discha,rge, but where credit is so extended to a person
other than one in business, it shall not be grounds for the complete
denial of a discharge, but the particular debt so created shall not
be discharged. Separate bills to carry out the purposes expressed
in clauses 1 and 2 above have been introduced also in the 86th
Congress as H.R. 4150 and H.R. 4346.
   (2) H.R. 4158.-This bill relates to priority claims, statutory
liens and title to property. It preserves the present position of the
costs of administration and wages in the distribution of the assets
of a bankrupt and at the same time enables valid contractual liens
such as chattel mortgages, conditional sales contracts, trust re­
ceipts and the like to retain their position ahead of statutory liens
on personal property unaccompanied by possession.
 , (3) S. 808 and H.R. 2287.-These bills would amend Section
606(8) of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 1006(8)) to make more
debtors eligible to file Chapter XIII petitions by removing the
present $5,000 limitation on earnings. They would also amend
Section 659(3) of the Act (11 U.S.C. 1059(3)) which fixes the
commissions of the trustee in Chapter XIII cases at a fiat 5 percent
upon the amount of payments actually made by or for the debtor.
The bills would fix the trustee's commissions at not more than 5
percent.
                                  19 

   (4) H.R. 5747.-This bill would amend paragraph 6 of 18
U.S.C. 152 vilith respect to the concealment of assets in contempla­
tion of bankruptcy to read as follows:
        Whoever, either individually or as an agent or officer of any
     person or corporation, in contemplation of a bankruptcy pro­
     ceeding by or against him or any other person or corporation,
     or with intent to defeat the bankruptcy law, knowingly and
     fraudulently transfers or conceals any of his property or the
     property of such other person or corporation, or
   (5) H.R. 4850.-This bill would amend Section 60b-Preferred
Creditors; Section 67e-Liens and Fraudulent Transfers; and Sec­
tion 70e-Title to Property (11 U.S.C. 96(b),107(e), and 1l0(e))
to give the Bankruptcy Court summary jurisdiction in actions
hrough t under these Sections.
   The Committee presented drafts of the following bills prepared
by the Administrative Office to carry out various legislative pro­
posals previously approved by the Conference. On recommenda­
tion of the Committee, the Conference approved the drafts a,s
submitted and reaffirmed its approval of the proposals contained
therein.
   (1) H.R. 4887.-To amend Section 50 of the Bankruptcy Act
(11 U.S.C. 78) to authorize the Director to procure and maintain
a surety bond or bonds covering all referees in bankruptcy and the
members of their staff's under the procedure set forth in Title 6 of
the United States Code.
   (2) H.R. 4845.-To repeal Section 39a(9) of the Bankruptcy
Act (11 U.S.C. 67a(9» to permit referees to retain certain papers
until a case is closed, at which time they will be transmitted to
the clerk of the court for preservation as a part of the referee's
record of proceedings. This will relieve both the referee's office
and the clerk's office of considerable detail work.
   (3) H.R. 4840.-To amend Section 43b of the Bankruptcy Act
(11 U.S.C. 71b) and Section 34a of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.
62a) to simplify the filling of vacancies in the offices of referees in
bankruptcy. The bill would permit a vacancy in the office of a
referee to be filled when it is recommended by the Director, the
district judge or judges and the Circuit Council that the office
be continued on the existing basis, without following the proce­
dure of a recommendation to the Conference and without the
necessity of Conference approval.
   (4) H.R. 4341.-To amend Section 40d(I) of the Bankruptcy
Act (11 U.S.C. 63d(I)) to provide for the compulsory retirement
of referees in bankruptcy upon attaining the age of 75 years. The
bill would also provide that the amendment shall not be applicable
to referees appointed or reappointed prior to the effective date of
the amendment, thus permitting any referee appointed before the
effective date of the amendment to serve out his term of appoint­
ment.
   (5) H.R. 4693.-To permit the consolidation of the Referees'
Salary Fund and the Referees' Expense Fund and thereby sim­
plify and reduce the clerical and accounting work in the referees'
offices, the offices of the clerks of court, the Treasury Department
and the Administrative Office.
   (6) H.R. 4692.-To amend the Bankruptcy Act to provide (1)
that the filing of a voluntary petition in ordinary bankruptcy shall
operate as an adjudication; and (2) that unless the judge or judges
direct otherwise, the clerk of the court shall make the reference
in all ordinary bankruptcy cases (voluntary and involuntary),
Chapter XI (Arrangements) cases and Chapter XIII (Wage­
Earners' Plans) cases. The bill would accomplish this by amend­
ing Sections 1, 18, 22, 331, and 631 of the Bankruptcy Act (11
U.S.C. 1,41,45,731, and 1031).
PROPOSAL FOR AN OMNIBUS NONCONTROVERSIAL BANKRUPTCY BILL

   The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference a
proposal by the National Bankruptcy Conference for the prepara­
tion of an omnibus noncontroversial bill making clarifying changes
in various provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. The Conference, on
recommendation of the Committee, authorized the Administrative
Office to support such a bill.
IMPROVEMENTS IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION

  The Committee reported as follows on matters referred to it by
the C-onference at its September 1958 session (Conf. Rept., p. 28):
   (1) Elimination of the oath on proofs of claim.-The Commit­
tee presented to the Conference a draft of a bill eliminating the
requirement that proofs of claim be verified under oath and sub­
mitted revised claim forms prepared by the Administrative Office
                                 21 

containing the statement that any false material statement of fact
in the claim shall constitute a criminal offense. Upon the Com­
mittee's recommendation, the Conference approved the bill and
referred the revision of the forms to the Committee on Bank­
ruptcy Rules toO be appointed pursuant to Public Law 85-513.
   (2) Attorneys' fees.-The Committee reported that the Bank­
ruptcy Division of the Administrative Office had presented a draft
of an amendment to Section 60d of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.
96d) designed to give the Bankruptcy Court on its own motion, or
on petition of the bankrupt made prior to the granting of his dis­
charge, jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of fees paid
or .agreed to be paid to his attorney for services rendered or to be
rendered. As amended, Section 60d would read as follows:
       If a debtor shall, directly or indirectly, in contemplation .of
    the filing of a petition by or against him, pay money or trans­
    fer property to an attorney and counselor at law, solicitor in
    equity, or proctor in admiralty for services rendered or to be
    rendered, the transaction shall be reexamined by the court on
    petitiQn of the trustee or any creditor and shall be held valid
    only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined
    by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the trustee
    for the benefit of the estate.
       If, whether before or after filing, a debtor shall agree orally
    or in writing to pay money or transfer property after the fil­
    ing, the transaction shall be reexamined by the court on its
    own motion or on petition of the bankrupt made prior to dis­
    charge and shall be held valid only to the extent of a reason­
    able amount to be determined by the court, and any exceS8
    obligation shall be cancelled, or if exceS8 payment or transfer
    has been made, returned to the bankrupt. [The italicized
    words are new.]
  On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved
the proposal and referred to the Committee to be appointed .on
Bankruptcy Rules a proposed change in Schedule B-4 to cQnform
with this amendment.
  (3) Standing trustee8 for small case8.-The Committee re­
ported that it had considered the study made by the Bankruptcy
Division of the Administrative Office of the proposal to provide
a panel of standing trustees to handle small cases. Upon the
                                  22 

 recommendation of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed the
 following resolution adopted at the September 1954 session (Conf.
 Rept., p. 14):
         It is the sense of the Conference that a greater use of
      trustees in the administration of no-asset c.ases should be
      made by the referees in bankruptcy.
    The Conference referred to the Committee on Bankruptcy Rules
 the proposal t-o exempt trustees appointed in no-asset cases from
 the provisions of General Order 14, as was similarly done in Gen­
 eral Order 55(2) in the case of trustees appointed to handle Chap­
 ter :X~II cases.
    (4) Revision of the General Orders and Official Forms.-The
.Conference, at the request of the Committee, authorized the Chief
 of the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office to bring
 to the attention of the Committee on Bankruptcy Rules, to be
 appointed pursuant to Public Law 85-513, matters relating to the
 revision of the General Orders or Official Forms as may be deemed
necessary or advisable.

          CHANGES IN SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS OF THE
                         BANKRUPTCY ACT                                   (
     The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference the
 following proposals to amend the Bankruptcy Act:
   . (1) Trustees' fees.-The Committee recommended that the
 trustee's.closing fee now fixed at $5 by Section 48c of the Act (11
 U.S.C. 76c) payable after their services are rendered, be increased
~to $10, thereby making the total bankruptcy filing fee $50 instead
 of $45. The Conference approved the recommendation of the
Committee.
     (2), Changes in Chapter XllI.-(a) Section 678 of the Bank­
 ruptcy Act requires the clerk or the referee to transmit to the Secre­
 tary of the. Treasury copies of petitions, numerous notices and
orders in Chapter XIII cases as well as in Chapter X, XI and XII
proceedings. However, since Chapter XIII debtors rarely owe
substantial amounts in federal taxes, it seems unnecessary' to
require the .above papers to be mailed to the Treasury Department.
    The Committee recommended that Section 678 be repealed and
 that provision be made requiring notice of a first meeting of cred­
itors to be given in Chapter XIII ca.ses pursuant to Section 58e of
                                  23 

the Bankruptcy Act. This Section requires that notice of the first
meeting of creditors be given to the District Director of Internal
Revenue for the district in which the court is located and to the
Comptroller General of the United States. Notice of the first
meeting of creditors is also required by Section 58e to be mailed
to the head of any department, agency or instrumentality when­
ever the schedules of the bankrupt disclose a debt due to the
United States acting through any department, agency or instru­
mentality thereof.                                                 f

   (b) The Committee further recommended that all creditors in
Chapter XIII cases be required to file claims within six months
after the first date set for the first meeting of creditors in order to
participate in the debtors' plan. The Committee stated that there
is considerable doubt under the present law whether claims need
to be filed, although Section 656b of the Act provides that the
court, before confirming a plan, shall require proof from each
creditor filing a claim that such claim is free from usury. It, there­
fore, seemed advisable to the Committee that Chapter XIII be
amended to incorporate in it the provisions of Section 57n relating
to the filing of proofs of claim.
   The Conference approved both recommendations of the Com­
mittee with respect to Chapter XIII.
   (3) Time for filing claims in Chapter XI cases.-Creditors in
Chapter XI cases are not required to file claims, but those listed
in the debtor's schedule participate in the plan to the extent of
the amount scheduled, unless objection is filed. The Committee
was of the view that claims in Chapter XI proceedings should be
filed within 6 months after the first date set for the first meeting
of creditors and that notice of the first meeting of creditors should
set forth the last date for filing claims. The Committee therefore
recommended that Chapter XI be amended accordingly and the
Conference approved the proposal.
    (4) Time for review of referee's orders.-The Committee re­
ported that uncertainty as to the finality of a referee's decision
now exists because of the holdings of some courts that a referee
must accept belatedly filed petitions for review and certify them
to the judge who must determine whether he will hear the same on
the merits or dismiss them for being filed too late. The Confer­
ence thereupon approved-the recommendation of the Committee




                                                                           I
                                                                          .J
                                 24 

that Section 39c of the Bankruptcy Act be amended to read as
follows:
         A person aggrieved by an order of a referee may, within
      ten days after the entry thereof or within such extended time
      as the court upon petition filed within such 10 day period
      may for cause shown allow, file with the referee a petition
      for review of such order by a judge, and serve a copy of such
      petition upon the adverse parties who were represented at the
  • 	 hearing. Such petition shall set forth the order complained
      of and the alleged errors in respect thereto. [New language
      in italics.]
    (5) Verification of pleadings.-The Committee pointed out
that Section 18c of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 41c) requires
 all pleadings setting up matters of fact to be verified. On the
other hand the Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to bank­
ruptcy proceedings by General Order 37 insofar as they are not
inconsistent with the Act, do not require pleadings to be verified.
Because of the inconsistency, Section 18c applies. It was the view
of the Committee that the verification of pleadings was unneces-­
sary, and, therefore, recommended that Section 18c be repealed
and that the subsections following it be relettered accordingly.
The Conference approved the Committee's recommendation.
    (6) Terms of referees.-The Conference on the recommenda­
tion of the Committee approved a proposal to amend Section 34
of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 62) to increase the term of a
referee in bankruptcy from 6 to 12 years, provided there is incor­
porated in the bill, or enacted by separate legislation, an adequate
provision for the compulsory retirement of referees at an age not
greater than 75.
    (7) Salaries of referees.-The Conference concurred in the rec­
ommendation of the Committee that no increase be provided at
this time in the maximum salaries of full-time and part-time ref­
erees set forth in Section 40a of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.
68a).
    GENERAL STUDY OF SECTION        58 RELATING TO NOTICES
   In accordance with the Committee's recommendation, the Con­
ference directed the Administrative Office to make a general study
of Section 58 relating to notices and to report thereon at the next
meeting of the Bankruptcy Committee.
                                 25
              TRAINING COURSE FOR NEW REFEREES

   Judge Phillips reported that it has been the practice of the Chief
of the Bankruptcy Division, or a member of his staff, to visit new
referees as soon as possible after their appointment for the pur­
pose of familiarizing them with the facilities of the Bankruptcy
Division, as well as with other divisions of the Administrative
Office, and that it was the view of the Committee that much could
be gained through an administrative and procedural training
course for new referees which had been proposed to the Commit­
tee by the Administrative Office. On recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference thereupon authorized a 4-day confer­
ence of newly appointed referees to be held in Washington, D.C.,
subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

PROPOSAL TO SUBMIT SURVEY REPORTS BY CIRCUITS RATHER THAN
                       ON A NATIONAL BASIS

   Judge Phillips reported that the task of compiling, duplicating
and circulating the complete survey reports to all circuit and dis­
trict judges concerned places a tremendous peak load on the vari­
ous Divisions and Sections of the Administrative Office. To relieve
this situation the Administrative Office has suggested that instead
of sending at the same time the complete report to all judges, it
send to the circuit and district judges only the material relating
to their districts and circuits as it is completed. The work would
thus be leveled out. An identical transmittal letter and report on
the operations of the Bankruptcy System would be sent in each
case as is done at present.
   The Committee recommended approval of the proposal, and the
Conference agreed.
              SCHEDULE OF FEES FOR COpy WORK

  The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference the
schedule of special charges to be made by the referees, which was
promulgated on July 1, 1947, pursuant to Section 40c(3) of the
Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 68c(3)), for making copies (except
photographic reproductions) of records or papers and the com­
paring thereof. The schedule as originally adopted did not pro­
vide a charge for making photographic reproductions, but since
                                  26

that time a number of referees' offices have been supplied with
photocopying machines.
   In order to provide for such a charge for photographic repro­
ductions and to conform with the charges authorized to be made
by the clerks of court, the Committee recommended that para­
graph numbered 4 of the schedule of special charges for referees'
services be amended, effective April I, 1959, to read as follows:          I

        4. For making a copy (except a photographic reproduc­

     tion) of any record or paper, and certification thereof, 65 cents 

     per page of 250 words or fraction thereof; for comparing for 

     certification a copy (except a photographic reproduction) of 

     any transcript of record, entry, record or paper when such copy 

     is furnished by the person requesting its certification, 10 cents 

     for each page of 250 words or fraction thereof. 

        For a photographic reproduction of any record or paper, 

     and the certification thereof, 50 cents for each page; and for 

     comparing with the original thereof any photographic repro­

     duction of any record or paper not made by the referee, 5 

     cents for each page. 

  The Conference approved this recommendation.
             COSTS OF BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION

   The Committee reported that the Bankruptcy Division of the
Administrative Office had made complete studies of the costs of
Bankruptcy administration for the fiscal year 1957 in 19 districts
and had brought the results thereof to the attention of the ref­
erees by personal conferences in some districts and by mail in
others. Figures for the fiscal year 1958 show that the percentage
costs of administration of bankruptcy estates nationally declined
slightly from 25.9 percent in 1957 to 25.7 percent in 1958. The
average size of the estates administered in 1957 was $6,725, while
in 1958 it was $6,054. Normally, the percentage cost of admin­
istration will rise as the size of the estate decreases and vice versa,
so that the decline of 0.2 of 1 percent in 1958 was really greater
than the figures indicate.
   The Committee reported that in its opinion the cost studies
have been effective and recommended that they be continued.
The Conference approved this recommendation.

    thorized the immediate release of the action of the Conference
    with respect to the recommendations contained in the Committee's
    report.
                COMMITTEE ON HABEAS CORPUS
       Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on Habeas
    Corpus, reported that the Committee had reviewed the proposal
    previously recommended by the Judicial Conference embodied in
    H.R. 3216, H.R. 4958 and similar bills, 86th Congress, with ref­
    erence to habeas corpus applications to the United States courts
    by persons in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.
    This proposal was originally approved by the Conference at its
    March 1955 session (Conf.Rept.,p.18).
       The Committee reported that considerable opposition had de­
    veloped recently to the restrictions contained in the bill on the use
    of the writ of habeas corpus and that several members of the
    Supreme Court of the United States were apprehensive that the
    bill, if enacted, would unduly increase the work of that Court.
    The Supreme Court is not constituted to hear contested applica­
    tions for habeas corpus and if such legislation were enacted the
    Court would have to refer them to district judges sitting as special
    masters to hear the applications and report findings and conclu­
    sions to. the Supreme Court.
       The Committee presen ted to the Conference a draft of a bill
    which in the view of the Committee reasonably meets and should
    satisfy the objections raised by the States to the review by a
    single federal judge of a decision by the highest court of a State.
    The bill would limit the grounds for habeas corpus applications
    by state prisoners to federal constitutional questions; provide
    that a state prisoner may not relitigate in a lower federal court a
    federal constitutional question previously presented to the Su­
    preme Court and actually adjudicated adversely to him, unless he
    shows a material and controlling fact not on the record in the
    Supreme Court and which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence,
    could not have been brought upon the record in the Supreme
    Court; and provide for a hearing before a district court of three
    judges of all cases in which the writ is issued. The decision of
    the district court of three judges would be reviewable only on writ
    of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. It was
(
                                28 

the view of the Committee that only a very few applications will
present substantial grounds for relief and require the issuance of
the writ and the creation of the three-judge court.
   The Conference approved the proposal as a substitute for its
previous recommendation and directed the Committee, with the
assistance of Judge Albert B. Maris, to effect any desirable tech­
nical improvements in the bill prior to its transmittal to Congress.
   The Committee also reported that it had considered the pro­
posal to amend 28 U.S.C. 2241 (b) to eliminate the necessity for
formal hearing of the many habeas corpus applications trans­
ferred to the district courts, which can be determined under exist­
ing laws merely upon consideration of the averments of the
petition and the accompanying documents. Upon the recom­
mendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
following draft of a bill:
                                 A BILL
      To amend Section 2241 (b) of Title 28 of the United States
    Code in reference to the power of federal courts to grant
    writs of habeas corpus.
            Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa­
         tives of the United States of America in Congress             )
         assembled, That Section 2241 (b) of Title 28, United
         States Code, is amended by striking therefrom the words
         "hearing and" immediately preceding the word "determi­
         nation", so that Section 2241(b), Title 28, United States
         Code, shall read as amended as follows:
            "(b) The Supreme Court, any justice thereof, and any
         circuit judge may dedine to entertain an application for
         a writ of habeas corpus and may transfer the application
         for determination to the district court having jurisdiction
         to entertain it."
  The Conference directed that the Committee on Habeas Corpus
be continued for the further study of habeas corpus procedures
and related matters.
         COMMJTTEE ON JUDICIAL STATISTICS
                 , {



  Chief Judge Charles E. Clark, Chairman of the Committee on
Judicial Statistics, presented to the Conference the results of the
survey of the Committee of the effect on the judicial business of
                                 29 

the various district courts of the recent statute altering the juris­
diction of the district courts in diversity of citizenship and
certain federal question cases. The action of the Conference with
respect to the Committee's recommendations for the creation of
additional judgeships is set forth above.
  The Committee again recommended that as a means of fur­
nishing more accurate information on pre-trial conferences con­
ducted in the district courts the Administrative· Office be
authorized to request the clerks of the district courts in their
monthly reports to classify pre-trial conferences in accordance
with whether or not a pre-trial order was entered. (See Conf.
Rept., Sept. 1958, p. 34.) After a full discussion the Conference
approved the recommendation of the Committee.
    COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE LAWS
   Circuit Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman, submitted the report
of the Committee on Revision of the Laws.
   Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved the following bills which contain proposals previously
approved by the Judicial Conference:
   (1) S. 172 and H.R. 4085, to provide cost of living allowances
to judicial employees stationed outside the. continental United
States or in Alaska.-These bills are identical with S. 3374 and
n.R. 5801, 85th Congress, which were approved by the Judicial
Conference in March 1957 (Con£. Rept., p. 24).
   (2) H.R. 157, to authorize distribution of the Congressional
Record to judges and court libraries requesting it.-This bill is
identical with H.R. 1164, 85th Congress, which was approved by
the Conference at its March 1957 session (Conf. Rept., 'po 26).
   (3) H.R. 2976, to extend the protection statutes to probation
officers.-This proposal was last approved by the Judicial Confer­
ence at its September 1957 session (Conf. Rept., p. 40).
   (4) H.R. 2979, to authorize district judges to employ law clerks
and secretaries in the same manner as they are employed by cir­
cuit judges.-This bill is identical with H.R. 3816, 85th Congress,
which was approved by the Conference at its September 1957 ses­
sion (Conf. Rept., pp. 17-18).
   (5) H.R. 290, to provide life tenure for district judges in Hawaii
and Puerto Rico.-The bill is identical with H.R. 3811, 85th Con­
gress, approved by the Conference at its March 1957 session (Conf.
                                  30 

Rept., p. 26). Since Hawaii is now a State, the Co.nference re­
newed its recommendation only with respect to Puerto Rico..
   (6) II.R. 2981, to authorize the assignment of retired territorial
ju,dges to active duty.-This bill is identical with H.R. 3371, 85th
Congress, which was approved by the Co.nference at its March
1957 session (Co.nf. Rept., p. 26).
   (7) II.R. 2982, to establish the official station of a retired judge
assigned to active duty.-This bill is identical with the bill ap­
proved by the Conference at its September 1958 session (Conf.
Rept., pp. 39--40).
   (8) II.R. 4151, to authorize the Judicial Conference to establish
minimum qualification standards for probation officers.-This bill
is identical with H.R. 3817, 85th Congress, which was approved
by the Conference at its September 1957 sessio.n (Conf. Rept.,
p. 42).
   (9) II.R. 4153, to permit recovery of costs in tax refund suits
against District Directors of Internal Revenue.-This bill is iden­
tical with S. 3875 and H.R. 12664 which were appro.ved by the
Conference at its September 1958 sessio.n (Conf. Rept., p. 39).
   The Co.mmittee repo.rt.ed as follows concerning pro.Po.sals pre­
vio.usly co.nsidered by the Conference:
   (1) S. 286 and II.R. 448, relating to venue in tort actions in         (
the district in which the act or omission complained of occurred.­
These bills Wo.uld add a subdivisio.n (e) to 28 U .S.C. 1391 to per­
mit a suit o.n a to.rt claim in the district in which the tortio.US act
took place as well as in the districts o.f the residence of the defend­
ant and the plaintiff. S. 286 would also add a subsectio.n (f)
which is intended to. broaden the venue statute so as to permit
suit against any person or corporation in any judicial district
which is the residence of a state official who, by operatio.n of state
law rather than by actual apPo.intment, becomes the agent of
that person or co.rporatio.n to receive service o.f pro.cess. This
latter pro.Posal was contained in S. 1000, 85th Co.ngress, which
the Co.nference disappro.ved at its September session (Conf. Rept.,
pp. 36-37). Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference appro.ved H.R. 448 and S. 286, 86th Congress, the
latter, ho.wever, with an amendment striking out proposed sub­
sectio.n (f) fro.m the bill.
   (2) S. 353 and II.R. 495, to permit the registration and enforce­
ment of support orders in certain state and federal courts.-These
                                     31 

    bills are similar to S. 183 and H.R. 285, 85th Congress. At its
(
    September 1957 session (Conf. Rept., p. 37), the Conference dis­
    approved the provisions of these bills which would provide for the
    registration and enforcement of support orders by federal district
    courts and expressed no opinion on the other features of the bills.
    Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference re­
    affirmed this action with respect to S. 353 and H.R. 495, 86th
    Congress.
       (3) H.R. 590, H.R. 2238, and H.R. 3091, to authorize members
    of the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States to practice
    before the courts of appeals and district courts except the district
    court for the District of Columbia.-These bills are similar to
    H.R. 815, 85th Congress, disapproved by the Conference at its
    March 1957 session (Conf. Rept., pp. 26-27). Upon the recom­
    mendation of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its dis­
    approval of the proposals contained in H.R. 590, H.R. 2238, and
    H.R. 3091, 86th Congress.
       (4) H.R. 5396, to authorize the transfer of cases between the
    district courts and the Court of Claims.-The Committee reported
    that the Secretary of Commerce had proposed several amendments

c   to H.R. 3046, 85th Congress, approved by the Conference in Sep­
    t.ember 1957 (Conf. Rept., p. 35). These proposed amendments
    would make the transfer of cases between the district courts and
    the Court of Claims discretionary with the court in the interests
    of justice rather than mandatory and would provide that in the
    case of a transfer from the Court of Claims to a district court the
    case should proceed as if it had been filed in the district court on
    the date it was filed in the Court of Claims, so that the application
    of any defense of laches or statute of limitations would not be
    affected by the. transfer. The Committee was of the view that
    these amendments are desirable, and upon its recommendation the
    Conference approved H.R. 5396, with these two amendments sug­
    gested by the Secretary of Commerce.
       (5) H.R. 5257, to permit noncitizens to proceed in forma
    pauperis.-The Committee reported that the Director of the Ad­
    ministrative Office had suggested that 28 U.S.C. 1915(a) be
    amended to make the in forma pauperis procedure available to all
    individuals, regardless of whether they are citizens of the United
    States. The Committee was of the view that the present stat­
    utory restriction of the in forma pauperis procedure to citizens is
(
                                 32
not justified and should be eliminated. Upon the recommendation
of the Committee, the Conference approved the proposal contained
in H.R. 5257.

           OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  Chief Judge Harry E. Watkins, Chairman of the Committee on
the Operation of the Jury System, submitted the report of the
Committee.
                           LEGISLATION

   Judge ·Watkins informed the Conference that several bills con­
taining proposals previously approved by the Conference had been
introduced in the 86th Congress. At the suggestion of Judge
Watkins the Conference reaffirmed its approval of the proposals
contained in the following bills:
   (1) H.R. 2978, to authorize additional peremptory challenges
to multiple plaintiffs in civil actions as well as to multiple
defendants;
   (2) H.R. 4157, to increase the compensation of jury commis­
sioners from $5 to $10 per day with no limit on the number of
days of service; and                                                        ')
   (3) H.R. 4343, to provide a jury commission for each United
States district court, to regulate its compensation, to prescribe its
duties and for other purposes.
   The Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of the proposal con­
tained in H.R. 591 and H.R. 1095, to provide that in a civil case
the number of jurors required to constitute the jury and the num­
ber who must agree for a valid verdict shltll be determined by
the law of the State in which the action is tried.
                   HANDBOOK FOR PETIT JURORS

   Chief Judge Watkins presented to the Conference a revised                      .l"
handbook for petit jutors serving in the United States district                   ,
courts. He informed the Conference that following the circula­
tion of the revised handbook to the members of the Judicial Con-                 ,.
ference in September 1958, additional suggestions had been made,
all of which have been incorporated in the revision. He stated
that it was the desire of the Committee to obviate any possible
challenge of the handbook in future cases and to secure its widest
possible use. He informed the Conference that the Committee
                                                                        \   J
                                           33
          knows of no case now pending in the courts challenging the use
          of the handbook.
             Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
          approved the handbook, as revised, and authorized the Adminis­
          trative Office to have it printed and distributed to those district
          courts which express a desire to use it.
                ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
            The Conference was informed that due to the illness or death
          of several of its members the Committee on the Administration
          of the Criminal Law had not met. Thereupon the Conference
          requested the Chief Justice to reconstitute the Committee on the
          Administration of the Criminal Law as soon as possible and di­
          rected the Committee to consider the views of the National Legal
          Aid Society on the proposal to authorize grants to legal aid societies
          and other organizations providing free legal services to indigent
          persons accused of crime in the federal courts, which was dis­
          approved by the Conferent:le at its March 1958 session (Conf.
          Rept., p. 33) and to report promptly to the Conference. (See
          Conf. Rept., Sept. 1958, p. 32.)
     c·     Judge Dimoek brought to the attention of the Conference the
          observation of Judge Irving Kaufman of the lack of any provision
          for the automatic setting aside of the conviction of a youth offender
          who successfully completes a term of probation under 18 U.S.C.
          5010, although the conviction of a committed youth offender may
          be set aside under 18 U.S.C. 5021. The matter was referred to
          the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law for
          study and report to the Conference.
             On motion of Judge Campbell, the Conference approved the
                        a
          convening of 2-day Institute on Sentencing in conjunction with
          the Seminar on Protracted Cases to be held at the University of
          Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, in July 1959.

'f        PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS OF AP­
            PEALS OF THE EIGHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS
            At the request of Chief Judge Gardner, the Conference, pur­
          suant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that terms of the Court of Ap­
          peals for the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be
          pretermitted during the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1959.

  At the request of Chief Judge Bratton, the Conference consented
that terms of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit at places
other than Denver be pretermitted during the fiscal year com­
mencing July 1,1959.

               MASTERS IN PATENT CASES                                        t
   At the request of Judge Paul Jones, the Conference referred to
                                                                              J
                                                                             \:'
the Committee to be appointed on Rules of Practice and Procedure
a proposal to liberalize the Rules of Civil Procedure with regard
to the reference of patent cases to masters.

     CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER ADVISEMENT

of 13 cases and motions which had been held under advisement
in the district courts for more than 6 months as of January 1, 1959,

the attention of the Circuit Council by the Chief Judge of the
circuit.
