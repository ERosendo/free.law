             REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
(
       The Attorney General of the United States, on invitation of the
    Chief Justice, presented a report to the Conference on matters
    relating to the business'of the courts of the United States. The
    report appears in the appendix.

    REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
        OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
       Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office of the
    United States Courts, had previously submitted to the members of
    the Conference his report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1960,
    in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 604(a) (3). The
    Conference approved the immediate release of the report for pub­
    lication and authorized the Director to revise and supplement the
    final printed edition to be issued later.
       State of the Dockets of the Federal Courts-Courts of Ap­
    peals.-The Courts of Appeals received a record number of new
    cases during the fiscal year 1960. Cases filed were 3,899, an in­
    crease of 4 percent over the 3,754 filed in 1959; cases terminated
(   were 3,713; and the pending caseload increased to a record 2,220
    cases on June 30, 1960. Reflecting the increased business in the
    Courts of Appeals, the median time interval from filing of the
    complete record to final disposition for cases terminated after hear­
    ing or submission in 1960 increased slightly to 6.8 months compared
    with 6.7 months in 1959. The Courts of Appeals in the Second,
    Fourth, and Fifth Circuits, where additional judgeships have been
    recommended, continue to be very much overburdened with case­
     loads far exceeding the average.
       District Courts.-The business of the United States District
    Courts, excluding Alaska, increased moderately during 1960, fol­
    lowing the decrease that occurred in 1959 as a result of the Act of
    July 25,1958, curtailing jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship and
    certain Federal question cases. Total civil filings were 57,665, an
    increase of 4 percent over the 55,521 civil cases commenced in
     1959; cases disposed of were 57,449; and the number of pending
     civil actions increased slightly to 61,016. Alaska is not included
     in these figures due to an adjustment made during the year as the
     result of admission to statehood.

    The median time interval from filing to disposition of civil cases
                                                                         \,
terminated by trial in the district courts in 1960 increased to 17.8
months compared with 15.3 months last year and the interval from
filing to trial also increased to 15.4 months compared with 13.3
months in 1959. The time intervals, however, are longer in the
districts with large metropolitan centers and sizable backlogs of
civil cases, and shorter in the other districts. Excluding the dis­
tricts with five or more judgeships, the median time interval from
.filing to disposition of civil cases terminated by trial in 1960 was
14.3 months and for personal injury cases it was 11.7 months.
    The 28,137 criminal cases filed during 1960 were about the same
as the previous year, terminations were 28,193 or 56 more than
the number filed, and the pending criminal caseload decreased
slightly to 7,691 cases as of June 30, 1960.
    For the fourth consecutive year bankruptcy cases filed reached
an all-time peak. Total filings in 1960 were 110,034, 89 percent
of which were commenced by wage-earning employees and other
nonbusiness debtors. A record 99,317 bankruptcy cases were
closed during the year, or approximately 2,500 more cases than
were closed last year. However, the backlog of pending cases con­
tinued to climb as filings outstripped terminations by almost
 11,000 cases. On June 30, 1960, the backlog of pending bank­
ruptcy cases had reached an all-time high of 94,990.

            EXPEDITION OF COURT BUSINESS
   The Conference received reports from the Chief Judge of the
Court of Claims and from the Chief Judges of the respective cir~
cuits concerning the state of the dockets and the need for addi~
tional judicial assistance in each circuit and district. These re­
ports were supplemented by the district judges who presented
additional details concerning the business of the district courts
in their circuits. The Conference also considered the reports of
its Committees on Judicial Statistics and Court Administration
concerning the need for additional judgeships, which were based
upon the studies made by the Committees of the judicial statistics
and other relevant factors.
   Mter a full consideration of the Committee reports and of the
views of its members, the Conference voted to recommend the
creation of the following additional judgeships not heretofore rec­
ommended by the Conference:
                                              5

             One additional judgeship for the Court of Appeals for the
          Tenth Circuit.
             One additional judgeship for the Northern District of
          Alabama.
             One additional judgeship for the Northern District of
          Georgia.
             One additional judgeship for the District of Alaska.
             One additional judgeship for the District of Arizona.
        Upon recommendation of the Committees the Conference dis­
     approved the proposal to make permanent at this time the existing
     temporary judgeship in the District of Utah.
        The Conference granted leave to the Committees on Judicial
     Statistics and Court Administration to consider further the need
     for additional judgeships for the Eastern and Western Districts of
     Arkansas, the Southern District of California, the Western District
     of Missouri, and the Northern District of Texas, and at the request
     of Chief Judge John S. Hastings, referred to the Committees on
     Judicial Statistics and Court Administration the proposal to pro­
     vide an additional judgeship each in the Northern and Southern
     Districts of Indiana.
('      On motion of Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, the Conference
     authorized the immediate release of its action with respect to the
     creation of additional judgeships.
        A complete list of the present Judicial Conference recommenda­

                       :sERVICE OF SENIOR JUDGES
(
        The Conference, noting the outstanding work of the senior
     judges who continue to serve the courts though nominally retired
     from active duty, adopted the following resolution:
        Whereas the reports of the chief judges of the several circuits made to the
     Judicial Oonference concerning the conduct of judicial business within their
     circuits have made evident the large and important contribution to the admin­
     istration of justice during the past year by the voluntary service of senior
     judges; and
        Whereas senior judges in many instances, although retired from regular
     active service, have continued to serve on their own courts even to the extent
     of contributing time and service to be expected only of regular active judges,
     and in numerous other instances have volunteered for judicial service in dis­
     tricts and circuits, other than their own, where the need was great;
        Be it resolved, That we now put on record our appreciation to each and all
     of the senior judges so serving for their great assistance to the courts where
     they have served and to the administration of justice generally, and we record
     our gratitude for their assistance and direct that a copy of this resolution be
     sent on behalf of the Judicial Oonference of the United States to each senior
     judge.

        REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
        Chief Judge William J. Campbell, Chairman of the Committee
(	   on the Budget, submitted to the Conference the estimates of ap­
     propriations for the fiscal year 1962, which had been prepared by
     the Director of the Administrative Office pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
     605. These estimates had been examined and approved by the
     Committee. The estimates total $52,713,100, an increase aggre­
     gating $3,523,200 over the adjusted appropriation for the fiscal
     year 1961. On recommendation of the Committee the budget es­
     timates presented were approved by the Conference, subject to
     amendments which may be required by other actions of the Con­
     ference at this session.
        Estimates of supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year
     1961 include $2,006,460 for the cost of higher salaries to court
     officers and employees under the Federal Employees Salary In­
     crease Act of 1960, including provision for increases in the salaries
     of court reporters and National Park commissioners; $140,000
     for the replacement of furniture in GSA buildings; $171,160 for
     furniture and furnishings incident to the occupancy of new build­
     ings in court quarters under construction; $144,240 for the pur­
     chase of West's Modern Federal Practice Digest; and $127,000
     for additional clerks to referees in bankruptcy for the last three
                                 8

months of the fiscal year. Upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee, the Conference authorized the Director of the Administra­
tive Office of the United States Courts to submit to Congress
estimates of supplemental appropriations necessary for these pur­
poses and for any other reason which at the time of the submis­
sion of these estimates could not be anticipated.
   The Director was further authorized to request a change in the
language of the appropriation for fees of jurors and commissioners
to permit the payment of compensation to voting referees ap­
pointed under the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1960.
   The Conference approved the inclusion in the budget estimates
for the fiscal year 1962 of the sum of $100,000 for pretrial ex­
aminers and staff for the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York on a one-year experimental basis.

JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORT­
  ING PERSONNEL AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT
  ADMINISTRATION
   Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
Supporting Personnel and of the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration, submitted to the Conference the joint report of the two
Committees.
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

   Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the Commit­
tees had considered the recommendations made by the Committee
on Judicial Statistics for the creation of additional judgeships and
all other pertinent data relating to new judgeships sought to be
created and that the Committee on Court Administration con­
curred fully in these recommendations. The action of the Con­
ference with respect to the creation of additional judgeships is
shown above.

        RETIREMENT PROVISIONS FOR JUSTICES AND JUDGES

  At the request of Circuit Judge John A. Danaher the Com­
mittee on Court Administration considered the proposal embodied
in S. 3721, 86th Congress, to permit the retirement of justices and
judges at reduced pay at age 65 after 10, but leES than 15 years'
service. The Committees were of the view that this proposal,
and similar proposals presented to the Committee, required fur­
                                      9

     ther study, and the Conference thereupon granted leave to the
(    Committees to report at a future session of the Conference.

                 STATUS OF CERTAIN SECRETARIES TO JUDGES

        Chief Judge Biggs reported that the Director of the Admin­
     istrative Office had requested the Judicial Conference to review
     the proposed reclassification of the secretary to Chief Judge David
     A. Pine of the District of Columbia from Grade GS-9 to Grade
     GS-lO and the reclassification made in January 1960 at the re­
     quest of Judge Matthew F. McGuire of his secretary from Grade
     GS-9 to Grade GS-lO. In accordance with the recommendation
     of a subcommittee appointed by the Chairman to study the mat­
     ter, the Committee on Supporting Personnel recommended that
     both secretaries be classified at Grade GS-9, but that the return
     to Grade GS-9 of Judge McGuire's secretary not have retroactive
     effect. This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
        The Chairman of the Committees also reported that a subcom­
     mittee of the Committee on Court Administration had been ap­
     pointed to consider the request of the Director of the Administra­
     tive Office that the Judicial Conference review the circumstances
(	   attendant upon the employment of Mr. William K. Bronstrnp, sec­
     retary to Judge James C. Connell of the Northern District of Ohio.
     After considering the report of the subcommittee and various corre­
     spondence concerning the matter, the Committee on Court Ad­
     ministration concluded that Mr. Bronstrup has been serving in
     the position of secretary to a judge in a grade for which he did not
     have the qualifications and further that Mr. Bronstrup lacks the
     qualificiations for any grade of secretary to a federal judge. The
     Committee, therefore, recommended that the Conference instruct
     the Director to remove him from the payroll forthwith. The Con­
     ference approved the recommendation of the Committee and di­
     rected that all correspondence concerning the employment of Mr.
     Bronstrup be included in the records of the Conference.
                                SECRETARIES

        The Conference at its March 1960 Session (Conf. Rept., p. 9)
     had authorized the Committee on Supporting Personnel to con­
     sider further the proposal to amend the qualification standards of
     secretaries to judges, Grade GS-lO, by reducing the requirement
                                       10 

of 10 years' service as secretary to a Federal judge to 5 years or
its equivalent. The Committees reported that this requirement
of 10 years' service tends to make Grade GS-1O comparable to a
longevity increase, even though it is designated as a grade and
not a within-grade increase in the salary schedule. A survey was
made of several departments and independent establishments in
the Federal service, and, based upon this survey, the Administra­
tive Office was of the opinion that Grade GS-1O secretarial posi­
tions for Federal judges, based on normal qualification require­
ments and without resorting to longevity considerations, are
justified.
   The Conference thereupon adopted the following standards for
secretary, Grade GS-1O, for Federal judges, proposed by the Ad­
ministrative Office and recommended by the Committees, and
directed that they be made effective as soon as appropriated funds
are available.
                       Senior Administrative Secretary
GS-10 ______________________________________________________________ $6995
   Experience: At least six y~ars of experience as a secretary, of which at least
five years must have been as a legal secretary involving duties which demon·
strate the ability to take rapid dictation and a thorough knowledge of legal
terminology. One of these five years must have been as secretary to a Federal
Judge at grade GS-9. Substitutions or equivalents will not be acceptable for
this requirement. There must also have been demonstrated the ability to per­
form or supervise the assembling of technical data and the ability to conduct
such correspondence as may be assigned by the Judge.
   Substitution: 1. Study suecessfully cOIDI}leted in an accredited academic
institution above high school level may be substituted for a maximum of three
years of experience on the basis of one year of study for nine months' experi­
ence. However, this SUbstitution may not be made for over two years of the
five-year requirement as a legal secretary.
   Substitution: 2. Study successfully completed in law in an accredited law
school may be substituted on the basis of one academic year of study for one
year of experience for a maximum of three years. This substitution may not
be made for over two years ()f the five years' requIrement as a legal secretary.

                                 LAW CLERKS

   The Conference discussed the recommendation of the Commit­
tees that additional classifications for career law clerks be author­
ized and directed that the matter be referred to the Committees
for further study.
                DEPUTY CLERKS OF COURTS OF APPEALS

  In accordance with the direction of the Conference at its March
1960 Session (Conf. Rept., p. 7), the Administrative Office con­
                                               11 

         ducted a study and furnished a report to the Committee on Sup­
    (	   porting Personnel with respect to the grade classifications of chief
         deputy clerks and other personl1el in the clerks' offices of the
         courts of appeals. The Administrative Office recommended that
         these offices, except in the District of Columbia, be categorized for
         personnel classification purposes into three groups-Ylarge," "me­
         dium" and usmall"-and submitted position descriptions and clas­
         sifications in accordance with the three categories, which were
         defined as follows:
                                          Large Office

           A clerk's office of a circuit which has 6 or more circuit judges authorized
         and in which there are filed an average of more than 400 eases a year and
         for which a staff of 7 or more employees is authorized to handle the work.

                                        Medium Office

           A derk's office of a circuit which has 5 or more circuit judges authorized
         and in which there are filed an average of less than 400 cases a year and for
         which a staff of 5 or more employees is authorized to handle the work.

                                          8maZZ Office

           A clerk's office of a circuit which has 4 or fewer circuit judges authorized
         and in which there are filed an average of less than 300 cases a year and for

c        which a staff of 5 or fewer employees is authorized to handle the work.

            The Committees recommended that the position descriptions,
         qualification standards and education and experience require­
         ments for the positions in clerks' offices of the courts of appeals,
         as set forth in the Administrative Office report, be adopted as
         guides in cla...qgifying and filling these positions; that substantial
         latitude be allowed in allocating the positions because of the vari­
         ance in duties and responsibilities assigned, even though titles
         are identical; and that upgradings resulting from this determina­
         tion be put into effect as soon as funds become available.
            The Conference approved the recommendation of the Com­
         mittee with the understanding that the grades specified are not
         to be made applicable to the office of the clerk of the Court of
         Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Judge Biggs in­
         formed the Conference that the Committee on Supporting Per­
         sonnel would consider further the inclusion of this office within
         the over-all grade structure established for the clerks' offices of the
         courts of appeals.

                  CYl'HER SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

   The Conference at its March 1960 Session (Con£. Rept., p. 10),
upon recommendation of the Committees, directed the Adminis­
trative Office to proceed as expeditiously as possible with a
survey and the preparation of a report with respect to the appro~
priate grading and classification of personnel in the clerks' of­
fices, the probation offices, and the referees' offices of the district
courts to the end that a proper and equitable classification be
made for the various positions in these offices. The Committees
reported that this comprehensive district court personnel survey
is under way, but that since the survey is a very large undertak­
ing, considerable time will be required for its completion.
   Chief Judge Biggs informed the Conference that the special
study of the grade classifications of deputy clerks in charge of
divisions of district courts not having geographical divisions,
referred to the Committees at the March 1960 session of the Con­
ference (Conf. Rept., p. 8), and the special study requested by
Chief Judge Sylvester J. Ryan of the classification of courtroom
deputy clerks in courts having the central calendar system com­
pared with the classification of courtroom deputies in courts
having the individual calendar system, would have to be made as (
part of the overall survey of positions in the clerks' offices. _ The
Committees accordingly requested and were granted leave to in­
clude these studies as part of the overall survey and to report
thereon at a future session of the Conference.

 OVERLAPPING APPOINTMENTS OF LAW CLERKS AND SECRETARIES'

  The Director of the Administrative Office had brought to the
attention of the Committees a number of requests by judges for
authority to appoint an employee prior to the separation date
of the person whose position is to be filled, usually for the pur­
pose of providing training for the new appointee and of maintain­
ing continuity in court operations. The Committees pointed out
that in preparing the budget and submitting appropriation re­
quests to Congress no request for funds is made for overlapping
appointments for this purpose; that the appropriation could not
absorb them on a general basis, and further that provision has
been expressly made by statute for the employment of persons to
                                      13 

     fill vacancies created by separation of employees prior to expira­
(	   tion of terminal leave, which seems to imply that, unless author­
     ized by law, dual occupancy of a single position is considered to
     be illegal.
         The regular annual Judiciary Appropriation Act, however,
     states that "compensation [may be] paid for temporary assist­
     ance needed because of an emergency," which leaves the problem
     of a definition of "emergency" unsolved. Upon recommendation
     of the Committees, the Conference thereupon resolved that, as
     a general policy, overlapping appointments for the purpose of
     training a new employee or for continuity of official operations
     only, however desirable, should not be construed as an "emer­
     gency" under the provisions of the regular annual Judiciary Appro­
     priation Act, to justify such appointments.

                                MESSENGERS

        Chief Judge Biggs reported that in accordance with the direc­
     tion of the Conference at its March 1960 session (Conf. Rept.,
     p. 9) the Administrative Office had made a study of all positions
     of messengers in the United States courts including the Court
('   of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Court of Claims. The
     report of the study, however, did not include any recommenda­
     tion by the Administrative Office. After consideration of the
     report and a full discussion, the Committees voted to recommend
     to the Conference that no reclassification of messengers be made
     at the present time. This recommendation was approved by the
     Conference.
                                 LIBRARIANS

        The Conference at its March 1960 Session (Conf. Rapt., p. 12)
     referred to theComrnittee on Supporting Personnel for study the
     present classifications for librarians and assistant librarians. The
     Committee also received several suggestions from the Chief Judges
     of the circuits. A report prepared for the Committee by the Ad~
     ministrative Office proposed classifications for librarians and li~
     brary positions commencing with Grade GS-3, library attendant,
     to chief librarian at Grade GS-11. Upon recommendation of the
     Committees, the Conference approved the revised classification
     standards and grades proposed by the Administrative Office and
     directed that they be made effective when funds are available.

                           ANNUITANTS

   The Conference at its March 1959 Session (Conf. Rept., p. 9)
adopted a resolution declaring it to be the sense of the Conference
that the reemployment of any retired employee or "annuitant" of
the Federal judicial establishment shall, as a general policy, be
limited to a period of not to exceed one year. In order that em­
ployees not be denied coverage under the group health insurance
plan (Public Law 86-382, approved September 28, 1959); the
Committees recommended that the resolution of the Conference
be changed to increase the maximum period of employment of
annuitants from one year to 18 months. This recommendation
was approved by the Conference.
                         COURT REPORTERS

   Chief Judge Biggs reported that some progress had been made
in respect to possible changes in the court reporting system, but
that the Committees were not yet prepared to make a formal re­
port. A somewhat different type of sound recording machine was
recently demonstrated to the Committees, which is designed to
record with clarity a multiplicity of voices, even when several (
people are speaking at the same time.
   At the request of the Director of the Administrative Office, a
survey has been made of the court reporting system in the Federal
courts by Charles Parker, Jr., Esq., and Norman R. Tharp, Esq.,
management analysts, whose services were obtained through the
courtesy of the Bureau of the Budget. The report of the survey,
however, is SOlely the product of these two men and is not an official
report of the Bureau of the Budget. Upon recommendation of
the Committees, the Confer~nce directed the Administrative Office
to circulate the report to the judges, referees in bankruptcy, clerks
of court and court reporters for the purpose of securing their
reaction in respect to the report and its recommendations. A
separate memorandum prepared by Chief Judge Sylvester J. Ryan
will, at his request, also be distributed with the report.
  The Federal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1960, Public
Law 86--568, amended 28 U.S.C. 753(e) by increasing the maxi­
mum salaries of court reporters from $7,095 to $7,630 per annum.
Salary increases, however, cannot be made effective without the
approval of the Judicial Conference. The Committees were of (
                                              15 


         the view that the official court reporters should be accoraed the
    (
   benefits of the Act and accordingly recommended that the sala­
         ries of metropolitan reporters be increased to $7,630 per annum and
         the salaries of nonmetropolitan reporters to $7,000 per annum.
         This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
            The Conference granted leave to the Committees to consider
         further the requested reclassification of court reporters in the
         Southern and Western Districts of Texas.

                            NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS

            The Committees suggested that pursuant to the Federal Em­
         ployees Salary Increase Act of 1960, Public Law 86-568, the sal­
         aries of the National Park commissioners be readjusted so that
         they may have the same benefits with regard to salary increases
         accorded by that Act to other judicial employees. Upon recom­
         mendation of the Committees, the Conference thereupon ap­
         proved such increased annual salaries for the National Park
         commissioners, as any may be fixed by the respective district
         courts, up to the following maximum amounts:

                     POWERS OF JUDICIAL COUNCILS

   The Committees submitted to the Conference a proposed
amendment to 28 U.S.C. 332 with respect to the definition of the
powers of the Judicial Councils of the Circuits. The Conference
discussed at length the need of such an amendment and directed
that the proposal be returned to the Committees for further study
in the ligh t of the discussions in the Conference.

                 ORGANIZATION OF JUDICIAL COUNCILS

   At the September 1959 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept.,
p. 31) Honorable Emanuel Celler, Chairman of the Committee on
the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, proposed that the
Conference undertake a comprehensive study of the organization
and functions of the Judicial Oouncils of the Circuits, their juris­
diction over the internal affairs of the courts of the circuits and the
advisability of including district judge representatives on the
councils. The Committee on Court Administration, on the basis
of its study, submitted to the Conference a proposal to reorganize
the Judicial Councils of the Circuits and to include thereon district
judge representatives.                                                  (
   The Conference, after a full discussion of the proposal, adopted
the following resolution and directed that it be circulated to the
Federal judiciary for their views:
  The Judicial Conference of the United States is mindful of the important
role of the circuit councils in supervising and directing the administration of
courts of the United States and emphasizes its belief that the greatest progress
in judicial administration can come from self-analysis and self-criticism by the
Judiciary itself.
  The Judicial Conference emphasizes to the judges of the United States Courts
the importance of using the circuit councila to promote the efficiency of the
courts and to execute the administrative policies laid down by law and by the
Judicial Conference for the operation of said courts.
  That the judges are invited· to submit their comments and suggestions for
improvements, wherever necessary, in the proper functioning of the said circuit
councils.
  Without limiting the generality of the inquiry and without intimating any
opiniOn, favorable or unfavorable, with regard to suggestioIis for reconstituting
the present judicial councils by reducing the number of circuit judges thereon
or adding district judges, the comment is solicited on the necessity and desir­
ability of such alteration in the structure of the circuit councilS.

                                      17
        On motion of Chief Judge Biggs, the Conference authorized
(    the inclusion in the budget of funds for the reclassification of
     judges' secretaries, deputy clerks of the courts of appeals and
     librarians, and funds for salary increases for court reporters and
     National Park c.ommissioners. The Conference also authorized
     the immediate release of its action with respect to salary increases,
     the overlapping appointments of law clerks and secretaries, the
     amendment to the resolution concerning the appointment of an­
     nuitants, and the salary classification of the secretaries to Judges
     Pine and McGuire of the District of Columbia.

                  BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
       Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on
     Bankruptey Administration, reported that the Committee had
     met and considered the reoommendations contained in the report
     of the Director of the Administrative Office, dated June 27, 1960,
     relating to the oontinuance of referee positions to beoome vacant
     prior to April 15, 1961, by expiration of term, for changes in sal­
     aries of referees, changes in arrangements, and the creation of new
     referee positions. The Committee also oonsidered the recommen­
(    dations of the district judges and the judicial councils of the cir­
     cuits concerned.
       The Conference had before it the Committee's report, as well
     as the reoommendations of the Director, the Circuit Councils and
     the District Judges. On the basis of these reports the Conference
     took the action shown in the fonowing table relating to changes
     in salaries and the creation of new referee positions and directed
     that, unless otherwise shown, this action become effective as soon
     as appropriated funds are available:

                                            19
      The Conference deferred action on the proposed increase in the
(   salary of the referee at Roanoke, Virginia, pending a further sur­
    vey of the entire district by the Administrative Office and a report
    thereon at the next meeting of the Bankruptcy Committee.
      Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference took
    the following action with regard to changes in arrangements for
    both new and existing referee positions and for the filling of va­
    cancies in referee positions. These are to become effective imme­
    diately, unless otherwise indicated:

                     SALARY AND RETIREMENT OF REFEREES

       In accordance with the action of the Conference at its March
    1960 Session (Conf. Rept., p. 15) the Committee reported that
    it had considered further the proposal to increase the maximum
    salaries for full-time and part-time referees. After careful study
    the Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
    approval of the proposals to provide a more liberal retirement
    plan for referees and to increase the term of a full-time referee
    from six to twelve years, and that the Conference approve the
    following proposals:
       (1) That the following language, or similar language to pro­
    vide for compensating retired referees for their services when re­
    called to duty be added to Section 40d(2) of the Bankruptcy
    Act:
    and the retired referee shall receive as full compensation for his services
    a . salary whi-ch shall be the difference between his annuity and the maximum
    annual salarY provided for a full-time referee under this Act.
                                22
   (2) That Section 40 of the Bankruptcy Act be amended to in­
crease the maximum salaries of full-time referees from $15,000
to $17,500 per annum and to increase the maximum salaries of
part-time referees from $7,500 to $8,500 per annum, with the
further provision that the salary of the Chief of the Bankruptcy
Division of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
be fixed at the maximum rate of compensation of a full-time
referee in bankruptcy.
   (3) That these provisions be made effective on the first day of 

the first month which begins more than 60 days after the date of 

the approval of the legislation. 

  The Conference approved these recommendations of the 

Committee. 

                           LEGISLATION

    Judge Phillips called to the attention of the Conference the
 following new laws affecting bankruptcy administration which
 have been enacted since the last meeting of the Committee:
    (1) Public Law 86-504 approved June 11, 1960.-This Act in­
 creased the closing fee of the trustee in bankruptcy from $5.00 to
$10.00 and thus increased the total filing fee in straight bank- (1
 ruptcy cases from $45.00 to $50.00 (Section 48c of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U.S.C. 76c). The Act also increased the filing fee in an
 original Chapter X proceeding from $100.00 to $120.00 (Section
 132 of the Bahkru ptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 532).
    (2) Public Law 86-519 approved June 12, 1960.-This Act elim­
inated the statutory requirement that proofs of claim in bank­
ruptcy proceedings be filed under oath. The words "under oath"
 were also stricken from the third paragraph of 18 U.S.C. 152.
    (3) Public Law 86-621 approved July 12, 1960.-This Act elim­
inated as a ground for the complete denial of a discharge the
obtaining of money or credit by false financial statements issued
by a nonbusiness bankrupt and made it clear that, although the
obtaining of money or property on credit through the issuance of
a false financial statement is no longer ground for the complete
denial of a discharge to a nonbusiness bankrupt, the particular
debt incurred as a result of such statement is to be nondischarge­
able under Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act.
    (4) Public Law 86-631 approved July 12, 1960.-ThisAct elim­
inated the requirement that copies of various petitions, notices,
                                     23 

     and orders in Chapter XIII proceedings be sent to the Secretary
i    of the Treasury (Section 678 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
      1078). The Act requires, also, that notices of the first meeting of
     creditors in cases involving bankrupts who are, or were, engaged
     in the business of transporting persons or property, be sent to the
     Comptroller General of the United States (Section 58e of the
     Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.c. 94e).
        (5) Public Law 86-662 approved July 14, 1960.-This Act
     amended Section 39c of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 67c) to
     make it clear that a petition for the review of a decision of the
     referee must be filed within the prescribed 1O-day period, or within
     such extended time as the court may allow upon petition for exten­
     sion filed within the 1O-day period.
        (6) Public Law 86-701 approved September 2, 1960.-This
     Act amended the sixth paragraph of Title 18 U.S.C., Sec. 152, to
     make individuals who knowingly and fraudulently transfer or
     conceal their property in contemplation of their own bankruptcy
    subject to the same prosecution as provided for agents and officers.
        The Committee reported to the Conference concerning the fol­
     lowing legislative proposals considered by the Committee:
        (1) H.R. 4150, 86th Congress, to amend Section 2a of the Bank­
     ruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 11 a) to give the Bankruptcy Court juris­
     diction to determin,e the dischargeability of provable debts.-At its
    March 1960 session (Conf. Rept., p. 15) the Conference recom­
    mended an amendment to this bill. As it passed the House of
    Representatives in September 1959, the bill granted jurisdiction
    to the bankruptcy court to determine dischargeability "upon appli­
    cation of the bankrupt and the creditor concerned." The Con­
    ference in March 1960 recommended that the word "and" be
    changed to "or" so as to provide that the bankruptcy court would
    have jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of provable
    debts either upon application of a bankrupt, or a creditor. Upon
    recommendation of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its
    approval of the bill as thus amended.
        (2) H.R. 4850, 86th Congress, to amend Sections 60b, 67e, and
    70e of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 96b, 10'le, and 110e) to
    give the bankruptcy court summary jurisdiction in actions involv­
    ing preferences, liens and fraudulent transfers, and the trustee's
    title to property.-Upon recommendation of the Committee the
                                 24
Conference reaffirmed its approval of the bill (Conf. Rept., March
1960, p. 16).
   (3) H.R. 7727, 86th Congress, to amend Sections 334, 367 and
369 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 734, 767 and 769) and to
add a new Section 355 to require claims to be filed in Chapter XI
 (Arrangement) proceedings filed under Section 322, within 6
months from the first date set for the first meeting of creditors as
is now required by Section 57 (n) in straight bankruptcy proceed­
ings.-Upon 'recommendation of the Committee the Conference
reaffirmed its approval of this bill (Conf. Rept., March 1960,
p.19).
   (4) H.R. 8708, 86th Congress, to amend Section 60d of the
Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 96d) to give the bankruptcy court
on its own motion, or on petition of the bankrupt made prior to
the granting of his discharge, jurisdiction to determine the reason.,.
ableness of fees paid, or agreed to be paid, to his attorney for
services rendered, or to be rendered.-Upon recommendation of
the Committee the Conference reaffirmed its approval of this bill
 (Conf. Rept., March 1960, p.19).
   (5) H.R. 9630, 86th Congress, to amend Section 11e of the
Bankruptcy Act (11 U.s.C. 2ge) to increase the period of time (
within which a receiver or trustee may institute proceedings on
behalf of an estate upon any claim from two to three years subse­
quent .to the date of adjudication.-A further suggestion was
made to the Committee that· the limitation period be left at 2
years with a proviso that the court may, for cause shown, extend
the time for bringing suit to 3 years. The Committee was of
the view that the proposal involves a question of policy to be
determined by the Congress, but sees no objection to the period
of limitation being extended to 3 years. However, the Committee
does see objection to giving the court of bankruptcy discretion
to extend the period of limitation. The Conference thereupon
approved the Committee's views.
    APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES AND AUDIT OF
                       STATISTICAL REPORTS

   Judge Phillips informed the Conference that during the past
six months members of the Bankruptcy Division of the Admin­
istrative Office had personally conferred with the referees in dis:"
tricts where there was evidence of a monopoly of appointments
                                     25 

    of receivers and trustees, or of the payment of exorbitant com­
    pensation. As a result, referees in almost every instance have
    taken steps to establish an informal panel of persons willing to
    serve as trustee by appointment of the referee in cases where no
    trustee is chosen by the creditors.
       The Committee has also been informed that the audit of statis­
    tical reports of closed bankruptcy cases conducted by the Bank­
    ruptcy Division of the Administrative Office was proceeding with
    favorable results. Recent reports have shown marked improve­
    ment in accuracy. Members of the staff of the Administrative
    Office have also made a number of comprehensive "operational"
    surveys of referees' offices in recent months and it is contemplated
    that these surveys will continue.

    REFERENCE OF CHAPTER X (CORPORATE REORGANIZATION) AND CHAP­
      TER XII (REAL ESTATE ARRANGEMENT) CASES BY THE CLERK OF
      THE COURT

      The Committee reported that it had considered a proposal to
    amend the Bankruptcy Act to provide for the reference of Chap­
    ter X (corporate reorganization) and Chapter XII (real estate
(   arrangement) cases to referees in bankruptcy in the same man­
    ner as Chapter XI (Arrangement) cases are now referred, but
    that the involved nature of the proposal will require numerous
    amendments to the Bankruptcy Act. Accordingly, the Chair­
    man has appointed a subcommittee composed of Senior Judge
    John B. Sanborn, Chairman, Circuit Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr.,
    and District Judge Edward Weinfeld to study the proposal and
    to report to the Committee at its next meeting. Mr. Edwin L.
    Covey, Chief of the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative
    Office, was named advisor to th~ subcommittee.

        ACCOUNTABILITY OF REFEREES, RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES

      Judge Phillips reported that the Committee had discussed the
    present policy with regard to the accountability of referees,
    receivers and trustees with respect to errors in the computation
    of receivers' and trustees' compensation and charges for the Ref­
    erees' Salary and Expense Fund. The matter has been deferred
    for further consideration at the. next meeting of the Committee.

ATTENDANCE OF REFEREES AT THE ANNUAL JUDICIAL CONFERENCES
                                OF THE CIRCUITS

   The Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit had recom­
mended that 28 U.S.C. 333, relating to the constitution of the
Judicial Conferences of the Circuits, be amended by including
therein the referees in bankruptcy. The Committee was in­
formed that the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit had extended
an invitation to all referees in the Circuit to attend the annual
Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit, which was held recently.
The Administrative Office at the request of the Committee esti­
mated that the cost of travel and subsistence of the 31 referees
in the Ninth Circuit for attendance at the Circuit Judicial Con­
ference would be $3,000 a year, and that if the practice were uni­
versally followed in all circuits, the total annual cost would be
approximately $25,000. This would require an increase in the
annual appropriations. Upon recommendation of the Committee
the Conference disapproved the proposal.
                        FEES AND SPECIAL CHARGES

  At the suggestion of Judge Phillips, the Conference amended
certain regulations adopted at the September 1947 session (Conf.
Rept., pp. 13, 14) to conform them to Public Law 86-110, which
consolidated the Referee's Salary and Expense Funds, and Public
Law 86-504, which increased the filing fee in straight bankruptcy
cases and in Chapter X proceedings. The revised regulations are
as follows:
1. 	FiUng Fees ana Charges in Reopened Bankruptcy Proceedinga
   There shall be deposited with the clerk, at the time a petition is filed to
reopen any closed bankruptcy proceeding (a) $32 for each estate for the refer­
ees' salary and expense fund; (b) $10 for each estate for the trustee's fee;
(0) $8 for each estate for the clerk's filing fee. Where applicable, all addi­
tional and special charges prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United
States pursuant to section 4Oc(2) and 40c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, as
amended, shall alBo be charged for the referees' salary and expense fund.
I!. Additional Charge8 To Be Made Upon the Tramfer of an Original Ohapter
    X Prooeeding to a Regular Bankruptcy Prooeeding
  Upon the transfer of an original Chapter X proceeding to a regular bank­
ruptcy proceeding, an additional charge shall be made in the sum of $15 to be
paid by the trustee out of the assets of the estate to the clerk of the court for
deposit .to the credit of the referees' salary and expense fund in the United
States Treasury. This charge shall apply only to Chapter X proceedings where
the original petition was filed prior to June 11, 1960.
    •           •           •           •          •           •           •
                                   27 


   The Conference, at the request of Judge Phillips, authorized
t.he immediate release of Conference action with respect to new
referee positions and salary changes and directed that they be made
effective on October 1, or as soon thereafter as funds are avail­
able. The Conference also authorized t.he immediate release of
its action with respect to legislation and the amendments to the
schedule of fees and special charges.
JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEES ON THE RE­
VISION OF THE LAWS AND COURT ADMINISTRATION
    Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Committee on
 the Revision of the Laws, submitted a report on legislative pro­
 posals considered jointly by the Committees on Court Adminis­
 tration and Revision of the Laws:
     (1) H.R. 11403, 86th Congress, to authorize the granting of
 continuances in district courts to members of State legislatures in
 accordance with State law.-This bill would provide that any
 party to an action or other proceeding before a district court, who
 is an officer or a member of a State legislature, or who has, prior
 to or during the session of a State legislature, retained to represent
him in such proceeding an attorney who is an officer or member of
such legislature, shall be entitled to a continuance to the same ex­
 tent and upon the same terms, by virtue of the convening of such
legislature, as he would be entitled to if such proceeding were be­
fore a court of record of such State.
    The Committees were informed that a number of States have
enacted such statutes and that in many instances they have been
subject to abuse. l,t was the view of the Committees that mem­
bers of the bar of the Federal courts, who are also members of
State legislatures, owe a duty to the courts to so arrange their
affairs as not to interfere with the orderly conduct of the business
of the courts and to decline to accept legal retainers if their public
duties will prevent timely attention to the client's business. Upon
recommendation of the Committees, the Conference disapproved
the bill.
    (2) H.R. 12622, 86th Cong1'ess, to amend 28 U.S.C. 85 with
reference to the jurisdiction of the district courts.-This bill is a
revision of H.R. 10089, 86th Congress, which was considered by
the Conference at its March 1960 session (Coni. Rept., p. 41).
The revised bill (a) confers upon the district courts original juris­
     580810-61-5
                                  28 

 diction of actions to compel officers or employees of the United
 States or agencies thereof to perform their duty, (b) provides
 that civil actions in which each defendant is an officer or employee
of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official
capacity or under color of legal authority or an agency of the
 United States, may be brought in any judicial district where a
plaintiff in the action resides or in which the cause of action arose
or in which any property in the action is situated, and (c) pro­
vides that the summons and complaint in such an action shall
be served as provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
except that the delivery of the summons and complaint to the
officer or agency as required by the rules may be made by certified
mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action
is brought.
   The bill follows the recommendations made by the Conference
at its March 1960 session and upon recommendation of the Com­
mittees the Conference approved the bill.
   (3) H.R.I0843, 86th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C.142 to make
it clear that this Section does not prohibit providing accommoda­
tions for holding district court in Federal buildings in which no
court accommodations exist.-The General Services Administra-             (
tion has taken the view that, while it is empowered to enlarge
court facilities in Federal buildings in which such facilities already
exist, 28 U.S.C. 142 prohibits remodeling a Federal building to
provide court quarters therein for the first time. The Cammit­
tees were of the view that the construction placed upon this Sec­
tion by the General Services Administration is doubtful, but
recommended that H.R. 10843 be approved so that, in any event,
there will he no statutory prohibition against remodeling an.exist­
ing Federal building to provide court facilities at a place where,
pursuant to Act of CongresS and in the light of the amount of the
judicial· business, it is necessary to hold sessions of the district
court. The Conference thereupon approved the bill.
   The Committees also reported that the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office has considered it his duty to approve and to forward
all requests from district courts for additional court facilities
directly to the General Services Administration without himself
considering the necessity for such facilities. It was the view of the
Committees that all such requests should have the consideration
of the judicial council of the appropriate circuit before they l,tre
                                      29 

     transmitted by the Director to the General Services Administra­
     tion. The Conference thereupon authorized the Director of the
     Administrative Office to refer all requests for additional court
     facilities to the judicial council of the appropriate circuit for its
     consideration and judgment as to the necessity for such addi­
     tional facilities, and to request the General Services Administra­
     tion to provide such facilities only if and after they have been
     approved as necessary by the judicial council of the circuit.
        (4) S. 3444, H.R. 11940, H.R. 11958, H.R. 11960, H.R. 11961
     and H.R. 11990, 86th Congress, to prohibit certain judicial acts
     affecting the internal affairs of labor organizations.-These bills
     would deprive the Federal courts of jurisdiction to issue or continue
     in effect any judicial order appointing a receiver, trustee, monitor,
     or fldministrator, whether so denominated or not, to manage or
     administer, or supervise the management or administration of, the
     affairs of any labor organization. However, it would not prevent
     the appointment of a receiver for the sole purpose of preserving the
     funds, property or assets of a labor organization pending the con­
     duct of an election of officers or vote upon the removal of officers.
        The Committees pointed out that it has been a traditional func­
(    tion of the courts, through appointed officers, to manage and ad­
     minister, or supervise the management or the administration of,
     the affairs of corporations and other organizations when such
     action is required in the interests of justice and under the estab­
     lished rules of law. These bills would withdraw that authority in
     the case of a single type of organization, namely, a labor organiza­
     tion. The Committees were of the opinion that such an exception
     to the authority of the courts should not be made with respect to
     one partiCUlar type of organization. On recommendation of the
     Committees, the Conference thereupon disapproved the bills.
        (5) H.R. 12110, 86th Congress, to provide judicial review of
     agency orders concerning biological products.-This bill would
     authorize judicial review in the courts of appeals of actions by the
     Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare refusing to issue, or
     suspending or revoking licenses, for the maintenance of establish­
     ments or for the propagation or manufacture and preparation of
     biological products. The Committees were of the opinion that the
     type of review to the courts of appeals provided by the bill was
     appropriate. The Conference thereupon approved the' type of
     review proposed by the bill.
\,
                                 30
   (6) H.R. 9062, 86th Congre8s, to amend 28 U.S.C. 2103, with
respect to appeals to the Supreme Court of the United State8.­
The Conference referred the bill to the Supreme Court for its
consideration.
   (7) H.R. 1061,.8, 86th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 504 to pro­
vide that a United States attorney holding over in office after the
date of expiration of his term shall in no event remain in office for
                                                                         i
more than six months after such expiration date and that if no suc­
cessor has been appointed within such period of six months, the          J
district court shall designate a United States attorney to serve until
a succeS80r has been appointe d.-It was the view of the Committees
that the problem of the holding over in office of a United States
                                                                         I
attorney after his term has expired is primarily one for the Attor­
ney General and is a matter which can and should be dealt with by
him administratively and without the need for additionallegisla­
tion. The Committees were further of the view that the responsi­
bility of the district courts to appoint United States attorneys
should not be increased and recommended that the bill be disap­
proved. This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
   (8) S. 35J,.8, 86th Congress, to amend the Norris-LaGuardia
Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Railway Labor Act
to withdraw from their scope those labor disputes which involve
the creation or discontinuance of positions by employers.-The
Committees were of the view that the passage of this bill would
not materially affect the caseload of the courts, but that the basic
policy involved is one for Congress to decide. Accordingly it
was recommended that the Committee on the Judiciary of the
United States Senate, which had requested the views of the Con­
ference on the bill, be so informed. This recommendation was
approved by the Conference.
   (9) H.R. 2807, 86th Congress, to establish a statutory form
of judicial review of administrative orders for the deportation of
aliens from the United States which, except as to aliens in cus­
tody, shall be exclusive.-This bill was considered by the Con­
ference at its September 1959 Session (Conf. Rept., p. 8) and
approved. The Association of Immigration and Nationality Law­
yere, however, has requested reconsideration of the bill, and a
representative of the Association appeared before the
Committees.
                                  31 

   While the Committees did not see any reason to withdraw the
prior recommendation of approval, they noted that the bill also
provides that orders of exclusion shall be reviewed solely by writs
of habeas corpus, which would seem to have the practical effect
of denying to nonresident aliens, being not in custody, any re­
view of their exclusion. Accordingly, the Committees recom­
mended that the Conference adhere to its approval of the bill so
far as it relates to deportation orders and that the Conference ex­
press no opinion with respect to the proposed limitation to habeas
corpus of the judicial review of exclusion orders. This recom­
mendation was approved by the Conference.
   (10) n.R. 12653, 88th Congress, to establish a Court of Vet­
erans' Appeals and to prescribe its jurisdiction and functions.­
This bill, which after extensive hearings was favorably reported
to the House of Representatives by the Committee on Veterans'
Affairs, would provide for the review of decisions of the Board
of Veterans' Appeals in the Veterans'Administration by a Court
of Veterans' Appeals to consist of five judges to be appointed by
the President for terms of ten years at annual salaries of
$25,500. The decisions of the court would be final and not sub­
ject to review by any other court. Provision is made for the ap­
pointment by the court of not more than 50 commissioners, who
would conduct hearings in the veterans' localities.
   The Conference at its March 1960 Session (Conf. Rept., p. 41)
and at previous sessions decided to take no position with respect
to the policy involved in according judicial review to veterans'
claims, but to recommend that if judicial review is to be granted,
it should be in the district court of the veteran's residence. Ac­
cording to testimony given at the hearings conducted by the Com­
mittee on Veterans' Affairs, however, the number of veterans'
appeals is likely to be 80 large as greatly to increase the conges­
tion in the.district courts, if those courts are given jurisdiction to
consider them. The Committees accordingly suggested that the
Conference withdraw its previous recommendation that judicial
review of veterans' claims, if accorded, be in the district courts, and
that instead the Conference approve the type of judicial review by
a Court of Veterans' Appeals and its commissioners which is pro­
posed by the bill.
   The Committees pointed out however that the bill would also
include the Court of Veterans' Appeals among the courts of the
                                32
United States as defined in 28 U.S.C. 451 and 610 and for which
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts under the {
supervision of the Judicial Conference, collects statistics, super­
vises administrative matters and provides for the compensation of        I
personnel and other expenses and needs of the courts. In the
opinion of the Committees, the proposed Court of Veterans' Ap­
peals is not a court of the type intended to be included in Section
451 and that a sweeping and indiscriminate application of the
provisions of Title 28 U.S.C. tD the court would be unwise. The
Committees were likewise of the view that since the Court of
Veterans' Appeals would be wholly independent and not subject
                                                                         I
to supervision on writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court, the
Director of the Administrative Office, who is appointed by the
Supreme Court and who functions under the supervision and direc­
tion of the Judicial Conference, should not be given responsibility
with respect to the administrative affairs of the court. The
Conference thereupon withdrew its suggestion that this type of
review, if accorded, be in the district courts and approved the type
of judicial review by a Court of Veterans' Appeals and its com­
missioners which is proposed by H.R. 12653, but recommended
against the inclusion of the Court of Veterans' Appeals in 28
U.S.C. 451 and 610.
                                                                     (
   (11) H.R.12958, 86th Congres8, to amend the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954 to provide that taxpayers may obtain review in the
United States district courts of alleged deficiencies in payment of
taxes without being required to pay the tax before filing suit.­
The bill would give the United States district courts jurisdiction,
concurrent with the Tax Court of the United States, of proceed­
ings for the determination of alleged deficiencies in the payment
of taxes and would open the way for the institution in the district
courts of a large volume of tax litigation which is now brought in
the Tax Court. The Committees believed that this litigation for
the redetermination of alleged deficiencies in tax before payment
is now being handled satisfactorily by the Tax Court and that the
transfer of any substantial part of it to the already overburdened
district courts would not be in the public interest, since it would
serve only to increase the congestion in those courts and the conse­
quent delay in the trial of cases therein. Upon recommendation
of the Committees, the Conference disapproved the hill.

                                                                     (

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRAC­

           TICE AND PROCEDURE
   Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing Com­
mittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, reported that the Com­
mittee had been organized and that Aubrey Gasque, an Assistant
Director of the Administrative Office, had been appointed secre­
taryto the Committee and its five advisory committees.
   All matters referred to the standing Committee by the Confer­
ence have been in turn referred to the appropriate advisory com­
mittees for study and report except the proposal to establish
uniform rules of evidence in the district courts and the proposal
to provide for standing masters under Rule 53, Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. The standing Committee has decided to post­
pone consideration of the proposal for uniform rules of evidence
until later, in view of the large program presently being under­
taken by the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. With respect
to the proposal for standing masters, the standing Committee
is of the opinion that Rule 53 in its present form gives full author­
ity to the district courts to appoint such officers and that all that
is now needed is a sufficient appropriation by the Congress of
funds for their compensation and expenses.
   At the suggestion of Judge Maris the courts of appeals were
requested to submit to the Committee on Rules of Practice and
Procedure, for consideration and report to the Judicial Confer­
ence, any rules or amendments thereto adopted by such courts
which are by statute required to have the approval of the Judicial
Conference.
   Judge Maris urged the appointment of local circuit Committees
on Rules of Practice and Procedure that would be accorded a place
on the programs of the Judicial Conferences of the Circuits and
suggested that lawyers serving on the advisory committees be in­
vited to attend the local Judicial Conferences of the circuits in
which they reside.

     REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL 

                  STATISTICS 

  Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman of the Committee
on Judicial Statistics, reported that the Committee, in reviewing
the need for additional judgeships in the courts of appeals and
                                34 


district courts, had considered the comprehensive statistical data
prepared by the Administrative Office and all other pertinent in­
formation concerning the need for additional judgeships. The
recommendations of the Committee for the creation of additional
judgeships, and Conference action with respect thereto are shown
above.
   The Committee reported as follows concerning the recommen­
dations made by the Committee on Multiple Judge Courts ","ith
reference to the reporting of judicial statistics:
   (1) That the Administrative Office specifically indicate in its
statistical report of cases pending, that land condemnation cases
with multiple tracts and designations, which require separate dis­
position, in reality encompass a number of cases equal to the num­
ber of separate takings.-The Committee was of the view that
since the clerks of the district courts docket each case separately,
it is not feasible to require them additionally to report each tract
separately to the Administrative Office and to require the Ad­
ministrative Office to report each tract separately in the tables
showing civil acions filed, terminated, and pending in each court.
Furthermore land condemnation cases appear to be a major prob­
lem in only a limited number of districts.                           (
   The Committee pointed out that a report concerning pending
land condemnation cases and tracts, based on data received from
the Lands Division of the Department of Justice, is now being
published in the reports of the Director of the Administrative
Office and that the Administrative Office has also adopted the
practice of making special reference to pending land condemna­
tion cases and the number of open tracts in its reports concerning
the judicial business of particular districts, whenever that appears
to be significant. The Committee was, therefore, of the opinion
that the suggested revision of the present method of reporting
land condemnation cases would not serve any useful, general sta­
tistical purpose. The Conference agreed with this view.
   (2) That the statistical reports published by the Administra­
tive Office show the actual ((ready for trial" cases pending before
each court rather than the number of cases that have been filed
and not terminated.-The Committee reported that since infor­
mation concerning the number of cases ((ready for trial" is avail­
able in only a few districts, namely, those districts which require
a certificate of readiness, it would not be desirable to change the
                                                                     (
                                   35 

 present form of the statistical tables. The Conference discussed
 the possibility of publishing in addition to the regularly published
 data information concerning cases "ready for trial" in those dis­
 tricts where such information is available, and directed the Com­
 mittee to consider this proposal further in the light of the dis­
 cussions in the Conference.
    (3) That the work of the district courts be reported by divisions
 as well as by districts in those districts where there are separate
 divisions.-The Committee pointed out that there are 240 offices
 where deputy clerks are located and where cases are filed and
 that to publish information as to each of these offices would add
 greatly to the volume of the tables and diminish their usefulness.
 The Committee was further of the view that the responsibility
 of the judges in a district is for the work of the district as a whole,
 and that the statistics which are published should not be localized
 to confine the responsibility for any part of the district to a judge,
 or a group of the judges. The Conference thereupon approved
 the Committee's statement.
    (4) That in civil jury trials, where a jury has been selected
 or assigned and the proceeding is subsequently settled, that ap­
 propriate credit be given for such jurors.-The Committee pointed
out that the matter of jury costs has been extensively discussed
with the Appropriations Subcommittees of the Senate and House
of Representatives, and they understand that the present figures
include cases where last-minute settlements or pleas have resulted
in a larger than usual number of jurors held in reserve and not
used. The Committee felt that to change the present reporting
system by giving a theoretical credit where jurors were actually
not used might reflect on the factual basis of the statistics, and
that, moreover, it would fail to give due advantage to those dis­
tricts, large and small, where, by calendar control, cooperation of
the bar and the establishment of settlement deadlines, or other
expedients, the instances where jurors are called and not used are
held to a minimum. The Committee was in favor of continuing
the present method of reporting jury statistics. .The Conference
agreed.
   (5) That consideration be given to the value and worth of the
median time formula between issue and triaZ.-The Committee
reported that the median time from issue to trial is probably the
most realistic of the time intervals now used, because it measures
                                  36 

the time from joinder of issue to trial during which the judge
should have complete control of the case and the responsibility for
moving it forward toward disposition. The Committee is presently
giving further consideration to the value and worth of the median
time interval from issue to trial as an indication of docket condi­
tions, and was authorized to consider the matter further as part
of its survey of the overall statistical standards to be used in report­
ing the work of the district courts. The Committee informed the
Conference that, for practical convenience, the annual reports of
the Director of the Administrative Office will hereafter contain an
explanation of the term "median" on each table in which it is
used.
                        SURVEY OF STATISTICS

   Chief Judge Johnsen informed the Conference that the Com­
mittee had reviewed at length the principles and bases of statisti­
cal portrayal which were approved by the Committee prior to its
recent reorganization. The Committee desires to undertake some
further canvassing and evaluation in order to cover the statistical
field as completely as possible before making a restatement of
these principles, and will report thereafter to the Conference.
                                                                           (
     REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PRETRIAL
                  PROCEDURE
  Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Committ:.ee on
Pretrial Procedure, reported to the Conference a continuing in...;
crease in the use of the pretrial conference procedure in the di~trict
courts under Rule 16, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly
among recently appointed district judges. Almost every district
judge now uses the pretria.I conference at least to some extent.
Moreover, figures compiled by the Administrative Office indicate
that pretrial orders defining the issues and reciting agreements
made by the parties are entered in about two-thirds of the total
pretrial conferences held, as required by Rule 16.

STATEMENT OF THE ESSENTIALS OF PRETRIAL AND TRIAL PROCEDURE--­
                         SEMINAR PROGRAMS

   The Committee has planned for several years to prepare a 'con­
cise statement of the essentials of pretrial and trial procedure~ as·
an aid to the district courts in the conduct of judicial business. In'     (
                                     37 

the opinion of the Committee, however, the only practical way of
bringing out in full the views of the judiciary on matters of judi­
cial administration, which the Committee deems vital for the de­
velopment of such a statement, is through the seminar discussion.
The Conference thereupon adopted the following resolution recom­
mended by the Committee:
  That your Committee on Pretrial Procedure, in cooperation with the Com­
mittee on Court Administration be authorized to conduct, at appropriate times
and places, a series of meetings or seminars of judges and lawyers for the
purpose of exploring the most effective techniques for the utilization of the
pretrial and trial procedures contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Pro­
cedure; and that in conjunction with these meetings your Committee be further
authorized to conduct a special study for the purpose of developing a state­
ment of the essentials of pretrial and trial practice for presentation to the
Judicial Conference for its consideration and adoption.

                    CIRCUIT PRETRIAL COMMIT'I'EES

   The Conference in September 1952 (Conf. Rept., p. 21) adopted
a resolution requesting the chief judge of each circuit to appoint
a regular standing committee of his circuit conference on pretrial
procedure, consisting of at least five members and to include both
judges and lawyers, which would be charged with the duty of-
        Ca) Ascertaining the extent and the efficiency of the em­
     ployment of pretrial procedure in the Federal and State courts
     of the circuit;
        (b) Considering appropriate measures to promote its wider
     understanding and use and taking appropriate action; and
        (c) Making an annual written report of its activities and
     of the extent of the employment of pretrial in the circuit to
     the annual conference of the circuit and furnishing a copy
     to the chairman of the national Committee.
  .Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference in­
vited the chief judges of the circuits to reactivate or to reconsti­
tute any circuit pretrial committees that have become inactive,
with the request that the local committees keep the national
Committee informed of their plans and activities.
                        ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES

  Chief Judge Murrah stated the view of the Committee that a
policy of assigning newly appointed district judges for service in
other districts is sound and fully consonant with the statement of
                                 38 

policy adopted by the Advisory Committee on Inter-Circuit As­
signments and approved by the Conference at its March 1960               !
Session (Conf. Rept., p. 32), and that such assignments should
be freely made. The Committee accordingly recommended that
for the purpose of observation and experience district judges be
assigned for judicial service from time to time to districts utilizing
effective methods of pretrial procedure and other improved tech­
niques of judicial administration. This recommendation was
approved by the Conference.
   The Conference received the report of the Committee and
ordered that it be circulated to all members of the Federal.
judiciary.

 REPORT OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON INTER­ 

            CIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS 

   Circuit Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, Chairman of the Advisory
Committee on Inter-Circuit Assignments, submitted a compre­
hensive report of the activities of the Committee under the plan
for the inter-circuit assignment of judges approved by the Con­
ference on March 11, 1960 (Conf. Rept., March 1960, p. 31). In
accordance with the plan, the Committee submitted a list of the (
requests for approval of assignments referred to the Committee
by the Chief Justice after March 11, 1960, or presented directly to
the Committee, together with the recommendations of the Commit­
tee to the Chief Justice. All requests for assignments were ap­
proved by the Committee, except one for which the certificate of
necessity for service was later withdrawn.
   Judge Breitenstein teported that questions have arisen as to
how far in advance assignments should be made and as to the
length of assignments. It was the opinion of the Committee that
while advance planning of assignments is desirable, it should not
recommend any assignment which has a termination date of more
than one year from the date of the consent to the assignment, if
an active judge is involved, or from the date of the expression of
willingness to serve, if a senior judge is involved. Further, the
Committee was of the opinion that assignments of active judges
should not ordinarily exceed six weeks and senior judge assign­
ments should not ordinarily exceed one year.
   With regard to the propriety of inter-circuit assignments for the
disposition of a certain case, the Committee was of the opinion {
                                      39 

    that the need for services in particular cases is a factor which has
(   an important bearing on the question of need, but that at the same
    time the action of the Committee should be based upon service
    related to a particular period of time rather than related to a partic­
    ular matter before a court. The Conference was of the view, how­
    ever, that such assignments may be desirable in some cases, and
    directed that the Committee report be amended by adding the
    following: "Unless the circumstances make it desirable to make
    the recommendation for a particular case."
       Chief Judge Chambers presented a written statement with re­
    spect to the work of the Committee and requested that it be
    included with the records of the Conference. The Conference
    thereupon directed that the Committee's report, together with
    Judge Chambers' statement, be received and filed.
    REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF
                  THE JURY SYSTEM
       Chief Judge Harry E. Watkins, Chairman of the Committee
    on the Operation of the Jury System, presented to the Conference
    the Committee's study on the operation of the jury system, au­
(   thorized by the Conference at its September 1957 session (Conf.
    Rept., p. 33). The Committee expressed the hope that this report
    may serve as a handbook for judges, clerks, and jury commissioners
    for many years, and that the recommendations that have been
    made for improvement in the operation of the jury system may
    bear fruit. The final report was approved by the Conference and
    the Administrative Office was authorized to have it printed and
    circulated immediately to all Federal judges, clerks of district
    courts, jury commissioners, and others upon request.
       The Administrative Office was further authorized to distribute a
    copy of the questionnaire summary, compiled for the Committee
    during the course of its study, to each Justice of the Supreme
    Court, circuit judge, and district judge.
                                LEGISLATION

       Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference re­
    affirmed its approval of the following bills relating to the operation
    of the jury system upon which no action was taken by the 86th
    Congress:
                                 40 

         (1) H.R. 4343, to provide a jury commISSIOn for each
      United States District Court, to regulate its compensation,
      to prescribe its duties and for other purposes.
         (2) H.R. 4157, to increase the compensation of jury com­
      missioners from $5.00 to $10.00 per day with no limit on the
      number of days of service.
         (3) H.R. 11472, to increase the subsistence allowable of
      jurors to $10.00 per day and to limit daily interim travel ex­
      pense payments to the amount of the subsistence allowance.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference re­
affirmed its disapproval of H.R. 591 and H.R. 1095, 86th Congress,
to provide that in a civil case the number of jurors required to
constitute a jury and the number who must agree for a valid ver­
dict shall be determined by the law of the State in which the action
is tried.
                          .JUROR'S CREED

  Chief Judge Watkins informed the Conference that through the
cooperation of Mr. James V. Bennett, Director of the Bureau of
Prisons, the Committee had arranged to have copies of the Juror's
Creed drawn in color beside a background of the Statue of Liberty.
The work is being done by a class in commercial art at the EI Reno (
Reformatory and a copy will be furnished to each district court,
upon its request, to be hung in each jury room.

                       EMPANELMENT DAY

   The Conference at its March 1960 session (Conf. Rept., p. 30)
referred to the Committee for study the divergencies in practice in
paying per diem to jurors on empanelment day. The Committee
found that empanelment day is used in only three districts-the
District of Columbia, and the Northern and Southern Districts of
California-:-and while it was of the view that, wherever practical,
jurors should be used for actual jury service on the first day they
report, it recognizes that the problem in the metropolitan districts
is different than in other districts and that the solution of the
problem should be left to the discretion of the judges of these
courts..
               PAYMENT OF JURORS BY LITIGANTS

  The Committee considered the proposal referred to it by the
Conference at its last session to require the party demanding a        (
                                  41 

jury trial to prepay, at the beginning of each trial day, the per
diem fees to be paid to the jurors and recommended that the pro­
posal be disapproved. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
                    COST OF THE JURY SYSTEM

  The Committee called attention to table J 1 published in the
Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office for
the fiscal year 1960 which shows the number of petit jurors pres­
ent and paid divided into those serving on juries, the number chal­
lenged and the number in reserve. The record of petit juror utili­
zation for 1960, as disclosed in the table, is the best in eight years.
With 90 more trials in 1960 than in 1959, the number of jurors
present declined by 13,000 and the number in reserve and not used
by 24,000. Not only has this resulted in an important saving of
the time of jurors but it also reflects a substantial reduction of
jury costs in spite of the increase in jury trials. The saving has
been in excess of $300,000.
REPORT OF THE- COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRA­
         TION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  Chief Judge William F. Smith, Chairman of the Committee on
the Administration of the Criminal Law, presented the report of
the Committee.
     FEES AND ALLOWANCES OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

  There had been introduced in the 86th Congress a bill, H.R.
2547, to increase the maximum fees that may be earned by a
United States commissioner in one calendar year from $10,500 to
$12,500 and to increase generally the fees payable to the United
States commissioners. Upon recommendation of the Committee
the Conference approved the revised schedule of fees payable to
United States commissioners set forth in the bill.
         JURISDICTION OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

  The Committee reported that H.R. 3218, 86th Congress, would
amend 18 U.S.C. 3401 (a) and (b) with respect to the trial juris­
diction of the United States commissioners by inserting in lieu of
the term "petty offenses" the term Han offense punishable by im­
prisonment for not more than one year or by a fine of not more
                                 42 

than $1,000, or both." The bill retains the provision that a de­
fendant may elect to be tried before the district court, but elimi­
nates from subsection 3401 (b) the requirement that the commis­
sioner apprise the defendant of his right to elect to be tried in the
district court and that he secure from the defendant a signed,
written consent to be tried before the commissioner. The Com­
mittee recommended that the bill be approved with an amend­
ment restoring the requirement that the United States commis­
sioner apprise the defendant of his right to elect to be tried before
the district court and prohibiting him from proceeding to try the
case unless the defendant, after being so apprised, signs a written
consent to be tried before the commissioner. The bill as thus
amended was approved by the Conference.
                     IMMUNITY LEGISLATION

   The proposal contained in H.R. 7392, 86th Congress, would
grant immunity from criminal prosecution when upon order of the
Court a witness is compelled to testify, or to produce evidence be­
fore any grand jury or court of the United States, in a prosecu­
tion under 18 U.S.C. 1951 with respect to interference with com­
merce by threats or violence, or in a prosecution under 29 U.S.C. (
186 with respect to the bribery of a labor representative. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
bill.
   INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORIZED BY STATE LAW

   The Conference considered the report of the Committee with
regard to S. 3340, 86th Congress, which would authorize certain
communications to be intercepted in compliance with State law,
if the interception was made after determination by a State court
that reasonable grounds existed for belief that such interception
might disclose evidence of the commission of a crime. After a
full discussion, the Conference referred the bill to the Committee
for further study.
               MENTALLY INCOMPETENT PRISONERS

   The Attorney General of the United States is presently author­
ized by 18 U.S.C. 4248 to transfer a prisoner committed to his
custody under the authority of Section 4246 or Section 4247 to
the proper authorities of the State of his residence. H.R. 9676, (
                                            43

," 	
       86th Congress, would amend this section to vest in the Attorney
I      General, or his authorized representative, the authority also to
       transfer a mentally incompetent prisoner Uto a hospital or other
       facility with which suitable arrangements have been made for
       his custody and care." Upon recommendation of the Committee,
       the Conference approved the bill.
          Chief Judge Smith informed the Conference that the Com­
       mittee, at the request of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons,
       has undertaken a study of the need for more specific criteria in
       determining competency under 18 U.S.C. 4244 and 4245, the need
       for more specific criteria for determining potential dangerousness
       under 18 U.S.C. 4247, and the need for improved standards of
       procedure.
                             ESCAPE INVOLVING JUVENILES

          The Conference, on recommendation of the Committee, ap­
       proved the provisions of H.R. 11887, 86th Congress, which would
       amend 18 U.S.C. 1073 to provide a lesser punishment for the
       crime of escape, attempt to escape, or instigating or aiding escape,
       where the crime is committed by a person who is under commit­
       ment as a juvenile delinquent, or by a person who is in custody
(      by virtue of a lawful arrest for a violation of any law of the United
       States, not punishable by death or life imprisonment, committed
       before such person's 18th birthday and as to whom the Attorney
       General has not specifically directed the institution of criminal
       proceedings.
                                 FUGrrIVE FELON ACT

         The Conference considered the proposal contained in H.R.
       11889, 86th Congress, to extend the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1073
       to cover flight to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement
       after conviction, for a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime,
       punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year
       and directed that the Committee give further consideration to the
       proposal.
                            INDETERMINATE SENTENCES

         The Committee reported that H.R. 11359, 86th Congress, would
       add a new subsection to 18 U.S.C. 4208, as follows:
          (e) Wben a judgment of conviction is entered and sentence Is imposed :tor
       less than life but for more than five years upon a defendant who has had no
       prior judgment of conviction entered against him, if the trial judge who im­
(
                                       44 

posed the sentence is a resident of a State other than that in which the court
having jurisdiction is located and the court failed to receive or require a report   (
touching the defendant from the United States Probation Office in the district
before imposing sentence and failed to designate in the sentence, as permitted
under subsection (a), when the defendant should become eligible for parole,
such defendant shall be eligible for parole at such time as the Board of Parole
may determine and upon request of such defendant an immediate study shall
be undertaken and made as described in subsection (c).
   It was the opinion of the Committee that this proposal was de­
sirable, but that it should be made applicable to all cases where
the sentencing judge fails to receive or require a presentence re­
port and not merely to those cases where the sentencing judge
is a resident of a State other than that in which the court having
jurisdiction is located. The Conference thereupon adopted the
recommendation of the Committee that the bill be approved with
the omission of the limitation on its applicability.

               VOLUNTARY ADMISSIONS AND CONFESSIONS

  At the suggestion of the Committee, the Conference referred the
proposal contained in S. 3411, 86th Congress, with respect to the
admissibility of voluntary admissions and confessions to the Ad­
visory Committee on Criminal Rules with the request that it be (
made the subject of a joint study by that Committee and the Com­
mittee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.

                          JOINDER OF DEFENDANTS

   It was the view of the Committee that the proposal contained
in H.R. 12923, 86th Congress, to provide that a new trial shall be
granted a defendant upon his motion if during trial the basis for
the original joinder of defendants no longer exists, may have an
effect upon Rule 8(b), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. On
recommendation of the Committee the Conference thereupon re­
ferred the bill to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules with
the request that it be made the subject of a joint study by that
Committee and the Committee on the Administration of the Crimi­
nal Law.
            CONVEYANCE AND DELIVERY OF OBSCENE MATTER

   The Committee recommended that H.R. 10172 and various other
bills introduced in the 86th Congress, to strengthen the criminal
                                                                                     (
                                     45 

    penalties for the mailing, importing or transporting of obscene
    matter, be disapproved because of the objectionable provisions
    requiring the imposition of mandatory terms of imprisonment and
    fine. The Committee noted, however, that there was no objection
    to the proposed range of punishment, if the imposition thereof is
    made permissive and not mandatory. The recommendation was
    approved by the Conference.
                    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

      Judge Smith informed the Conference that the Committee had
    discussed briefly the several problems which arise from the existing
    and propoaed statutory provisions requiring the imposition of
    mandatory minimum sentences and that the Committee would
    undertake a further study of the problem and report thereon to
    the Conference.
                     CONFLICT OF INTEREST     STATUTE~


      The Committee reported that it had been informed that the
    application of the conflict of interest statutes, 18 U.S.C. 281 and
    283, to United States commissioners has created a personnel prob­
    lem in many districts. Out of a total of 500 United States com­
    missioners, there are approximately 300 whose earnings do not
    exceed $1,000 a year and 186 of these are attorneys, many
    of whom prosecute claims against the United States before gov­
    ernment agencies and departments. Resignations among this
    group because of the application of the conflict of interest statutes
    would adversely affect the efforts of the district courts to retain
    the services of competent attorneys. The Committee, therefore,
    recommended a statutory amendment to exempt part-time
    United States commissioners from the application of these stat­
    utes. The recommendation was approved by the Conference.
                           CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

      The Committee reported that n.R. 870, 86th Congress, would
    abolish the death penalty under all laws of the United States ex­
    cept the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and substitute life
    imprisonment in lieu thereof. On motion of Chief Judge SInith,
    the Committee was authorized to continue its study of this
    proposal.

                     GRAND JURY HANDBOOK

   Chief Judge Smith reported that a Federal Grand Jury Hand- (
book, prepared under the auspices of the Section of Judicial Ad­
ministration of the American Bar Association, had been sub­
mitted to the Committee "rith a request that it be approved for
official publication. While there appears to be nothing objec­
tionable in the contents of the handbook, it Wag the view of the
Committee that it would be inappropriate to approve it for official
publication, and therefore, no recommendation concerning it Wag
made.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE USE OF LAND
              COMMISSIONERS
   Chief Judge Royce H. Savage, on behalf of Circuit Judge
Stanley N. Barnes, Chairman of the Ck>mmittee on Land Commis­
sioners, informed the Conference that the Committee had met
and had considered the problem assigned to it. While much in­
formation has been gathered, there are many matters in dispute
which must be investigated. A preliminary report containing
some tentative conclusions of the Ck>mmittee Wag filed with the I
Conference and a definitive and final report will be submitted ,
later.
              INSTITUTES ON SENTENCING
  On motion of Chief Judge Rives, the Conference authorized the
convening of an Institute on Sentencing in the Fifth Circuit pur­
suant to 28 U.S.C. 334 in accordance with the plan and program
prepared by the circuit committee.

                  LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
   At the request of Warran Olney III, Director of the Adminis­
trative Office, the Conference authorized the distribution to the
Federal judiciary of a report prepared by the Administrative
Office on legislation relating to the Judiciary enacted by the 86th
Congress.
                COURT FACILITIES IN GUAM
  The Ck>nference referred to the Director of the Administrative
Office the recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
Circuit that means be provided to obtain adequate court facilities
in Guam.                                                           (
                                47
     CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER ADVISEMENT
   The Administrative Office submitted to the Conference a report
on cases under submission in the courts of appeals and cases and
motions under advisement in the district courts. The report listed
46 cases under submission in the courts of appeals more than 3
months as of September 1, 1960, and 16 cases and motions which
had been held under advisement by the district courts more than
6 months as of that date. Where necessary, these will be brought
to the attention of the circuit councils by the chief judges of the
circuits.
                         COMMITTEES
   On motion of Chief Judge Johnsen, the Conference requested
the Chief Justice, if he sees fit, to appoint a special committee to
make a study and analysis of the legislative history, congressional
expression, legal literature and other available data on the ques­
tion of the powers of the Judicial Councils, under the language of
the last paragraph of 28 U.S.C. 332, and to make a report thereon
to the Conference with its recommendations of what it believes
the Conference can properly do or declare to make those powers
realized and effective.
   On motion of Chief Judge Biggs the Conference authorized the
Chief Justice to reconstitute the Committees on Court Adminis­
tration and Supporting Personnel and directed that the Advisory
Committee of the Conference, heretofore appointed by the Chief
Justice, be continued.

 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 

                         TO 

THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES 

                         BY 

     THE HONORABLE WILLIAM P. ROGERS 

        Attorney General of the United States 



                  Washington, D.C. 

                 September 21, 1960 

                         APPENDIX


   Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Judicial Conference of the
United States:
   It is a privilege again to meet with the members of the Con­
ference and to discuss briefly a few matters of mutual interest.
Omnibus Judgeship Bill
   We are, of course, deeply concerned by the failure of Congress
to create the judgeships recommended by the Conference. We
believe, as you do, that each of the new judgeships is necessary
if the Federal system is to cope with the increased litigation arising
from our expanding population.
   The judgeship bill was among those designated by the Presi­
dent for special consideration at the regular session and again at
the August session of Congress. To remove the bill from politi­
cal considerations, the President assured Congress early in the
year that if the bill were enacted he would make nominations
from qualified candidates drawn from each of the two major
political parties on an equal basis. Later, we requested that Con­
gress enact the bill supported by the Judicial Conference, effective
January 20, 1961. However, as you know, despite the fact that
most of the recommendations for new judgeships had been pend­
ing since 1954, and despite the detailed justification of need made
as to each judgeship, no action was taken on the bill.
Vacancies
   In these circumstances the necessity to maintain the existing
judge power of the Judiciary at full strength becomes all the
more important. At the present time, eleven vacancies exist.
Needless to say we were most disappointed that the nominations
made for four district court judgeships, one each in Hawaii, Massa­
chusetts, Eastern Michigan and Texas, were not confirmed by the
Senate. As to the other seven, most of them are fairly recent,
all but three having come into existence since the end of May.
                                 (51)
                                 52 

Caseload
   Every effort has been made to continue to reduce the backlog {
of cases in which the United States is a party. Overall, our
status today as compared to when we instituted this program in
1954 is most favorable. In total cases and matters pending, we
have effected a reduction of 30,363 items or 41.8 percent.
   The Civil Division again had an excellent year. At the end
of fiscal year 1960, it had reduced its caseload of pending cases
to 13,342, the lowest number in the history of the Division. It
closed 9,085 cases in 1960 as compared with 7,984 in the previous
year. The Division terminated 4,479 suits against the United
States. In these cases a total of $17,600,000 was recovered by
plaintiffs. In the 4,606 cases on behalf of the Government which
were closed, a total of $41,097,000 was recovered.
   On the other hand, a marked increase in other areas, particu­
larly in tax lien and land condemnation cases has resulted in a
slight upturn over a year ago in total pending criminal and
civil cases.
Protracted Cases
   Over the years the trial of protracted cases has been the subject (""~
of much study and discussion. We therefore have received with
much interest the Handbook approved last spring by this Confer­
ence which sets forth recommended procedures for the trial of these
cases. We share the view of the Conference that many obstacles
can be met and overcome by the early identification of the pro­
tracted case and its assignment to one judge for pretrial and trial.
We welcome this comprehensive treatment of the subject and we
wish to assure the Conference that the Department will continue to
cooperate fully with the courts in seeking the means to expedite the
trial of departmental cases of a protracted nature.
   In this connection, the Conference may be interested in our re­
cent experience in the trial of antitrust cases. During fiscal 1960,
thirteen antitrust cases were tried requiring a total of 223 trial
days. In the preceding year, twelve cases were tried requiring a
total of 146 days. Accordingly, for a two-year period the actual
trial days excluding time for pretrial in antitrust cases in which the
Government was involved total 369.
                                          53 

Public Defenders
  Legislation to provide a public defender system for the Federal
court system passed the Senate but unfortunately was not reported
by the House Judiciary Committee (S. 895). However, the status
of this legislation is such as to give hope for favorable action in the
next Congress.
  We were, of course, pleased by the enactment of legislation to
provide for a public defender's office in the District of Columbia.
The $75,000 annual appropriation will not provide for legal assist­
ance to all indigents, a program which it was estimated would
have cost in the neighborhood of $200,000 a year. However, it is
contemplated that the office will conduct investigations, aid in
location of witnesses and provide other substantial assistanc~ to
counsel representing indigent defendants.
Commitments of Defendants for Study and Observation Under
     18 U.S.C. 4208(b)
   We have now had two years of experience under the statute
which provides that the courts may commit adult offenders to
prison for study and observation prior to the fixing of sentence.
  During the period October 7, 1958, when the first commitment
was ordered, and August 8, 1960, the courts made a total of 393
commitments under the Act. It has been used in each Judicial
Circuit and in a total of 46 Judicial Districts.*
   That the courts are apparently satisfied by the way in which this
Act is being administered is indicated by the fact that during the
calendar year 1959 there were an average of approximately 15
defendants committed for study each month; in the months of
June and July 1960 the figure exceeds 30 per month.
  Of the group committed to date, the courts have taken final
action on a total of 283 defendants-55 were placed on probation
after study; 170 were committed under the new statute which
gives the United States Board of Parole authority to establish the
parole eligibility date; 43 were sentenced under the regular sentenc­
ing statute; and most of the remainder were returned to State
jurisdictions for hospitalization. In approximately 80 percent of
the cases, the recommendation of the Director of the Bureau of
Prisons as to the appropriate sentence was adopted by the court.
  ·The distribution of commitment!! by Circuit 18 as follows: First Circuit, 1; Second,
18; Third. 3t; Fourth, 54; Fifth" 64; Sixth, 20; Seventh, :W; Eighth, 4; Ninth, 143;
Tenth, 89 ; District of Columbi8;. 3.
                               54
    The courts are also making use of the provisions of the statute
(18 V.S.C. 4208 (a) (2) which authorizes the Board of Parole (
to fix the parole eligibility date; a total of 642 defendants were
committed under this law during the fiscal year 1960. On the
other hand, the courts have made less frequent use of 4208 (a)(l)
under which a judge may himself set minimum and maximum
terms. Only 71 defendants were sentenced under this provision
during the past fiseal year.
Youth Corrections Act
   There has been a continuing and steady increase in the commit­
ment of youth offenders under the provisions of the Federal Youth
Corrections Act. The increase in the youth population of Federal
institutions was an important factor in the Department's acquir­
ing from the Department of Defense the former Disciplinary
Barracks at Lompoc, California. This modern, well-equipped
institution was activated, primarily as a youth center, early in
August of 1959 and currently has a population of more than 1,000
young men. The Lompoc institution also serves as a study center
for adults and youths committed for observation and study under
18 V.S.C. 4208 (b) and 18 V.S.c. 501O(e), respectively.
   The enactment in August 1958 of the statute (18 V.S.C. 4209)
                                                                 «.
which extends the provisions of the Youth Corrections Act to
selected young offenders between the ages of 22 and 25 has con­
tributed substantially to the number of youth offenders in our
custody< Since the statute became operative, a total of 518 have
been committed under its provisions. During the fiscal year 1960,
280 youths were committed under the provisions of the Extended
Youth Act or 21.5 percent of the approximately 1,300 youth
offenders committed during that year.
   Although there have been some difficulties in the administra­
tion of the Act, on the whole we believe that the program is ful­
filling the objectives contemplated.
Sentencing Institutes
   As envisioned in Public Law 85-752, the Department and the
Bureau of Prisons have participated actively in the various circuit
sentencing institutes held during the past year.
   The Department feels that the sentencing institute program is a
worthwhile and essential contribution to the administration of
justice in the Federal system and we will continue to do our part t~,
                                     55 

    in making this program successful. We have already discussed
    with representatives of the Judicial Conference and the Admin­
    istrative Office of the Courts the mutual interest in another sen­
    tencing institute on the national level, somewhat similar to that
    held in Boulder, Colorado, in the summer of 1959. A national
    institute serves a very useful purpose in integrating and coordinat­
    ing the efforts of the several circuits in working toward their
    objective, as stated by the Congress, of formulating "sentencing
    principles and criteria which will aggist in promoting the equitable
    administration of the criminal laws of the Un ted States." If the
    Judicial Conference approves the tentative plan to hold another
    national sentencing institute in 1961, we, of course, will extend our
    full cooperation.
    President's Conference on Administrative Procedure
       The Department is pleased to note that Chief Judge Prettyman,
    who so excellently chaired the first President's Conference on Ad­
    ministrative Procedure, has been designated by the President to
    serve as temporary chairman of the renewed conference. We sin­
    cerely hope that the Administrative Conference will attain the
    stature and usefulness of the conferences which have come to be
(   an integral part of our judicial system. Our office of Administra­
    tive Procedure will be pleased to cooperate with the organizing
    committee and ~ wish to assure you the full support of the Depart­
    ment in this important undertaking.
    Honor Program
       Finally, a word about our Honor Program in which we select
    outstanding young law school graduates based solely on their rec­
    ords. Since its establishment in 1954, a total of 355 select law
    graduates from 76 law schools located in 40 States and the District
    of Columbia have been recruited. As of today, approximately
    210 honor recruits or 60 percent of the total are still with the
    Department.
      As you know, we attempt to provide these young lawyers with
    a general background in government litigation, with particular
    emphasis on courtroom experience, and a majority of these law­
    yers have argued in the courts throughout the country. I am
    pleased to say that the judges share our enthusiasm for the pro­
    gram and that practically all comments concerning their legal
    capabilities and demeanor have been favorable.
                               56 

  The program has been most effective in providing the Depart­
ment with some of the ablest young legal talent in the country. ( .
We believe in its long range effectiveness, and we hope that it will .
continue to be a major and permanent recruiting source for the
Department of Justice in the years ahead.
