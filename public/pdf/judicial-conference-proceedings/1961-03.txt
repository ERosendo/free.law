        COMMUNICATION FROM THE PRESIDENT
             OF THE UNITED STATES
                                                   THE WHITE HOUSE,
                                             WASHINGTON,   March   14,   1961.

Mr. CHIEF JUSTICE, MEYBERS OF THE JUDICIAL OONFERENCE:
   This is my first opportunity as President to greet the members of the United
States JUdicial Conference. I regret that the press of matters has foreclosed
the opportunity I had anticipated of seeing and talking with you personally.
   I understand that your two-day meeting has been fruitful, and I rejoice
with you in the word that an important goal set by the conference appears
on the way to achievement when legislation, which has passed in the Senate.
is enacted to increase the number of federal judges throughout the country.
I believe with you that the new judgeships are essential if the federal system"
is to continue to cope with the increase of lltigation caused by our expanding i J
                                          3

    population. You may be sure that careful attention will be given to the selec­
    tion of incumbents when the new positions are authorized to the end that
(
    the high regard in which the Federal Judiciary is held will be maintained.
    I would hope that much of the spade work will have been done in processing
    these selections before your conference meets in Washington again.
       I want to assure you of my continuing interest in matters which are of
    mutual concern to us and of my support of cooperative efforts between the
    judicial and executive branches which will result in advancing the high objec­
    tive of equal justice under law toward which we all strive.

                                                             JOlIN   F.   KENNEDY.


              REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
       Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, on invitation of the Chief
    Justice, spoke to the Conference informally on matters relating
    to the business of the courts of the United States. Among other
    things, he expressed the Department's interest in the proper ad­
    ministration of the jury system. While the selection of qualified
    jurors is the responsibility of the Judiciary, the Department of
    Justice is also deeply concerned because any successful attack on
     the administration of the jury system necessarily has serious and
     far-reaching consequences for litigation handled by the Depart­
    ment.
       The Attorney General stated he wished to call to the attention
    of the Conference the allegations being made in several districts
    at the present time that jurors are not being properly selected and
    impanelled, and there have been incidents in past years when
    considerable numbers of unqualified persons actually have been
    selected for jury duty. He said he was aware that the Conference
    recently approved a report of its Committee on the Operation of
    the Jury System, to be made public very shortly, and that he
    hoped that the Conference and the Judiciary generally would
    make every effort to bring the administration of the system in
    every district up to the standards recommended in the report,
    thus making sure that the administration of the system would not
    be open to question.
       Later, during the course of its session, the Conference considered
    this matter. The Conference instructed the Director of the Ad­
    ministrative Office to consult and cooperate with the Attorney
    General, and to bring to the attention of the appropriate chief
    judge any instance which might be found where procedures in
    administering the jury system appeared to be open to any possible
    question.

         COMMUNICATION OF THE CHAIRMAN 

           COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY 

            HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

   Honorable Emanuel Celler, Chairman of the Committee on
the Judiciary, notified the Chief Justice that he was unable to
attend personally the Session of the Judicial Conference and re­
quested that a letter he had addressed to the Chief Justice as Pre­
siding Officer be read to the Conference. Mr. Celler's letter was
read by Mr. William R. Foley, General Counsel of the Committee.
   Chairman Celler's letter stated that he was gratified to learn
that a special committee had been appointed to study the matter
of organization and power of the Judicial Councils of the Circuits
and that he looked forward with much interest to the Committee's
report, which he understood would be presented at this session.
He said that his concern over the activities of the Judicial Council
had arisen from personal experiences as Chairman of the Judiciary
Committee. Problems relating to judicial administration had not
infrequently been presented to him as Chairman of the Judiciary
Committee which, in his opinion, should not have been permitted
to arise and would, he felt sure, never have come to the attention
of the Congress if the Judicial Councils had discharged the respon- f )
sibilities and exercised the powers conferred upon them by
Section 332 of Title 28, United States Code.
  Without wishing to dwell on specific instances or individuals,
the Chairman stated that over the course of the years several of
these matters had caused great concern, and had created an under­
tone of dissatisfaction with the work of the Judicial Councils which
had caused him to present the problem to the Judicial Conference.
The Chairman stated that he had actively participated in proc­
essing the statute in 1939 which created the Judicial Councils and
he entertained no doubt whatsoever of the legislative intent in
enacting the law. He said that he understood that since that time
doubt had arisen in the minds of at least some members of the
federal judiciary about the scope of Section 332 and the intent
of its language. The Chairman stated he wished to assure the
Conference that the broad language of the statute was deliberate,
and was intended to provide the necessary elasticity to enable the
Judicial Councils to deal with the numerous and varied problems
relating to the management and administration of the courts
which the Congress knew would be bound to arise.                     { '\
                                                                      ,j
                                              5
         The Congress believed, the Chairman said, that the Judicial
      Councils of the Circuits would best know local conditions, needs
      and problems and the most appropriate actions and remedies, and
      it intended, consequently, to confer on the Councils broad author­
      ity to take whatever action and to apply such remedies as were
     necessary and most appropriate. Certainly the Congress had never
     intended the powers conferred on Judicial Councils to lie dormant.
         The Chairman stated he felt there was an urgent and immediate
     need for the Judicial Councils to function as Congress had intended.
     He hoped the federal judges would resolve any doubts there might
     be as to the scope of authority under the existing law and would
     make recommendations if corrective legislation is needed. On the
     other hand, if the Conference concluded that the authority of the
     present statute is adequate, Judicial Councils should act fully and
     effectively without further questioning as to legislative authority.
     He concluded by emphasizing his conviction that prompt effective
     action by Judicial Councils on all of the many problems of judicial
     administration was necessary and was desired by the Congress, and
     that if appropriate and effective action was not taken by the
     Judicial Branch on these matters the default would have to be
     remedied by the Congress.

          Chairman Eastland requested that the proposed legislation be
        placed before the Conference for its consideration, and that a re­
        port of the Conference action be forwarded to the Committee on
        the Judiciary at the earliest convenient time.
          The bill was referred to the Committee on Court Administration
        for study and report to the Conference.

                                 JUDICIAL BUSINESS
                                 CIRCUITS AND DlSTlUCTS

    «      The chief judge of each circuit, with the district judge from the
     . circuit, made reports on the state of the judicial business and re­
       lated matters in the courts in each circuit.
           The reports generally cited unduly heavy backlogs of cases,
       lengthy delays in the disposition of judicial business, the need
       for additional judicial as.sistance, and, in some instances, the need
       for additional supporting personnel to handle the continued
       heavy filings of cases.
           Nationally, the trend in litigation is continuing upwa.rd. A com­
       parison of the demands upon the courts this year with those of
       a year even as recent as 1950 produces a striking contrast in the
       growth of judicial business and the increase in federal judgepolwer.
           In 1950, private civil eases-which by far are the most burden­
       some-accounted for 22,600 of the total cases filed in the 86 dis­
       tricts; by 1960 this number had risen to 30,048, an increase of 33
       percent. This increase would have been still larger except for
       the effect which the Jurisdiction Act of 1958 had on private case
       filings. In fiscal 1958, the last full year before the Act became
       effective, 37,725 private cases were filed in the 86 districts.
    ,/' On June 30, 1950, there were 27,771 private civil cases pending;
    Lly June 30, 1960, the backlog of private civil cases had climbed
       to 40,932, an increase of nearly 50 percent.
                                 8

   Yet, between the years 1950 and 1960, the number of all district( -',
judgeships only increased from 221 to 245, an increase of 11 per­
cent, for an increase of only 24 judges for the entire nation.
   In the Courts of Appeals, it is seen that in 1950 they received
2,830 cases and, by 1960, they received 3,899 cases, an increase of
over 38 percent. The cases pending in the courts of appeals on
June 30, 1950, were 1,675; by June 30, 1960, the cases pending
totalled 2,220, or an increase of 33 percent.
   During this ten-year period, only 3 circuit judgeships were
created for the entire nation, making a total of 68, or an increase
of less than 5 percent.
   More current is the experience reported over the last six months
of 1960-July through December.
Di1Jtrict Courts
   The district courts had 61,251 civil cases pending on July 1,
1960. During the next six months, 28,425 civil cases were filed,
but only 25,928 terminated. Thus, filings outstripped termina­
tions and, as a result, the total number of civil cases awaiting
action on January 1 was 63,748, or an increase of 2,497 over July 1.
   On the criminal side, 7,691 were pending on July 1. Durini)
the period 13,703 cases were filed, and 13,283 were terminated by
final disposition, leaving a total of 8,144 cases pending on Decem­
ber 31, an increase of 453.
   Thus, during the six month's period-due largely, of course, to
seasonal factors-the United States District Courts experienced
an increase of 3,285 cases, and on January 1 of this year, faced a
combined civil-criminal backlog of 71,992 cases.
Courts of Appeals
   The Courts of Appeals are confronted with the largest backlog
in a decade. Filings during the period from July 1 through De­
cember 31, 1960, increased 12112 percent to 2,182 cases, compared
to 1,9'39 cases filed during the same months a year ago. At the
same time, the number of cases disposed of increased from 1,599
to 1,759. Nevertheless, 400 fewer cases were disposed of than
were filed, and the pending caseload rose during the six-month
period from 2,220 cases on July 1, 1960, to 2,643 on December 31,
1960. This represents an increase in the pending caseload of 423
cases, or almost 20 percent, and even though this may be attrib­
uted in large measure to seasonal variations, it points to the COIf )
tinuing pressure of heavy caseloads.                              \j

Court of Claims
   Chief Judge Marvin Jones of the United States Court of Claims
also reported the accumulation of a backlog of cases. The back­
log may be traced to the vast increase in the amount and scope
of Government activities since the Korean War which, as would
be expected, has been accompanied by an increase in the volwn.e
and complexity of cases filed in the Court of Claims.
   It is the view of the judges of the Court that substantial inroads
upon and the ultimate elimination of this backlog can be accom­
plished by providing the Court of Claims with trial and appellate
divisions as they have proposed in a bill, S. 1235, pending in the
Senate and presently under consideration by the Committees on
Court Administration and Revision of the Laws of the Judicial.
Conference.
                    SERVICE OF SENIOR JUDGES

  The chief judges of the circuits, and the district judges, ex­
pressed much appreciation for the contribution of Senior Judges
who are continuing to render substantial judicial services in the
United States Courts.
  As a consequence, the Conference adopted. the following:

                            RESOLUTION
    Resolved, that the Judicial Conference of the United States
    expresses its deep appreciation for the significant contribu­
    tion which senior judges continue to make to the effective
    functioning of our courts, as they have done in the past. In
    many instances, the task of the active judges would have
    been quite impossible without such help in the dispatch of
    judicial business. The Conference gratefully acknowledges
    the debt of the Judiciary to each of the senior judges who
    have rendered such service, and directs that a copy of this
    resolution be sent to each of our senior brethren.

       THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS
  The reports presented to the Conference by the judges of the
courts of appeals and the district courts underscored again the
urgent need for the creation of additional judgeships. While the
Conference, in cooperation with the courts, has consistently pressed
administrative improvements to lessen the impact of heavy case
                                     10 


filings, it is patently clear that such actions have a limited effect
and that they cannot obviate the necessity for increased
judgepower.
    With this background, the Conference gave full consideration
to the exhaustive reports filed by the two committees responsible
for the initial studies and documentation of requests for additional
judgeships: the Qommittee on Judicial Statistics, under the chair­
manship of Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen of the Eighth Circuit,
and the CDmmittee on CDurt Administration, under the chairman­
ship of Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., of the Third Circuit.
   The Conference renewed the previous recommendations made to
the Congress for the creation of new judgeships.

                      NEW PROPOSALS ApPROVED

   The evidence of the mounting judicial business presented by
the Committees on Statistics and Court Administration neces­
sitated the Conference recommending the creation of the following
district judgeships not previously recommended:
   One additional judgeship for the Northern District of California
   Two additional judgeships for the Southern District of California
   One additional judgeship for the Northern District of Indiana               (   --"j",
   One additional judgeship for the Southern District of Indiana
   One additional judgeship for the Eastern and Western Districts of
    Louisiana
   One additional judgeship for the Western District of Missouri
   One additional judgeship for the Eastern District of North Carolina
   One additional judgeship for the Northern District of Texas
   One additional judgeship for the Eastern and Western Districts of
    Washington
  With these additions, the following recapitulation is made of
the requests being transmitted to the Congress:

                           ADVITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  The Conference further recommends: that the existing tem­
porary judgeships in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the
Middle District of Georgia and the District of New Mexico be
made permanent; that the existing roving judgeship in the State
of Washington be made a judgeship for the Western District of
Washington only.
   There are at present 68 jUdgeships in the Courts of Appeals.
The Judicial Conference recommends the creation of 9 additional
judgeships which, if approved, would bring the number of such
judgeships to 77. There are 245 district judgeships; the Con­
ference recommends the creation of 60 additional judgeships
which, if approved, would bring the number to 305.
                        PROPOSALS NOT APPROVED

  Additional proposals for the creation of circuit and district ( )
judgeships, originating in the Congress and in the courts, were
carefully examined by both the committees and the Conference.
However, it was determined that the statistical and factual data
presented in support of these requests did not merit favorable
action by the Conference, and the proposals were not approved.
                TIME STUDY OF THE WORKLOAD OF
                          UNITED STATES JUDGES

   The Chairman of the Committee on Judicial Statistics, Chief
Judge Johnsen, reported the completion of the sixth Time Study,
one of a series to determine from actual experience the relative
time required of district judges to handle the various types of
litigation.
   The studies, first inaugurated in 1946, are conducted by the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts under the gen­
eral direction of the Committee on Judicial Statistics.
   They are made possible by the cooperation of district judges
who keep daily diaries, detailing the time spent and the nature of
                                                                                 ()
                                      13 

     work involved, in the courtroom and in chambers on the various
     types of cases.
        The current report combines the data collected during the fifth
     Time Study (1955) and the sixth Time Study (1958), for a total
     of 26,385 hours of judicial time available for analysis, reported by
     57 district judges representing 39 districts.
        The most important conclusions from these studies are the de­
     terminations (1) that a private civil action, on the average, is about
     three times as burdensome to the court as a civil action to which
     the United States Government is a party; (2) that personal in­
     jury litigation is now consuming approximately one-third of the
     time devoted to civil cases; (3) that criminal cases are consuming
     about one-quarter of the time which the courts spend on allliti­
     gation; and (4) that the caseload per judgeship figures of them­
     selves are, in most instances, a reasonably reliable and sound
     gauge of the workload of the district courts.
       'I'he report is included in the Annual Report of the Director of
     the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for 1960.
             ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS AND DIVISIONS
(~      The Conference had presented to it, in the form of legislation,
     various proposals for the creation of new judicial districts and
     the formation of new divisions within existing districts.
        No new districts have been created since 1928, and this is due
     largely to a recognition of the disadvantages normally accruing
     with the creation of a new district; over-compartmentalization
     and uneconomic operation.
        As long ago as 1948, the danger of further compartmentalization
     and costly operations was brought to the attention of the Con­
     ference by its Committee on Ways and Means of Economy in
     Operation in the Federal Courts. That Committee, it is worth
     noting, not only did not approve of the creation of additional dis­
     tricts, but it suggested that action be taken looking forward to
     consolidating existing judicial districts within a single state. The
     Committee report contained the following conclusion:
             "Consideration of the problem convinces us that definite
           action [to consolidate districts within a single state] should
          be taken, not only as a matter of economy, but also as a
          matter of efficiency in the administration of the courts...•
          Consolidation would be advantageous for the following
          reasons:
                              14
       1. It would unify and integrate the work of the federal
     courts administering the law of the state and lead to a more ( )
    efficient and fairer use of the judicial manpower available.
       2. It would eliminate much inconvenience to parties and
    many troublesome questions of venue if all federal courts
    within a state had statewide jurisdiction.
       3. It would result in savings in the operation of the clerks',
    marshals' and United States attorneys' offices which would
    run into hundreds of thousands of dollars in the aggregate."
  The Conference was not requested to take any specific action
toward consolidation of existing districts but, as a result of the
study, the Conference did approve the following resolution:
                          RESOLUTION
        Be it resolved, That, henceforth, the Judicial Conference of
     the United States will definitely oppose the creation of any
     additional judicial district; and, where it is found that addi~
     tional judicial service is necessary, it will recommend that
     such service be provided by the creation of additional judg~
     ships within the then existing judicial districts.
   The Conference, at its session in September 1955, and on su~ ( )
sequent occasions, has reaffirmed the resolution in opposition to
the creation of additional judicial districts.
  With this background, and based upon the recommendation of
the Committee on Judicial Statistics and the Committee on Court
Administration, the Conference resolved to adhere to its previous
policy, and to declare general disapproval of the various proposals
for the creation of additional districts and, also, of new divisions
in existing judicial districts.
                COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration, Chief
Judge Biggs, also reported on the following matters within the
jurisdiction of the Committee:
                   PLACES OF HOLDING CoURT

   Several proposals which would provide new places for holding
court have been received, but the Committee was of the view that
it was without adequate data to evaluate fairly these requests. (   -c
They are:
                                     15

            (1) H.R. 4312, 87th Congress, to provide that court for the
          Northeastern Division of the Northern District of Alabama
         be held at Decatur, as well as at Huntsville.
             (2) H.R. 2575, 87th Congress, to provide that court for the
          District of Connecticut be held at Bridgeport, as well as at
         Hartford and New Haven, provided that the number of
          judgeships shall exceed two and that accomodations at Bridge­
         port shaH be without expense to the United States.
            (3) H.R. 2503, 87th Congress, to provide that court for the
         District of Connecticut shall be held at Bridgeport and Water­
         bury, as well as at Hartford and New Haven.
            (4) H.R. 3335, 87th Congress, to provide that court for the
         Southern District of Illinois shall be held at Alton, as well as
         at Quincy and Springfield.
            (5) H.R. 328, 87th Congress, to provide that a term of
         court for the Western District of Michigan be held at Lan­
         sing instead of Mason.
       The Conference directed that the proposals be forwarded to the
    respective Judicial Councils of the circuits with the request that
    the councils report their views to the Committee as soon as con­
(   venient. The Committee was authorized to inform the Congres­
    sional Committees of the views of the respective Judicial Councils
    of the circuits with respect to these bills.
       In this connection, it may be well to note that proposals to es­
    tablish new places of holding court have been a matter of long­
    standing concern to the Judicial Conference. In fact, the report
    of the Committee on Ways and Means of Economy in the Opera­
    tion of the Federal Courts, filed with the Conference in September,
    1948, concluded:
            "... it is clear that, throughout the country, court is now
         required to be held in many places where such a service is en­
         tirely unnecessary and wasteful of time and money."
       Recent studies by the Administrative Office of the United States
    Courts suggest that this conclusion is as valid today as it was in
    1948 when the Committee on Economy reported to the Conference.
           ACCOMMODATIONS AT      PLACES   FOR HOLDING    CoURT
      Additional legislative requests were received for the views of
    the Conference with respect to the following proposals for waiving
    the limitations and restrictions of 28 U.S.C. 142.
                                 16
         (1) H.R. 411, 87th Congress, proposing the waiving of 28
      U.S.C. 142 and the providing of court facilities for the West­
      ern District of Michigan at Kalamazoo.
         (2) H.R. 114, 87th Congress, proposing the waiving of 28
      U.S.C. 142 and the providing of court facilities for the Eastern
      District of North Carolina at Fayetteville.
   The Committee on Court Administration was directed to for­
ward the bill H.R. 411 to the Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit
for an expression of its views and, following its receipt and study,
to file a report at the next session of the Conference.
   The Conference approved H.R. 114.
   With respect to the future procedure, the Conference reaffirmed
its action of September 1960 [Con£. Rept., p. 28] which requires
the Director to transmit all proposals for additional court facilities
to the judicial council of the appropriate circuit for its considera­
tion and to request the General Services Administration to pro..
vide such facilities only if, and after, they have been approved as
necessary by the judicial council of the circuit.
   In this connection, the Conference in considering the report on
Revision of the Laws affirmed its action of September 1960, and
approved the proposal now contained in H.R. 113 which would              ~   )
amend 28 U.S.C. 142 so as to make it clear that the Section does
not prohibit the General Services Administration from altering or
remodelling an existing Federal building in order to provide ac­
commodations for holding court in a place which the respective ju­
dicial council approves as justified, where Congress has specifically
authorized sessions of the district court to be held, but where no
court facilities have previously been provided.
           REORGANIZATION OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS

   The draft of a bill to reorganize the Court of Claims by estab­
lishing separate trial and appellate divisions had been submitted
to the Committees on Court Administration and Revision of the
Laws for their joint consideration. The Committees reported,
after some discussion, that while a need was shown to exist for re­
vising and improving the administration of the Court of Claims,
further study was necessary.
   The Conference, after appropriate consideration, returned the
draft bill to the Committees and directed that a subcommittee be
appointed to study the proposal, including the problems discussed        (j
                                     17 

     in the Conference concerning the separate and concurrent juris­
     diction of the district courts and the Court of Claims.

              REPRESENTATION AT THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE

        H.R. 	176, 87th Congress, would amend the first paragraph of 28
     U.S.C. 331 to provide that the Chief Justice shall summon the
     Chief Judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the
     Chief Judge of the Customs Court to participate in the delibera­
     tions of the Judicial Conference of the United St.ates. The Con­
     ference was informed that the Court of Customs and Patent Ap­
     peals desired to be included, and was willing to waive its special
     budgetary position provided in 28 U.S.C. 605 and have its budget
     reviewed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, as is the
     budget of the Court of Claims.
        The Conference also was informed that the Customs Court did
     not wish to be included in the Conference.
        The Conference approved H.R. 176 with amendments striking
     the phrase "the Chief Judge of the Customs Court" and providing
     that the phrase "the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and"
     be stricken from the second paragraph of 28 U.S.C. 605, so as to
(	   provide that the Chief Judge of the Court of Customs and Patent
     Appeals shall be a member of the Judicial Conference of the United
     States and the budget of that court be subject to approval by the
     Judicial Conference.

               JURY TRIALS IN LAND CONDEMNATION CASElS

        H.R. 126, 87th Congress, would provide that notwithstanding
     the provisions of Rule 71A(h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro­
     cedure, any party to an action involving the exercise of the power
     of eminent domain under the laws of the United States may have
     a trial by jury on the issue of just compensation, except where a
     special tribunal MS been set up by Congress to determine that
     issue.
        The Conference was of the view that this proposal (1) would
     unduly interfere with the administration of justice in certain dis­
     trict courts and because of the character, location, or quantity of
     the property to be condemned cause delay in the trial of civil
     cases, and (2) would interfere unnecessarily with the rule making
     power conferred on the Supreme Court by the Act of June 19, 1934.
(
                              18 

The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, disap­
proved the bill.
                 REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Senior Circuit Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Com­
mittee on Revision of the Laws, submitted a comprehensive
report.
  1. The Conference gave its specific approval, to the extent in­
dicated, to the following bills pending in the 87th Congress, which
would carry out proposals approved, in whole or in part, at pre­
vious sessions by the Conference:
         (a) H.R. 113, specifically to authorize the General Serv­
     ices Administration to remodel under 28 U.S.C. 142, federal
     buildings to provide court quarters therein for the first time
      (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1960, p. 28).
         (b) H.R. 187, providing judicial review of administrative
     deportation orders and orders of exclusion. The Conference
      approved similar bills at its September 1959 and September
      1960 sessions insofar as they related to the judicial review of
      deportation orders. Noting, however, that these bills limited
      the review of orders of exclusion to review by writs of habeas
      corpus, which would seem to deny any review of their ex- ( ')
      elusion to nonresident aliens (who are not in custody), the
      Conference expressed no opinion with respect to the proposed
      limitation (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1959, p. 8; id., Sept.. 1960, p.
      30). The same limited approval was given to H.R. 187.
         (e) H.R. 465, to provide that where applications are made
      to the court of appeals for interlocutory relief against orders
      of certain administrative agencies, reasonable notice (instead
      of a mandatory five days' notice as at present) must be given
      to the agency (Conf. Rept. Sept. 1956, p. 45; Coni. Rept.
      Sept. 1957, p. 35).
         (d) H.R. 836, requiring that proposed consent decrees in
      antitrust cases be published in the Federal Register at least
      thirty days prior to their entry. The requirement would ap­
      ply to orders entered by a district court and in proceedings
    . by any board or commission for the enforcement of the Clay­
      ton Act or the Federal Trade Commission Act (Conf. Rept.•
      Sept. 1959, p. 35).
         (e) H.R. 843, extending the registration of judgments
      provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1963 to the judgments of territorial ( )
                                 19 

     courtB, and broadening the cited section so 88 to make it ap­
     plicable to those portions of divorce decrees which provide for
     the payment of money or the transfer of property (Conf.
     Rept., Sept. 1957, pp. 37-38), 28 U.S.C. 1963 presently pro­
     vides that final money or property judgments entered in a
     district court may be registered in any other district court,
     but this has been held not to be applicable to the judgments
     of territorial courts or to divorce decrees.
        (f) H.R. 1184, to provide judicial review of agency orders
     concerning biological products. At the present time the Sec­
     retary of Health, Education and Welfare has the power of
     refusing to issue, or to suspend or revoke, licenses for estab­
     lishments manufacturing or preparing biological products.
     The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the type of review
     proposed by the bill. (Conf. Rept. Sept. 1960, p. 29).
        (g) H.R. 1247 and S. 701, to permit actions on tort claims
     to be brought in the judicial district in which the act or omis­
     sion occurred. At present, 28 U.S.C. 1391 pennits these suits
     to be brought only in the districts of the residence of the
     defendant and the plaintiff. S. 701, while otherwise identical
(	   to H.R. 1247, contains an additional provision permitting suit
     against any person or corporation in any judicial district which
     is the residence of a state official who, by operation of state
     law rather than by actual appointment, becomes the agent
     of that person or corporation to receive service of process.
     The Conference approved the bills only if amended so as to
     strike the additional provision noted above (Conf. Rept. Mar.
     1949, p. 30).
        (h) H.R. 1783, providing that the Director of the Admin­
     istrative Office may authorize cost of living allowances for
     judicial employees stationed outside the continental United
     States or in Alaska or Hawaii. Such allowances may not
     exceed 25% of the basic rate of compensation (Conf. Rept.
     Mar. 1959, p. 29).
        (i) S. 20 and H.R. 1960, amending 28 U.S.C. 85 so 88 to
     provide (a) that district courts shall have original juris­
     diction of actions to compel officers or employees of the United
     States (or agencies thereof) to perfonn their duty, (b) that
     civil actions in which each defendant is an officer or employee
     of the United States or any agency thereof, for an act done

     11911091-61--4
                                   20
      in the defendant's official capacity or under color of legal au­
      thority, may be brought in any judicial district where a plain­
      tiff to the action resides, or in which the cause of action arose,
      or in which any property in the action is situated, and (c)
      that the summons and complaint may be delivered to the
     officer or agency involved by certified mail beyond the terri­
      torial limits of the district in which the action is brought
       (Conf. Rept. Sept. 1960, pp. 27-28),
         (j) H.R. 5342, permitting the assignment of retired judges
      of territorial courts t.o active judicial service provided (a) that
      the retired judge consents to the assignment, and (b) that he
      is not engaged in the practice of law (Conf. Rept. Sept. 1956,
      pp. 43-44; Coni. Rept., Mar. 1959, p. 30).
          (k) H.R. 5344, relating to the jurisdiction of the district
     courts in actions commenced by fiduciaries by reason of diver­
     sity of citizenship. It seems that a practice has arisen in some
     districts of procuring the appointment of a nonresident fidu­
     ciary for a decedent or minor having a claim against a local
     resident, in order to create diversity of citizenship. The bill
     would withdraw federal jurisdiction in such cases (Coni. Rept.
     Sept. 1959, pp. 8-9).                                                ( ~)
         (I) H.R. 775 and H.R. 849, both of which would establish
      a Court of Veterans' Appeals and prescribe its jurisdiction and
     functions. The proposed court would review veterans' claims.
      Its decisions would be final and not subject to review by any
      other court. Relying upon indications that the future volume
     of veterans' claims will be so great as to render impracticable
      review by the normal judicial process, the Conference at its
      September 1960 session approved a similar bill as to the type
      of judicial review proposed. Since the Court of Veterans'
      Appeals would be wholly independent and not subject to
      supervision on writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court, how­
      ever, the C-onference disapproved that portion of the earlier
     bill which would include the proposed new court among the
      courts of the United States and require the Director of the
      Administrative Office to assume responsibility for its admin­
      istrative affairs (Coni. Rept., pp. 31-32). The same limited
      approval was given to H.R. 775 and H.R. 849.
   2. The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the following legis­
lative proposals, heretofore approved, which are to be introduced .~
at an early time in the 87th Congress:·                                   ( )
                           21 

   (a) That 28 U.S.c. 603 be amended to increase the salary
of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts to $22,500 per annum and of the Deputy Di­
rector to $20,000 per annum (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1958, p.
40). Although not separately introduced, this proposal Was
included in S. 912, the Omnibus Judgeship Bill, by the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary.
   (b) That all federal judges and libraries of the courts of
appeals be furnished with copies of the Congressional Record
free of charge, when requested (Conf. Rept., Mar. 1959, p.
29).
   (c) That life tenure be provided for the United States dis­
trict judge for the District of Puerto Rico (Conf. Rept., Mar.
1959, p. 29).
   (d) That judgments of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico
be reviewed directly by the Supreme Court of the United
States, rather than by the United States Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1957, p. 40).
   (e) That present statutes which require the holding of
formal terms of court be repealed and that it be provided that
courts shall be in continuous session (Conf. Rept., Mar. 1960,
pp.34-36).
   (f) That the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act be amended
so as to accord with present statutory provisions applicable
to surviving dependents of members of Congress. The
Judicial Survivors Annuity Act, as drafted, was intended to
make available to surviving dependents of federal judges the
same benefits, on the same terms, as those available to the
survivors of deceased members· of Congress. A few days be­
fore enactment of the Judicial Survivors Annuity System,
however, Congress revised and liberalized its own program.
The Civil Service Retirement Act amendments of 1956 with
respect to survivorship benefits for dependents of members
of Congress eliminated the requirement that a widow without
dependent children be fifty years of age before receiving a
widow's annuity, increased the annuity payable to dependent
children, liberalized the formula for computing the widows
annuity in respect to certain civilian service, and increased
the maximum widows' annuity to 40% of the decedents' five­
year average salary (Corif. Rept., Mar. 1960, p. 36) ..
                                22
         (g) That the period of service required to render judges of
      the territorial district courts eligible for retirement benefits be
      reduced from ten to eight years. Such judges would thus be
      eligible for retirement benefits, if otherwise qualified, after
      serving one term of appointment (Con£. Rept., Mar. 1960,
      pp.38-39).
   3. The Conference directed that H.R. 75, 87th Congress, which
would amend 28 U.S.C. 2103 with respect to appeals to the Su­
preme Court of the United States, be transmitted to the Supreme
Court as a matter for its consideration.
   4. H.R. 516, 87th Congress, would confer jurisdiction upon the
Court of Claims to review de novo claims for benefits and pay­
ments under the laws administered by the Veterans Adminis­
tration, while H.R. 282, H.R. 3814, and H.R. 3815, 87th Congress,
would permit judicial review by the district courts of decisions of
the Board of Veterans' Appeals in compensation and pension
claims. The Conference disapproved the types of review pro­
posed by these bills, since they are inconsistent with review by
a special Court of Veterans' Appeals (see 1 (l), supra, p. 20).
   5. The Conference disapproved the following bills, pending in
the 87th Congress, which embody proposals previously disap-)
proved by the Conference:
         (a) H.R. 842 and H.R. 1260 would authorize members of
      the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States to practice
      before the courts of appeals and the district courts. The
      proposal would deprive the lower courts of all control over
      the admission to their bars of lawyers who had previously
      been admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court (Conf. Rept.,
      Sept. 1956. pp. 42-43; id" Mar. 1957, pp. 26-27 i id" Mar.
      1959, p. 31).
         (b) H.R. 2482 would authorize the granting of continu­
      ances in district courts to members of state legislatures in
      accordance wi.th state law. Members of the bar of the fed­
      eral courts who are also members of state legislatures thus
      would not be subject to the usual rules governing the or­
      derly conduct of the business of the courts (Conf. Rept.,
      Sept. 1960, p. 27).
         (c) H.R. 2733, 87th Congress, would amend the provisions
      of Title 9 of the United States Code, relating to arbitration,
      so as to provide for judicial review of questions of law arising
      in arbitration proceedings. This bill is similar to H.R. 6322,
                                23 

      86th Congress, which, to the extent that it would authorize
      the judicial review of interlocutory questions of law arising
      in the course of arbitration proceedings, was disapproved by
      the Conference at its September 1959 session (Con!. Rept.,
      p.36).
         (d) H.R. 3968, 87th Congress, providing for the enforce­
      ment of support orders in certain state and federal courts,
      would also make it a crime to travel in interstate or foreign
      commerce to avoid compliance with such orders. This bill is
      similar to S. 353 and H.R. 495, 86th Congress. The Con­
      ference, at its March 1959 session (Conf. Rept., p. 30) disap­
      proved the provisions of those bills which would provide for
      the registration and enforcement of support orders by federal
      district courts and expressed no opinion on the other features
      of the bills. The Conference renewed its action with respect
      to this proposal.
         (e) H.R. 4241 would provide an administrative hearing
      prior to, and a judicial review after, the administrative re­
      moval or suspension of federal employees of the Executive
      branch. The Conference at its September 1959 session disap­
      proved as inappropriate a proposal for judicial review of this
      sort of administrative personnel .action (Con!. Rept., p. 13).
      The Conference renewed its dtsapproval of this feature of
     H.R. 4241, but expressed no opinion as to the administrative
      procedures proposed by the bill.
   6. Judge Maris reported that the Committee had been requested
to consider amending 28 U.S.C. 2253 so as to limit the time within
which an application may be made for the certificate of probable
cause required by that Section in connection with an appeal from
a final order in a habeas corpus proceeding, where the detention
complained of arises out of process issued by a state court. It haa
also been suggested that the certificate of probable cause required
by Section 2253 no longer serves a useful purpose and should be
abolished. The Conference, upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee, referred these proposals to the Committee on Habeas
Corpus.
   7. The Conference waa informed that the Committee had con­
sidered the possibility of amending 28 U.S.C. 1404(a), which au­
thorizes the transfer of civil .actions for the convenience of the
parties and witnesses, in the light of the narrow construction
placed upon the section in Hoffman v. BlaskiJ 363 U.S. 335. The
                                 24 

problem was reviewed in joint session by the Committees on Re­
vision of the Laws and Court Administration. A majority of the
members of these two Committees recommended that the final
clause of 28 U.S.C. 1404(a)-"where it might have been
brought"-be stricken from the statute so as to permit the trans­
fer of an action to any other district or division for the convenience
of the parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.
    The Conference, after a full discussion, directed that the pro­
posal be referred again to the Committees for further considera­
tion in the light of the discussions in the Conference.
   S. The Committee, upon request, also studied the statute au­
thorizing the removal of actions from state courts. It had been
pointed out that in certain states a civil action may be brought
in any county in the state, subject to the right of the defendant
to have the case transferred to the county of proper venue. Since,
under the present removal statute, a petition for removal must be
filed within 20 days after the filing of the first pleading, the de­
fendant in such a case is put to an election whether to move for
a change of venue, in which case he must remain in the state court,
or to file a petition for removal, in which case he may find him­
self in an inconvenient federal court. The Committee recom­              ()
mended that 28 U.S.C. 1446 be amended to permit the defendant
in a suit in a state court to file his petition for removal within 20
days after the state court has decided his motion for a change of
venue, provided such motion was filed within the period of 20 days
after service of the first pleading, the time now fixed by law for
filing a petition for removal.
   The Conference approved this recommendation.
   9. The attention of the Committee had been called to the prob­
lem involved in the efficient disposition of multiple litigation
which has frequently resulted from major catastrophies, such as
airplane and rail accidents, resulting in the death or injury of
many individuals at the same time and involving the same ele­
ments of potential liability. The Committee considered this a
serious and important problem, and referred it to a subcommittee
on venue for study and subsequent report.

        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
  The Chairman of the standing Committee on Rules of Practice
and Procedure, Senior Circuit Judge Albert B. Maris, presented           ()
                                 25 

the Conference with a progress report on the work and activities
of the standing Committee and the Advisory COmmittees on
Rules of Practice and Procedure.
   The Conference was informed that, since its meeting in Septem­
ber, preliminary drafts of proposed rules and amendments were
submitted to the standing COmmittee by four of the Advisory
Committees-Civil, Admiralty, Bankruptcy and Appellate-and
that these had been widely circulated in printed form to the bench,
bar, and law schools thl'oughout the United States. Comments
and criticisms were solicited and these, when received, were
promptly transmitted to the appropriate Advisory Committee for
study. Following full consideration of the communications thus
received, three of the Advisory Committees, those for civil, ad­
miralty and bankruptcy rules, approved definitive drafts of pro­
posed amendments and reported them to the standing Committee
for consideration and action. The standing Committee carefully
considered each of these drafts, made certain technical suggestions
for improvement, and approved the drafts and directed that they
be submitted to the Judicial Conference.
              ADVISORY CoMMITTEE ON CIVIL RULES

    The Advisory Committee on Civil Rules has underway a form­
 idable program, the significance and the potentialities of which
 would be difficult to overstate in the efforts to improve the ad­
 ministration of justice.
    The Committee has oompleted a preliminary examination of the
 1955 proposed amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure which
 were made by the former Advisory Committee, and which the
 Supreme Court did not, a,t the time, deem it advisable to transmit
 to the Congress. The Reporter's comprehensive report to the Ad­
visory COmmittee upon the 1955 proposed amendments was con­
sidered at the first meeting of the Committee on December 5-7,
1960, and conclusions were reached upon certain of the proposals,
subject to further consideration, research and drafting, which is
going forward.
   The Advisory Committee recommended the prompt a:rnendment
of certain Rules of Civil Procedure [Rules 25,54, and 86 and Forms
2 and 19] which are causing confusion and difficulty. The pro­
posed amendments provide (1) for the automatic substitution as
a; party of the su'Ccessor when a public officer who sues or is sued
                                26 

in his official capacity dies, resigns or otherwise ceases to hold
office, (2) for authority to enter a final appealable judgment as      1
to one or more but fewer than all of the parties in a multiple­
parties suit, and (3) for the inclusion in Forms 2 and 19 of aver­
ments consistent with present statutory requirements.
   The standing Committee approved these amendments, but the
Conference was advised that a communication addressed to the
Committee from the Attorney General, dated March 13, had just
been received suggesting possible changes in the language with
respect to the amendment of Rule 25(d).
   The Conference directed that the Committee on Rules of Prac­
tice and Procedure confer with the Attorney General, or his desig­
nated representative, regarding the proposed amendment to Rule
25(d) and authorized the Committee, at the conclusion of such
conference, to submit the amendment without a change in lan­
guage, or in revised form, or to withdraw it entirely if it is con­
cluded that further consideration is advisable.
   Upon this understanding, the Conference voted to approve
the proposed amendments to Rules 25(d) and 54(b) of the Fed­
eral Rules of Civil Procedure and Forms 2 and 19 and directed
that they be transmitted to the Supreme Court of the United
States with the recommendation that the amendments be promul­
gated.
   The Advisory Committee on Civil Rules has approved a program
of future work which includes, in addition to research, further
study and consideration of certain of the proposals made in 1955
by the former Advisory Committee, (a) a general study of the
subject of parties (Rules 17-25) which has been initiated, and
 (b) a general study of Discovery (Rules 26-37) with related study
of the Pre-trial Conference (Rule 16), a plan of which has been
outlined comprising both analytic work by the Reporter and his
associates and field investigation by the Project for Effective
Justice at Columbia University Law School to be financed by a
foundation. It is contemplated that the analytic work will start
about July 1, 1961, and that the work of devising a pattern of field
investigation will start about September 1, 1961.
         ADVISORY CoMMITl'EE ON ADMIRALTY          RULm
  The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules has devoted its
study to (1) matters of an emergency nature resulting from the
                                        27 


       decision in ll1iner v. Atlass, 363 U.S. 641, and (2) long-range plan­
       ning of the program of the committee.
          The Supreme Court of the United States handed down its opin­
       ion in the Miner case on June 20, 1960, and referred to the Ad­
       miralty Committee, by name, a major problem in admiralty rule­
       making.
          Briefly stated, prior to the Miner case, several districts., in
      which more than half the private admiralty suits are filed, had
       adopted local rules specifically making the Federal Rules of Civil
      Procedure applicable to the taking of depositions of parties and
      witnesses. Other districts had local rules making the civil rules
      applicable to matters not otherwise covered. And in certain other
      districts, for one reason or another, the practice with respect to
      depositions was broader than was authorized by the existing ad­
      miralty rules.
         The Supreme Court decided as a matter of law that discovery­
      depositions procedures were not authorized by the General Admi­
      ralty Rules, that local district courts did not possess the authority
      to promulgate and establish discovery-deposition rules in admi­
      ralty cases and, finally, that such basic changes in admiralty prac­
(	    tice could be made only in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 2073 which
      requires promulgation of proposed rules by the Supreme Court
      and reporting to Congress.
         The most evident consequences of the decision are that, as in the
      Atlass case itself, lawyers generally are prevented from taking dis­
      covery depositions which they would like to take; and depositions
      already taken, while they may have served a useful purpose,
      cannot now be used in evidence.
         The results in many districts were quite serious because of the
      many depositions already taken, involving hundreds of thousands
      of dollars.
         The Supreme Court was mindful that its decision would cause
     some dislocation in practice in the districts where such rules had
     been in force, and expressed the hope that the Advisory Committee
     on Admiralty Rules would give the matter its early attention.
         Pursuant to this directive and at the request of the standing
     Committee, the Admiralty Committee promptly acted and sought
     by letter the experience and advice of approximately 90 United
     States district judges and 1,000 admiralty lawyers in those districts

c    having local discovery rules in admiralty. The responses, which
          595097-61--5
                                  28 

 ·were full and representative, indicated overwhelming approval of
 the deposition practice, and included valuable technical suggestions
 for drafting purposes.
   As a result, the Admiralty Committee drafted proposed new and
 amended Rules of Practice and Procedure in Admiralty and Mari­
time Cases. The amendments would (1) authorize depositions
and discovery in admiralty practice substantially in accordance
with the Civil Rules, (2) authorize the use of depositions taken
 prior to July 20, 1960, in reliance on local rules or practices, as well
 as all deposi tions taken by consent of the parties, to the same
extent as if they had been authorized by valid rules, (3) authorize
summary judgments in admiralty and (4) authorize declaratory
 judgments in admiralty.
   The draft was submitted to the standing Committee and widely
distributed to the bench, bar, and the law schools. Comments and
suggestions were received in due time and were carefully examined
by the Admiralty Committee. They were overwhelmingly favor­
able and required no changes in the amendments as drafted, but
certain clarifying changes were made in the notes accompanying
 the proposed amendments.
   The standing Committee has approved the proposed amend- (
ments.
   The Conference, after full consideration of the definitive draft
of the proposed amendments to the rules of practice in admiralty
and maritime cases and accompanying notes, approved the draft
and directed that it be transmitted to the Supreme Court with the
recommendation that the amendments be promulgated.
   The future program of the Admiralty Committee includes ex­
tensive research and consideration of the advisability and feasi­
bility of unifying the practice in civil and admiralty cases under
a single set of rules of procedure which would, of course, include
all special provisions required in admiralty. This is, of course, an
undertaking of great importance to the bench and bar.
          ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON BANKRUPTcY RULES

  The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules, in addition to
embarking on a comprehensive program aimed at improving the
 General Orders and Official Forms in Bankruptcy, has made a
thorough-going study of the statutes enat.:ted since 1952, and has
developed a preliminary draft containing proposed revisions of         (j
                                           29 

           certain General Orders and Official Forms in Bankruptcy. The
           proposed amendments would (1) bring the General Orders and
           Official Forms into harmony with recent amendments of the
           Bankruptcy Act, (2) bring them into harmony with current and
           sound practice and (3) correct obvious departures from approved
           form.
              The preliminary draft was transmitted to the standing Commit­
           tee, printed and submitted to the bench, bar, and law schools for
           consideration and suggestions. As a result, the draft was revised
           in certain particulars and forwarded by the Advisory Committee.
 .1          The standing Committee has approved the proposed amend­
          ments.
             The Conference, after full consideration of the proposed amend­
          ments to the General Orders and Official Forms in Bankruptcy,
          approved the draft and directed that it be transmitted to the
          Supreme Court with the recommendation that the amendments
          be promulgated.
             The attention of the Conference was called to the fact that
          Section 30 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 53, aut.horizing the
          Supreme Court to prescribe rules, forms and orders in Bankruptcy,
      (   does not require that the Court report them to Congress, as is
          required in regard to the rules of civil and admiralty procedure.
          The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules, after considera­
          tion, concluded that rule making in Bankruptcy should conform
          to the pattern prescribed in rule making in the areas of civil and
          admiralty procedure and, therefore, recommended the enactment
          of legislation substantially as follows:
                   The Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe, by
                general rules, the forms of process, writs, pleadings, and mo­
                tions and the practice and procedure under the Bankruptcy
                Act.
                   Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any sub­
               stantive right.
""                 Such rules shall not take effect until they have been re­
               ported to Congress by the Chief Justice at or after the begin­
               ning of a regular session thereof but not later than the first
               day of May and until the expiration of ninety days after they
               have been thus reported.
                   All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further
               force or effect after such rules have taken effect.
                                  30 


    The Conference, upon the favorable recommendation of the
 standing Committee, approved the proposal and directed that ap­
 propriate legislation be initiated in the Congress.
            ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL RULES

   The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules has undertaken a
rule-by-rule study of all the Criminal Rules, and proposed amend­
menta will not be forwarded until the entire study has been com­
pleted, unless a situation otherwise requires. As a consequence,
it is not expected that the Judicial Conference will receive any rec­
ommendations developed by the Advisory Committee until such
time as a tentative draft covering all the Rules has been prepared.
   The Advisory Committee has under discussion currently Rules
1-9,44,18-22,10-17, and 23-31.

           ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON ApPELLATE RULES

    The Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules, upon its appoint­
 ment, was presented with the immediate task of drafting a pro­
 posed rule for the review of decisions of the Tax Court of the
 United States. Congress had placed responsibility for promul­
 gation of such a rule upon the Supreme Court in 1954, 28 U.S.C.
 2074, but the existing personnel and facilities of the Supreme Court
 are in no sense adequate to perform this type of rulemaking func­
 tion. Moreover, with the ever-increasing length of the calendars,
 it is obviously not feasible for the Justices themselves to do the
 work essential to the original drafting of new or amended rules of
 procedure. Thus, the task was assigned to the standing Com­
 mittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and referred as a first
order of business to the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules.
   The Advisory Committee prepared a preliminary draft of a
proposed rule for the review of decisions of the Tax Court which
was printed and widely circulated in November 1960.
   Many suggestions and comments were received and these were
considered by the Advisory Committee. It was decided to give
the preliminary draft further study in the light of the communica­
tions received and to report upon it to the standing Committee at
a later date.
   The Advisory Committee is developing a comprehensive pro­
gram for improving appellate procedure in the United States
courts, including a broad examination of the appellate rules to
                                      31 

     determine how well they are working, to pinpoint the specific prob­
     lems, and to identify those areas in which there is little or no dif­
     ficulty. In addition to rilles relating to the appeal of civil and
     criminal cases, there are the rules governing the appeal of admiralty
     and maritime cases, bankruptcy cases, the review of orders of
     administrative agencies, the unique-and urgent-problems in
     appeals in forma pauperis, and many other technical matters which
     will be given attention.

              ADVISORY CoMMITI'EE ON         RULES   OF EVIDENCE

        The Judicial Conference at its 1958 session (Conf. Rept.,
     p. 15) referred to the Committee on Rules of Practice and Pro­
     cedure a proposal to establish uniform rules of evidence for the
     federal courts.
       At ita meeting in December 1960 the Advisory Committee on
     Civil Rilles adopted the following resolution:
          That the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules urge the standing
          Committee to initiate a project, at a time thought suitable
          by the standing Committee and whether through an existing
          committee or a new group, to study the feasibility of adopting
          uniform rules of evidence for the Federal courts and, if found
          feasible, to draft such rules.
       The proposal urging the promillgation of federal rilles of evi­
     dence has broad support in the bench and bar. It also has the
     support of the American Bar Association, the American Law
     Institute, the Federal Bar Association, the National Conference of
     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and the Judicial Confer­
     ences of several circuita.
       The standing Committee reported that it recommends the
     establishment of an Advisory Committee to study evidence. The
     Conference is of the view that the proposal looking forward to the
     promulgation of Federal Rules of Evidence is meritorious, that it
     deserves serious study as to ita advisability and feasibility and
     that, if resolved in favor of such rules, that uniform rules of evi­
     dence for the federal courts should in due course be promulgated.
     For these reasons, the Conference approved the recommendation
     of the standing Committee, authooized the creation of an Advisory
     Committee on Rules of Evidence, and amended paragraph (2) of
     the resolution adopted at the September 1958 session (Conf. Rept.,
l_   p.6) accordingly.

                        SALARIES AND POSITIONS OF REFEREES

   The Conference was informed by the Chairman of the Com­
mittee on Bankruptcy Administration, Senior Judge Orie L. Phil­
lips, that the Committee met and considered the recommendations
contained in the Report of the Director of the Administrative
Office, dated December 23, 1960, relating to the continuance of
referee positions to become vacant prior to October 1, 1961, by
expiration of term, for changes in salaries of referees, changes in
arrangements, and the creating of new referee positions. The
Committee also considered the recommendations of the district
judges and the judicial councils of the circuits concerned.
   The Conference considered fully the Committee's report and
the recommendations of the Director, the Judicial Councils and
the district judges. On the basis of the report and recommenda­
tions, the Conference took the action shown in the following table
relating to changes in salaries and the creation of new referee
positions, and directed that, unless otherwise shown, this action
become effective on JUly 1, 1961, or as soon thereafter as appropri­
ated funds are available:                                                                                          (

                 PENDING AND PRoPOSED LEGISLATION

Dischargeability oj Debts
   R.R. 1742, 87th Congress would amend Section2a of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. Il(a), by adding at the end thereof a new
clause which would give to the Bankruptcy colirt jurisdiction to
determine the dischargeability or non-dischargeability of provable                     (
debts. The bill embodies a proposal which was approved by the                           "
Conference at its September 1960 session (Conf. Rept., p. 23), and
the Conference reaffirmed its approval.
Referees' Retirement and Salary Bill
   The Conference had previously approved in principle proposals
for increasing the salaries of and improving retirement provisions
for, referees in bankruptcy. The draft of such a bill had been
considered and approved by the Committee, and transmitted by
the Administrative Office through the regular channels for intro­
duction in the 87th Congress. The Conference approved the bill
(R.R. 5341).
   Briefly, the bill would amend the Bankruptcy Act to provide:
     1. Terms of 12 years for full-time referees.
     2. 	Maximum salary limitation of $17,500 for a full-:-:time
           referee and $8,500 fora part-time referee, with an in­
           crease for the Chief, Bankruptcy Division of the Admin­
           istrative Office.
     3. Compensation for service of a retired referee.
     4. 	A more liberal retirement annuity, and mandatory retire-                      f
           ment at age 75, for referees.                                               (~

                          ApPROPRIATIONS

Fiscal Years 1961 and 1962
    The Administrative Office had previously reported that a sup­
 plemental appropriation of $504,000 had been requested for the
 fiscal year 1961, and that regular appropriations totaling $6,920,000
 had been requested for the fiscal year 1962. These estimates
 were based on an anticipated volume of 130,000 new bankruptcy
·cases in 1962. The Director believes that the payments into the
 Referees' Salary and Expense Fund will be ample to provide these
.amounts.
Expenses of the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office
   The attention of the Conference was called to a proposal origi­
nating in the House Appropriations Committee that the cost of
the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts, including the bankruptcy statistical section,
be paid from the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund.
   The Conference was of the view that, if the House Appropria­
tions Committee desired the change as a matter of legislative
policy, it should be accomplished and the Conference voted to
approve the proposal.
              RECEIVERS, TRUSTEES AND ApPRAISERS

Appointment of Receivers and Trustees and Audit of Statistical
   Reports
   The Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office has con­
tinued, during the last six months, its examination of statistical
reports in order to discover the existence of any monopoly situa­
tions in the appointment of receivers and trustees. Considerable
progress has been made in eliminating these situations and the
payment of exorbitant compensation to receivers and trustees.
   The statistical report on closed cases, Form J.S. 19, and instruc­
tions with respect to it, were revised effective July 1, 1960, so as
to eliminate statistical data no longer used, to conform the reports
to the consolidation of the Salary and Expense Fund, to provide
the names of the attorneys serving in each case, and to provide for
the separation of net proceeds realized from gross disbursements
where businesses are operated by receivers and trustees. Many
referees have expressed their full approval of these changes, which
have resulted in a reduction of errors in reporting statistical data.

Accountability of Referees, Receivers and Trustees                             !
   The Bankruptcy Division is also continuing its examination of
statistical reports to discover any errors in the computation of the
compensation of receivers and trustees, and charges for the Ref­
erees' Salary and Expense Fund, and the number of errors has
been greatly reduced in recent months. The Committee requested
the Bankruptcy Division to proceed with its examination of sta­
                                                                              II
tistical reports, and submit its findings and recommendations to a            .1
subcommittee consisting of Circuit Judge Hamlin, Chairman, Cir­                !

cuit Judge Aldrich and District Judge Albert V. Bryan, on the
question of the accountability of receivers, trustees and referees
with respect to such errors. The subcommittee will report to the
full Committee at a later date.
Audit of the Accounts of Trustees in Chapter XIII Cases
  The Bankruptcy Division had suggested to the Committee the
desirability of periodic audits of the .accounts of trustees in Chap­
ter XIII cases, to be paid for out of the trustee's allowance for the
expense of operating his office. It was the view of the Committee
that such periodic audits are essential and should be made.
Appointment of Court Personnel as Appraisers in Bankruptcy (I
 Proceedings                                                .
   There had been referred to the Bankruptcy Committee by the
Director of the Administrative Office the question as to whether
the appointment of court personnel to serve as appraisers in bank­
ruptcy cases is proper and appropriate in the administration of
the Bankruptcy Act. The Committee concluded, after full con­
sideration, that this practice cannot be justified. Accordingly, the
Committee recommended that such practice be prohibited.
   The Conference disapproved the practice as improper and detri­
mental to the proper administration of justice in bankruptcy
cases.
   The Committee reported that it had concluded that the prac­
tice of appointing court personnel as appraisers in bankruptcy
should be prohibited by an amendment to the General Orders
rather than by new legislation and voted to so recommend to the
Conference. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
   The Conference referred the foll<rlving draft of a proposed
amendment to General Order 45, submitted by the Committee, to           «
                                                                        "'­

    ita consideration:
            "No auctioneer, accountant, or appraiser shall be appointed
         or employed by the court, receiver, trustee, or debtor in p0s.­
         session except upon an order of the court expressly fixing the
         amount of the compensation or the rate or measure thereof.
         No person who is an employee of the Judicial Branch or the
         Department of Justice shall be eligible for appointment or
         employment as an auctioneer, accountant or appraiser."
    Reference of Coopter X (Corporate Reorganization) Cases and
       Coopter XII (Real Estate Arrangement) Cases by the Clerk of
       the Court
       The Conference was advised that the subcommittee appointed
    to consider the proposal to amend the Bankruptcy Act so as to pro­
    vide for the reference by the clerk of Chapter X (Corporate reor­
    ganization) and Chapter XII (Real estate alTangement) cases to
    referees in bankruptcy had not completed its study. Accordingly,
    consideration of the proposal has been defelTed until the next
    meeting of the Bankruptcy Committee.
(   Matters Referred to the Bankruptcy Committee by the Advisory
       Committee on Bankruptcy Rules
       (1) Pauper Petitions in Bankruptcy.-Although Section 51(2)
    of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 sanctioned the filing of voluntary
    petitions without the payment of any fee, when aeoompanied by
    a pauper's affidavit, General Order 35(4), promulgated by the
    Supreme Court in 1899, authorized the judge, after notice and hear­
    ing, to order payment in full within a specified time on penalty of
    dismissal. This General Order was strictly enforced. Both pro­
    visions, however, were deleted by the Salary Act of 1946 and the
    Supreme Court was authorized to permit, by General Order, the
    payment of filing fees, in voluntary straight bankruptcy cases and
    in Chapter XIII (Wage Earner) cases, in installments. However,
    there has remained in Section 48c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11
    U.S.C. 76(c), with respect to the payment of the trustee's fee, the
    phrase "when a fee is not required from a voluntary bankrupt."
       The Committee recommended that the phrase "where install­
    ment payments may be a.uthorized pursuant to Section 40 of this
    Act" be substituted so that the sub-section would read in. part as
    follows:
                                 44 

        "c. Trustees. The compensation of trustees for their serv-·
     ices, payable after they are rendered, shall be a fee of $10.00. (
     for each estate, deposited with the clerk at the time the petition
     is filed in each case, except where installment payments may
     be authorized pursuant to Section 40 of this Act, and such
     further sum as the Court may allow, .as follows: ..."
This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
   (2) Appointment of Trustees.-The Advisory Committee on
Bankruptcy Rules pointed out to the Committee an apparent in­
consistency between Section 44a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.
72(a), which seems to require the appointment of a trustee in
every case, and General Order 15, which authorizes the Court to
dispense with the appointment of a trustee in no-asset cases. The
Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office will compile
statistical data with respect to this problem and present it for
study to both the Bankruptcy Committee and to the Advisory
Committee on Bankruptcy Rules.
                    MISCELLANEOUS MATl'ERS

Fees and Special Charges
  Several referees have suggested to the Bankruptcy Committee (
that a special charge should be made for an amendment to a bank­
ruptcy schedule, in order to compensate, to some extent, for the
added clerical work in the offices of the referees and to discourage
unnecessary amendment of such schedules. It was the view of
the Committee that the suggestion has merit and, accordingly, the
Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office has been directed
to study the proposal and draft a regUlation to be added to the
schedule of special charges under Section 40c of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U.S.C, 68(c),
Certification of Dot:Uments
  The Committee reported that recommendations have been re­
ceived from time to time from referees' offices that someone in
addition to the referee and clerk of the district court be authorized
to certify documents under the provisions of Section 21d of the
Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 44(d). At present, the documents. in
bankruptcy cases are admissible as evidence only when certified by
the referee or the clerk of the district court. The Committee rec­
ommended that the Conference approve the drafting of an amend- rr
ment to Section 21d to provide in substance that documents may \\....
                                 45 

be certified by the referee or by an employee designated by him.
The Administrative Office would be directed to draft the bill ini­
tially. This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
Deposit of Bankruptcy Funds
 It had been suggested from time to time that the funds of bank­
rupt estates be deposited in interest-bearing accounts, such as time
deposit accounts, savings accounts and the like, so that some incre­
ment will accrue to these estates. In many cases, large sums of
money are held by trustees for long periods of time pending the
settlement of litigation, and it has been felt that, with proper
security, such funds might be deposited at interest. The Com­
mittee, accordingly, requested the Bankruptcy Division of the
Administrative Office to study the proposal and to draft for the
consideration of the Committee an amendment to the Bankruptcy
Act which will permit the deposit of funds of bankrupt estates at
interest with proper security.
                JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
   The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief Judge
William J. Campbell, reported that the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office and members of the Committee had appeared be­
fore the Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations of the
House of Representatives in support of the budget estimates for
the courts for the fiscal year 1962 and that a full presentation of
the needs of the courts was made.
   The Conference was advised that during the course of the hear­
ings particular reference was made to travel costs of judges serv­
ing on assignment; personnel accompanying judges on assignment;
the changes in the volume of court business during the last year;
the distribution of questionnaires and other material to judges; the
acquisition of furniture; jury costs; and the use of land commis­
sioners. The Subcommittee on Appropriations was supplied with
full information with respect to each of these items, and was ad­
vised that a special study of the use of land commissioners is cur­
rently being made by a Committee of the Conference.
                            JURY CoSTS

 The Committee reported that the funds available for the pay­
ment of jury fees during the current fiscal year are 41;2 percent less
                                              46 


than the actual expenditures during 1960. Expenditures through ­
January and February 1961 have exceeded budgeted amounts and, ;{
if it is possible for the district courts to stay within the appropri­
ations, further economies must be made in the operation of the
jury system during the remaining months of this fiscal year.

                        OMNIBUS JUDGESHIP LEGISLATION

  The Subcommittee on Appropriations was informed that the
cost during the first year of the 73 judgeships contained in the
omnibus judgeship bill, S. 912, 87th Congress, as passed by the
Senate, was estimated at $6,400,000, not including the cost of space
for the new judges and members of their staffs. This is based on
a unit cost during the first year of $72,600 for a circuit judgeship
.and $90,000 for a district judgeship. Because of the non-recurring
initial costs of a library and equipment, the unit cost per judge­
ship decreases in succeeding years to $50,800 for a circuit judge
 and $65,700 for a district judge, not including the costs of
accommodations.'!.
                                      TRAVEL CoSTS

   Chief Judge Campbell informed the Conference that travel costs ((
have increased, necessitating a request for an incre.ase in travel
funds for the fiscal year 1962. The Conference resolved that if the
requested increase in travel funds is not granted, seminars, in­
stitutes on sentencing and similar meetings should be deferred
until such time during the fiscal year 1962 as it can be ascertained
that they can be conducted without hampering other official travel.
   The Conference further resolved that plans for seminars, in­
stitutes on sentencing and similar meetings should be submitted to
the Judicial Conference in sufficient detail to allow for a reasonably
accurate budget estimate and, wherever practical, in sufficient time
for inolusion by the Conference in the budget estimates.

           ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law, Chief Judge William F. Smith, presented to the
Conference the proposal for a regional Sentencing Institute for
the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Circuits to be held October 12-13,
  :<   See Apppendtt I for an itemized statement of tbe estimated eosta Involved In ereatlng .   t(.

    1961, at Highland Park, Illinois. The Conference was advised
    that the program submitted was in accordance with the require­
    ments of the statute, 28 U.S.C. 334, and the Committee recom­
    mended that the program be approved and the holding of the
    Sentencing Institute be authorized.
      The Conference authorized the convening of the Institute, in
    accordance with the plan and program presented, subject to the
    availability of funds at the time for travel and other expenses.
      The Conference was also informed of the publication in a
    separate volume, by West Publishing Company, of the proceedings
    of the Pilot Institute on Sentencing, held July 16-17, 1959, at the
    University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado.
      The proceedings were originally published in 26 Federal Rules
    Decisions 231.
                      SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
        The Conference referred to the Committee on Supporting Per­
      sonnel the consideration of the comprehensive survey of court
      personnel now in process by the Administrative Office. The
      project had previously been referred to both the Committees on
   ': Supporting Personnel and Court Administration.

                        PRETRIAL PROGRAM
      The Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure, Chief
    Judge Alfred P. Murrah, reported that plans had been prepared
    for a seminar in accordance with the resolution approved by the
    Conference at its September 1960 session (Conf. Rept., p. 37).
    The purpose of the seminar is to explore and develop the most
    effective techniques for the utilization of the pretrial and trial
    procedures contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    The seminar will be held under the auspices of the Southwestern
    Legal Foundation and has been scheduled for July 10, 11 and 12 at
    Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. It is anticipated
    that the newly appointed district judges will be invited to
    participate.
           INTER-CIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
       The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Inter-Circuit
 , Assignments, Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported upon the proc­
( J' essing of requests for inter-circuit assignments.
                                       48
   The Judicial Conference at its meeting on March 11, 1960, had _
adopted a policy statement and plan for future processing of inter-a
circuit assignments of United States judges. The first objective
was to encourage, as far as possible, judges having comparatively
light workloads to accept inter-circuit assignments for service on
courts that are hard pressed. The second objective was to make
sure that inter-circuit assignments would be authorized only
where they would benefit the judicial system as a whole and never
when they were merely for the benefit or convenience of the judges
concerned.2
   The Committee, in accordance with sub-division III(9) of the
Plan for the Assignment of Judges, prepared and distributed to all
members of the Conference a statement relating to the needs for
out-of-circuit assistance and to the availability of judges for such
services. Twenty-six inter-circuit assignments have been favor­
ably recommended since the last report to the Conference. No
adverse recommendation has been made. One offer of assistance
was withdrawn after favorable Committee action and designation
by the Chief Justice.
   The Conference was informed that the unavailability of judicial
assistance for districts in need is a matter of much concern, but((
it is anticipated that solution of the existing problems will become
less difficult in the event Congress authorizes the additional judge­
ships. However, because of inevitable fluctuations in judicial
business and emergency situations, the increase in available
judgepower cannot eliminate entirely the need for inter-circuit
assignments.
   The details of all inter-circuit assignments authorized from
March 11, 1960, to February 17, 1961, are provided in Appendix
II. During this entire period there has been no inter-circuit
assignment that has not been fully reviewed and approved by the
Advisory Committee of Judges before being authorized.
             OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury
System, Chief Judge Harry E. Watkins, informed the Conference
that the report, The Jury System in the Federal Courts, approved
by the Conference at its September 1960 session, is being published
 I See Appendix II for a summary of reqnests and the aetlon taken by the Advlsorr ('­
Committee.                                                                        (

         by the West Publishing Company in Federal Rules Decisions.
     I   Individual copies are being forwarded to each judge, to the At­
         torney General and other officials in the Department, and to mem­
         bers of the Committees on the Judiciary of the Congress.
            The report, based on extensive research over a period of three
         years, contains a detailed statement of the methods of jury selec­
         tion in the United States district courts and recommends pro­
         cedures for the selection of qualified jurors with economical ad­
         ministration of the system.
            The Committee reported that the following legislation spon­
         sored by the Judicial Conference to improve the jury system had
         been transmitted to the Congress:
             To increase the subsistence aRd limit mileage allowances of
                 grand and petit jurors. (H.R. 5616)
              To increase the fees of jury commmissioners in the U.S. district
                 courts. (H.R.5392)
              To provide for a jury commission for each U.S. district court.
                 (H.R.5391)
            The following bills containing proposals previously disapproved
         by the Conference were again disapproved:
 ,               H.R. 818 and H.R. 1262-would provide that in a civil case
              the number of jurors required to constitute a jury, and the
              number of whom must agree for a valid verdict, shall be
              determined by the law of the State in which the action is
              tried.
                 H.R. 189-which would require a juror to take an oath that
              he does not advocate and is not a member of an organization
              that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the
              United States by force or violence.
                                HABEAS CORPUS
           The Chairman of- the Special Committee on Habeas Corpus,
         Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, stated that the legislation previ­
         ously approved by the Conference to amend Sections 2244, 2253,
         and 2254 of title 28, United States Code, relating to applications
         for writs of habeas corpus by persons in custody pursuant to the
         judgment of a State court, had been introduced in the Congress.
           The Conference, after discussion, reaffirmed its approval of the
         legislation and, in so doing, authorized the Director to transmit
);       to the Congress two clarifying amendments and one substantive
         amendment.
                           50 

    First, it is suggested that the bill amend "chapter 153" in
lieu of section 2254 specifically. This is purely a technical r~(·
amendment.
    Second, it is suggested that in Section 1, subsection (b),
the words "after a hearing" be inserted between the words
"denied by" on the second line. This is technical and clar­
ifying only.
    Third, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254, provides that an application
for habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant
to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted by a
federal court unless the applicant "has exhausted the reme­
dies available in the courts of the state." In Darr v. Burford,.
339 U.S. 200 the Supreme Court held that "the remedies
available in the courts of the state" included a petition for
certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. While
that case involved a failure to seek a writ of certiorari from
a decision of a state court denying post conviction relief, it
has been read by some prisoners as suggesting that they must
also file petitions for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the
United States from the affirmance of their convictions by a
state supreme court. This is true even through the record
in these state court proceedings is such that the Supreme
Court of the United States cannot review the alleged federal
questions, and even though the prisoner is aware of this fact
and does not wish to seek review of the state court judgment.
Dozens of petitions for certiorari are filed in the Supreme
Court of the United States each term in which the petitioner
asserts that he is aware that certiorari will be denied and is
filing his petition only because he is required to do so by Darr
v. Burford. The result of this purely formal procedure is to
waste a year's time or more in disposing of the alleged federal
questions, and to require the courts to go through a whole
series of useless steps in processing appeals that are admittedly
purely formal. There appears to be universal agreement that
it would be desirable for Congress to correct the language of
28 U.S.C. 2254 so as to eliminate this useless and time con­
suming procedure. It is suggested that this be accomplished
by adding to Section 3 of the bill a subsection (d) providing
that {(remedies available in the courts of the state" do not
include review by the Supreme Court of the United States.

                 THE USE OF LAND COMMISSIONERS
\.
         Chief Judge Royce H. Savage, on behalf of Judge Stanley N.
     l3arnes, Chairman of the Committee on the Use of Land Commis­
     sioners, infonned the Conference that a Committee report had been
     prepared, but that several items in the report had not been agreed
     upon among the Committee members. The Conference discussed
     .at some length the various problems that have arisen in regard
     to the use of land commissioners including the statements made at
     hearings before the appropriations Committees that the authority
     to appoint land commissioners had been abused in some districts
     .and that exorbitant compensation to the commissioners had been
      allowed. The Committee was granted leave to consider these
     problems further and to report to the Conference thereon as soon
     as possible.
            RESPONSIBILITIES AND POWERS OF THE 

                     JUDICIAL COUNCILS 

        The Chairman of the Special Committee on the Responsibili­
     ties .and Powers of the Judicial Councils of the Circuits, Chief
     Judge Johnsen, presented the Conference with a comprehensive
     report.
        The views and conclusions of the Committee, which reviewed the
     background and legislative history of the statute creating the
     judicial councils and considered the various expressions of views in
     the legal literature, are as follows:
             (1) Under 28 U.S.c. 332, the Judicial Councils are intended
          to have, .and have, the responsibility of attempting to see that
          the business of each of the courts within the circuit is effec­
          tivelyand expeditiously administered.
             (2) The responsibility of the Councils "for the effective and
          expeditious administration of the business of the courts within
          its circuit" extends not merely to the business of the courts
          in its technical sense (Judicial administration), such as the
          handling and dispatching of cases, but also to the business
          of the judiciary in its institutional sense (administration of
          justice), such as the avoiding of any stigma, disrepute, or
          other element of loss of public esteem and confidence in re­
          spect to the court system, from the actions of a judge or other
          person attached to the courts.


                                                                             I
                          52
   (3) The Councils have the responsibility and owe the duty
of taking such action as may be necessary, inoluding the is- «~
suance of "all necessary orders", to attempt to accomplish
these ends.
   (4) These responsibilities should ordinarily be approached,
in the spirit and tradition of the judicial institution, in an
attitude of attempted cooperation and assistance to the dis­
trict courts and not of purported policemanship, since the
purpose of the statute is to make the Council an instrument to     .
                                                                   <

help prevent problems from arising, to help find solutions for
those which have arisen, as well as to take such corrective ac­
tion for prevention or solution "as may be necessary".
   (5) If the Councils are effectively to serve these purposes,
it is manifest that they must undertake to keep themselves
informed. Their primary source of information will, of course,
be the reports of the Director of the Administrative Office, as
referred to in the statute. But formal statistics alone will not
always, and perhaps not usually, be sufficient as a basis for
the exercise of intelligent responsibility. Statistics may point
out the existence of a problem, but they do not ordinarily
demonstrate the causes or reasons underlying the problem.    n
Thus, in the attempt to deal with a problem, such as where a \l
court appears to be falling behind and perhaps to be approach­
ing an incipient congestion, it would seem desirable for the
Council to call upon the Administrative Office to undertake
to make an exploration into the particular situation, in order
to enable it to get at the underlying picture and understand
what it is that needs suggestion or corrective action on the
part of the CounciL
   (6) In the judgment of the Special Committee, the present
statute is adequate to enable the Judicial Councils, on proper
exercise of their responsibilities, to serve their intended pur­
pose, as an instrumentality in the statutory scheme of Public
Law No. 299, for "The Administration of the United States
Courts", to assist in achieving "the effective and expeditious
administration of the business of the courts". The expres­
sion which the Judicial Conference made in the Report of its
September 1939 Session, page 11, after the enactment of the
Act, is entitled to be renewed: "It is confidently expected
that through the operation of this Act the important objec­
                                 53 

      tives to which reference has been made will be measurably
      attained" .
    The Conference discussed the report fully and, after amend­
 ments with respect to the activities of the Councils and the conduct
 of Council meetings, approved the report and authorized its dis­
 tribution to all members of the Federal Judiciary.
 RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS AND
    JUDICIAL CONFERENCES OF THE CIRCUITS
    Chief Judge Biggs presented to the Conference a report on the
 Institute on Sentencing held in conjunction with the Annual Judi­
 cial Conference of the Third Circuit in September 1960. The Con­
 ference received the report and directed that it be filed with the
 records of the Conference.
 PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS OF
   APPEALS OF THE E~GHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS
   At the request of Chief Judge Johnsen, the Conference, pur­
 suant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented that terms of the Court of
 Appeals of the Eighth Circuit at places other than St. Louis be
 pretermitted during the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1961.
   At the request of Chief Judge Murrah, the Conference consented
 that terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit at places
 other than Denver be pretermitted during the fiscal year com­
 mencing July 1, 1961.
      CASES AND MOTIONS UNDER ADVISEMENT
    The Administrative Office submitted to the Conference a report
 on cases under submission in the courts of appeals and cases and
 motions under advisement in the district courts. The report
 listed 39 cases under submission in the courts of appeals more than
 five months as of March 1,1961, and 15 cases and 2 motions which
 had been held under advisement by district judges more than six
 months as of that date. Where necessary, these will be brought
 to the attention of the judicial councils by the chief judges of the
 circuits.
                  INTERLOCUTORY APPEALS
    The Conference was presented a suggestion by Judge Charles E .
. Clark that it reactivate the Committee on Interlocutory Appeals
                                54 

to re-examine the operation of the recent statute authorizing such
appeals on certificate of a district judge, 28 U.S.C. 1292(b). MI;(
Will Shafroth, Deputy Director of the Administrative Office, re­
ported that the opinion among the various circuits, as reflected in
letters from the chief judges of the circuits, was that the statute
was either operating satisfactorily, or that more time was required
to determine its effectiveness. No action was taken by the
Conference.

         JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY FUND
   Mr. Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office,
informed the Conference that the Judicial Survivors Annuity
Fund appeared to be in a satisfactory condition and that an audit
of the fund would be made in accordance with the statute, 28
 U.S.C. 376, when action on the new judgeship bill is completed.

          RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTIONS
   The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
-with respect to legislative and administrative proposals contained
in the reports of the Committees.

  NOTE.-In a location where no quarters are available for the new judge there would be an additlonat
cost of approximately $20,000 per annum tc leaee- space for ageneies displaced. It Is estimated that this
space acquisition cost wouid be involved in establlshing aoout 76% of the new judges. Apart from this;
the GSA would encounter construotlon or altaratlon costs in an undetermined amount.
