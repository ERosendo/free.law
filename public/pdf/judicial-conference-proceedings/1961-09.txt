          REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

   Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, on invitation of the
Chief Justice, spoke to the Conference informally on matters re­
lating to the business of the courts of the United States. He
informed the Conference that the Department had made con­               ( )
siderable progress in selecting judges to be nominated by the
President to fill present judicial vacancies. Of the 118 judge­
ship vacancies occurring during the year, including the 73 new
positions provided in the Omnibus Judgeship Bill, the Depart­
ment expects that 70 to 75 nominations will be sent to the Senate
before the end of the first session of the 87th Congress, and that
thereafter some recess appointments will be made. The selection
of judge!;!. t() fill the remaining positions will be handled expedi­
tiously.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINI,STRATIVE
     OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS

  Warren Olney In;, Director of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts, had previously submitted to the members
of the Conference his report for the fiscal yeai' ending June 30,
1961, in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 604 (a) (3).
The Conference approved the immediate release of the report
                                                                        (
                                         61 

       for publication and authorized the Director to revise and supple­
(      ment the final printed edition to be issued later.

                              STATE OF THE DOCKETS

            Court8 of Appeal8.-Cases filed in the Courts of Appeals during
         the fiscal year 1961 increased for the third consecutive year to a
         record 4,204 cases, an increase of 305 over the previous year. The
         cases disposed of were 4,049, which is 336 more than the number
         disposed of in 1960, but 155 less than the number filed in 1961.
         The pending backlog thus increased to 2,375 cases on June 30,
         1961, an increase of seven per cent over last year.
            The median time interval from the filing of the complete record
         to final disposition for cases terminated after hearing or submis­
         sion in the courts of appeals during 1961 was 6.8 months, the
         same as in the previous year. The median· time interval from
         the docketing of a civil case in the lower court to decision in the
         court of appeals in 1961 was 26.7 months;' for ti criminal case the
         interval was 16.8 months.
           District Court8.'-:"Civil cases filed in the United States District

c'       Courts increased approximately one per cent during 1961, if the
        local cases filed and transferred to the new state court in Alaska
         are excluded. Total civil filings were 58,293;' cases disposed of
        were 55,416 or 2,887 less than the number filed; and the number
        of pending civil actions increased to 64,128 at the end of the year,
      an     increase of approximately five per cent.
           The median time interval from filing to disposition of civil cases
        terminated by trial in the district courts in 1961 decreased to 16.5
        months compared with 17.8 months last year and the median
     . time interval from issue to trial likewise decreased to 11.2 months
        compared with 11.5 months in 1960. These decreases, however,
     .i were dUe in'part to a slight revision in the method used in comput­

     . ihg the intervals. Twenty-four district Courts during 1961 had a
        median time interval from issue to trial of six months or less.
           Crimlnal cases filed during the year were' 28,460--involving a
        totai of 35,139 defendants. Charges against 34,403 defendants
        were finally disposed of during the year' and on June 30, 1961 there
      . were 11,440 defendants awaiting trial or senterice. The pending
        figure includes 1,247 defendants who on that date had been fugi­
        tives for six months or more, or were serving in the armed forces.
                                   62 

    For the fifth consecutive year, bankruptcy cases filed reached
 an all time peak. The total filings were 146,643, an increase of one- ( 

 third over 1960. A record 117,943 cases were closed during the
 year, or 18,626 more than last year. Nevertheless, filings out­
 stripped terminations by 28,700 cases and the pending caseload
 increased to a new all time high of 123,690, an increase of thirty per
 cent as compared with the number pending at the end of the previ­
 ous year.
 PROGRAM TO REDUCE COURT CONGESTION AND DELAY IN LITIGATION

      Mr. Olney reported to the Conference that as of June 30, 1961,
   there were 7,065 civil actions pending on the dockets of the district
   courts, which on that date had been awaiting disposition for three
 . years or more, including 994 pending land condemnation cases.
   While almost one-half of these cases appear on the dockets in six
   districts-Southern District of N ew York, Eastern District of New
   York, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Eastern District of
   Louisiana, Northern District of California and the Northern Dis­
   trict of Illinois-the problem of the disposition of the older civil
   cases exists in most districts.
      Mr. Olney proposed, therefore, that, as an initial step toward       (
   curtailing delay in litigation in the district courts, the Conference
   undertake a new plan and program for the disposition of these cases
  in all districts within a reasonable time. This plan of attacking
   court congestion by making a first objective the elimination of the
   oldest cases by a fixed date in each circuit would have the follow­
   ing advantages:
      (1) An immediate beginning can be made without having to
. wait for the full augmentation through judicial appointments of
  the total number of authorized judges.
      (2) The termination of this oldest group of approximately 7,000
 . cases within a reasonable time is not too large a task and is un­
   doubtedly within the capabilities of the present number of judges.
      (3) If a reasonable time is allowed for the task and a date fixed
   in each circuit for itS accomplishment, the necessary judicial as­
   sistance from other districts and circuits can be mustered.
      (4) Progress in carrying out the plan can be recorded as made
. and published to the very great benefit of the judiciary as well as
   to the litigants. and the public.
                                                                           (
                                     63
       The Conference carefully considered the plan proposed and after
    full discussion voted to approve the following recommendations of
    the Director:
       (1) That the Judicial Conference of the United States declare
    it to be the policy of the judiciary that every case pending three
    years or more and appropriate for trial be regarded as a judicial
    emergency by all the judges of any circuit where such cases are
    to be found, and
       (2) That the Conference request each circuit, through the
    judicial council, to make appropriate plans for mustering the avail­
    able judges of the circuit to pretry, try, and eliminate these cases
    from the dockets by a date certain, fixed in advance in each circuit
    with regard to the size of the task.

                 SURVEY OF JUDICIAL BUSINESS
       The Conference received reports from the Chief Judge of the
    Court of Claims, the Chief Judge of the Court of Customs and
    Patent Appeals, and from the chief judges of the respective circuits
    concerning the state of the dockets in each circuit and district.
(   These reports were supplemented by the district judges who pre­
    sented additional details concerning the business of the district
    courts in their circuits. It was the view of the members of the
    Conference that the 73 additional judgeships provided by the Act
    of May 19, 1961, would provide a sufficient number of judges in
    each circuit to administer the present caseload and to make a
    start toward the reduction of the backlog of civil actions. However,
    additional judicial assistance will be required on a temporary basis,
    to assist the judges in certain heavily congested districts in reduc­
    ing the backlog.

                    JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
       The Chainnan of the Committee on the Budget, Chief Judge
    William A. Campbell, submitted to the Conference the appropria­
    tion estimates for the fiscal year 1963 for the judiciary. The esti­
    mates, which had been prepared by the Director of the
    Administrative Office pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 605 and which were
    examined and approved by the Committee, totalled $58,057,500, an
    increase of $3,498,750 over the adjusted appropriations for the fiscal
    year 1962. On recommendation of the Committee, the budget
                                 64 

estimates presented were approved by the Conference, subject to
amendments which JIlay be required by other action of the Con­
ference at this session.
                  SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS

    The passage of the Omnibus Judgeship Bill authorizing the
creation of 73 additional judgeships required submission of sup­
 plemental appropriation estimates for the fiscal year 1962 for
 the salaries and expenses of the new judges and their staffs.
 The estimates were submitted on the basis that the new
 judges and their staffs would be on the rolls for an average of nine
months of the fiscal year 1962. Recurring expense items, such as
 travel and communication services, were computed on the same
 basis. However, the full amount estimated to be required to
initially equip the judges' chambers was requested, because, even
though the new judges may not enter on duty until late in the fiscal
year, it would be necessary immediately to provide libraries and
general office equipment. It was also found to be necessary to
request funds to augment the Administrative Office clerical staff.
The total of the estimates submitted on this basis was $4,383,000.
The Committee reported that the House Deficiency Subcommittee
in its report rendered on September 12, 1961, had recommended
the sum of $2,980,000. .
  . The Conference approved the recommendations of the Budget
Committee that the Director of the Administrative Office be au­
thorized to revise the 1963 estimates under the two bankruptcy
items in the event of a sharp fluctuation in case filings and to sub­
mit to the Congress estimates of supplemental appropriations for
fiscal year 1962 for any reason which at the time of the submission
of these estimates could not have been anticipated.
    The Committee reported that the Bureau of the Budget had
suggested that the jUdiciary amend its estimates for the fiscal year
1962 to include some $200,000 as rent for space to be used by other
governmental agencies to make room for the additional employees
to be hired by the Judicial Branch of the Government, if the
money requested therefor were allowed. It was the position of the
Administrative Office that there was no good reason for the judi­
ciary to request funds of the Congress with which to pay rent for
space to be occupied by Executive Agencies. With the approval
                                                                        (
                                     65
     of the Chairman of the Budget Committee, the Bureau of the
     Budget was so informed.
       The Committee also reported that in accordance with the policy
     of the Bureau of the Budget requiring each departmental agency
    of the Government to budget its own furniture and furnishings,
     the supplemental budget estimates to cover the expenses of the
    new judges were initially prepared to include the cost of purchasing
    furniture and furnishings for judges' chambers and courtrooms.
    While these estimates were pending before the Bureau of the
    Budget, the Administrative Office was informed that the Bureau
    had reversed its policy regarding budgets for furniture and re­
    quested that the amount included for furniture in the estimates for
    the judiciary be withdrawn. In compliance with this recommen­
    dation of the Bureau of the Budget, the estimates of the judi­
    ciary and the General Services Administration were so amended.
    For the fiscal year 1962, the General Services Administration will
    assume the responsibility of purchasing furniture and furnishings
    for the courts. However, the funds therefor are included in the
    1962 appropriations for the judiciary, so that the General Services
    Administration will be reimbursed periodically for items purchased.
(      The Budget Committee Chairman presented a further detailed
    report of the Committee's activities, including numerous recom­
    mendations, all of which were approved by the Conference.

                     COURT ADMINISTRATION
      The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration, Chief
    Judge John Biggs, Jr., reported on the following matters within
    the jurisdiction of the Committee.                           .

                   ADDITIONAL DISTRIcrS AND DIVISIONS

       The Conference upon recommendation of the Committee dis­
    approved the following bills to create new judicial districts, or to
    establish new divisions within existing judicial districts:
       (l) S. 61, S. 1824, H.R. 5085, H.R. 5525, H.R. 7029, andH.R.
    8834, 87th Congress, to create a new judicial district in the State
    of Florida.
       (2) S. 1855 and H.R. 7533, 87th Congress, to create a new judi­
    cial district in the State of North Dakota.
(
                                 66
   (3) H,R. 6306, 87th Congress, to create a new division in the 

Southern District of Indiana.                  _

   (4) S. 2033 and H.R. 7359, 87th Congress, to create a new divi­

sion in the Northern District of Georgia. 

   The Conference directed that the views of the Judicial Council
of the Eighth Circuit on H.R. 8216 and S. 2270, 87th Congress,
to transfer certain counties from the Western Division of the
Western District of Missouri to the St. Joseph Division, be ascer­
tained by the Administrative Office and that those views be re­
ported by the Director to Congress.
                   GEOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION

 . The Conference reviewed its procedure for the consideration
of legislation introduced in Congress with regard to additional
districts, divisions and places of holding court and with regard
to the furnishing of court facilities at places of holding court.
   After full discussion, the Conference directed that any bill to
create a new judicial district, to establish a new division within
any existing judicial district, to authorize a new place for holding
federal court, or to waive the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 142 respect­
ing the furnishing of accommodations at places of holding court be         )
submitted by the Director of the Administrative Office first to the
Judicial Council of the Circuit involved for its consideration and
recommendation, which shall then be transmitted by the Director
to the Committee on Court Administration for its consideration
and report to the Judicial Conference.
            REORGANIZATION OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS

   At the request of Chief Judge Jones of the Court of Claims, the
Conference deferred consideration at the present time of the pro­
posals contained in S. 839, S. 1235 and H.R. 6851, 87th Congress,
to reorganize the Court of Claims by establishing separate trial
and appellate divisions. These bills htid previously been referred
to the Committee for study and report to the Conference.
              RETIREMENT OF JUSTICES AND JUDGES

  n.R. 5282 and S. 2285, 87th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C.
371(b) to provide an administrative pro rata retirement plan fOr
justices and judges. The bill provides that a justice or judge may     (
                                        67 


      retire at age 65 with a minimum of ten years' service, if he would
(     agree to accept in lieu of the full salary of his office during the
      remainder of his lifetime, that portion of the salary of his office
      which is equal to the ratio existing between the aggregate number
      of his years of judicial service and fifteen years. The Conference
      granted leave to the Committee to study the matter further and
      to report thereon to the next session of the Conference.

      REPRESENTATION OF DISTRICT JUDGES ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS
                                OF THE CIRCUITS

          H.R. 6690 and S. 1933, 87th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C.
       332 to provide that there be added to the membership of the
       Judicial Council of each circuit, as presently constituted, two
       district judges in every circuit having five or more circuit judges
       in regular active service, and one district judge in any circuit hav­
       ing less than five circuit judges in regular active service. The bills
       further provide that one of the district judges on the Judicial
       Council in every case shall be the district judge selected to repre­
       sent his circuit on the Judicial Conference of the United States.
       The second district judge shall be one who is chosen at the annual
(	     judicial conference of the circuit who shall be from a district
       different than that of the district judge then serving as a member
       of the Judicial Conference of the United States, except in the
     · case of the District of Columbia Circuit. The judge so chosen
       would serve for a term of three years. After full consideration,
       the Conference voted to approve the bills.

                          SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES

        . At the request of Senator James O. Eastland, Chairman of the
       Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate, the
       Conference at its last session referred to the Committee for study,
       S. 1268, 87th Congress, relating to (1) the selection of chief judges
     .ofthe circuits and of multiple-judge district courts, (2) the terms
     · of service of chief judges, and (3) the powers and responsibilities
       of chief judges. with respect to the general administrative super­
       intendence of the business of the circuit and district courts.
          The Committee reported that it is aware of the importance of
       the role of the chief judges of circuits and multiple-judge district
     ·courts, if the administrative processes of such courts are to be
           622988-62--8
                                    68 

 successfully carried out and that the members of the Committee,
 and the members of a subcommittee appointed by the Chairman,                 (
 have spent considerable time and energy in trying to effect some
 feasible and satisfactory solution to the administrative problems
 presented. The Conference, at the request of the Committee,
 authorized further study of the proposals contained in S. 1268.

                     PANEL OF ANTITRUST JUDGES

     H.R. 6766, 87th Congress, would amend the Expediting Act, 15
   U.S.C. 28, 65 Stat. 195, to provide that the Chief Justice of the 

   United States, with the advice of the chief judge of each circuit, 

   would set up a national panel of antitrust judges to try cases 

   brought by the United States as plaintiff under the Sherman or 

 . Clayton Antitrust Acts, when an expediting certificate is filed by 

   the Attorney General stating that in his opinion the case is of 

. national public importance and the proceedings are likely to be 

 .protracted. The Conference was of the view that it was inap­

  propriate for the ChiefJustice of the United States to make such 

  an aSsignmeIlt and designation of district judges to try antitrust 

  ~ases and, therefore, voted to disapprove the bill.
     The Conference, however,directed the Committee on Revision (
. of the Laws to ·give consideration to the proposal that the testi­
  mony in a civil antitrust case in which an expediting certificate has
  been filed by the Attorney General be taken before a single dis­
  trict judge rather than a district court of three judges.

              DISQUALIFICATION FOR BIAS OR PREJUDICE

     S.1477, 87th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 144 to provide
 _that an .affidavit of bias.~ani:Lprejudiceagainsta judge &hall be
  deemedt6 be timely ,if filed at least teri days before the commence­
  ment ofhearings on the matters in issue or if nled at the first ses­
. sian of the court at which such niatter or issue is heard·aft,er
  discovery· by .the affiant of the facts upon which the affidavit is
  baSed, "or if good cause shall be shown for failure to file it within
  such time." The bill further provides that a second or subsequent
  "such~'affidavit shall be deemed to be "ineffective" unless it states
. facts sufficient to establish piinia facie that bias or prejudice exists.
~ S;2478 a.ncfH.R. 8940, .87th· Congress, contain' similar provisions.
 ,.; The Conference discussed the proposals· contained ill. the bills
                                                   69 

          and voted to approve that portion of S. 2478 which requires a
    (     judge other than the one against whom the affidavit is filed to pass
          upon the legal sufficiency of the affidavit, but disapproved that
          part which would authorize the filing of a second affidavit. S.1477
          and H.R. 8940 were specifically disapproved.
             The Committees on Revision of the Laws and Court Administra­
          tion were directed to undertake a study of the provisions of 28
          U.S.C. 144 relating to the disqualification of judges.

                         QUALIFICATIONS OF JUSTICES AND JUDGES

            H.R. 5846 and H.R. 7753, 87th Congress, would amend 28
         U.S.C. 1 and 44 to provide certain qualifications for persons to
         be appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States or to the
         Courts of Appeals. Under the provisions of these bills persons
         appointed to the Supreme Court would be required to have from
         five to ten years service as a judge of a Court of Appeals or as
         a justice or judge of a state court and to have been admitted to
         practice in a state or a territorial court, or in the District of
         Columbia. Persons appointed to the Courts of Appeals would
         be required to have from three to five years experience as a judge
(        of a district court, or as a judge or justice of an appellate court
         of a state and to have been admitted to the practice of law as
         stated above. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
         ference disapproved the bills.

         PAYMENT OF FEES TO INTERPRETERS, PSYCHIATRISTS AND WiTNESSES

            The Conference at its March 1959 session referred to the Com­
         mittees on .Court Administration and Supporting Personnei the
          proposals to provide for the payment of witness' feeS and niileage
        .In habeas corpus         cases
                                 and in proceedings to vacate sentence under 

          28 U.S.C.2255, brought by persons authorized to proceed in 

          forma pauperis, and to provide for the payment of fees of inter­

          pretersand psychiatrists. Upon recommendation of the Coill­
        . mittees, the Conference approved the following new paragraph to 

          be added to 28 U.S.C. 1825, to authorize payment of witness fees. 

        '"'-,.               -.

  The Conference approved in principle the proposal to authorize 

the payment of the fees of interpreters and referred to the Com­

mittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure the following proposed 

subsections to Rule 28, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and 

Rule 44, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Federal Rules of Oriminal Procedure:
      Rule 28 (b) The court may appoint an interpreter of its own selection,
    and may determine the reasonable compensation of such interpreter, and
    direct its payment out of such funds as may be provided by law.
Federal Rules of Oivil Procedure:
      Rule 44(a) The court may appoint an interpreter of its own selection,
    and may determine the reasonable compensation of such interpreter, and
    direct its payment out of such funds as may be provided by law.
  It was the view of the Committees that the present provisions
and language of 18 U.S.C. 4244-48 were sufficient to permit the
employment of psychiatrists in criminal cases.
PAYMENT OF COURT REPORTERS WHO FAIL TO FILE TRANSCRIPTS OF
  PLEAS AND SENTENCING PROCEEDINGS IN CRIMINAL CASES AS RID­
  QUIRED BY 28 U.S.C. 753(b).

   The Director of the Administrative Office requested instructions
from the Conference with respect to paying court reporters who
                                                                               (   )
fail to file transcripts of pleas and sentencing proceedings in crim­
inal cases as required by 28 U.S.C. 753(b). The Director pointed
out that because questions about the legality of the proceedings
in criminal cases are raised with increasing frequency at dates
 long subsequent to the time of conviction, both in habeas corpus
proceedings and in the matter of petitions filed under Section 2255
of Title 28 U.S.C., it is especially important that the official record
of what took place, including the proceedings on arraignment,
plea and imposition of sentence, even in cases where a plea of
quilty is entered, be complete and be preserved. The Director
also pointed out that the Congress has recognized this need by
requiring in 28 U.S.c., Section 753, that the court reporter in a
United States District Court must "report all proceedings in crim­
inal cases had in open court" and must also "transcribe and certify
all pleas and proceedings in connection with the imposition of sen­
tence in criminal cases," regardless of whether an appeal is taken
or any request is made for the transcript.. The purpose of the
statute, it seems clear, is to insure perpetuity of the record .. This
                                                                               (

        is one of the services that the court reporter is required by the
(       statute to perform in order to earn his salary.
           In the case of Poole v. United States, 250 Fed. 2d. 396 (1957),
        the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
        Circuit in a decision, which appears to be binding upon the Direc­
        tor of the Administrative Office, held that compliance with 28
       U.S.C. 753(b) required that court reporters, without additional
       compensation, transcribe their notes and file transcripts of all pro­
       ceedings on arraignment, plea and sentence in criminal cases. The
       Director pointed out that the indications are that this is not being
       done in many districts.
          The general survey of the court reporting system in the federal
       courts in 1960 showed that in only two districts visited by the
       survey team was this provision of the law being complied with and
       that less than 25 percent of the federal district courts were in
       compliance.
          It was brought to the attention of the Conference that in June
       1959 the Administrative Office requested the clerks of all district
       courts to report the number of cases of criminal defendants con­
       victed and sentenced during the fiscal year 1958 in which typed
c'     and certified transcripts of the proceedings on plea and sentence
      had not been filed and to ascertain from the court reporters their
      best estimate of the number of man-hours that would be required
      to transcribe and certify the proceedings in conformity with the
      statute.
          The replies showed that in 64 percent of the criminal cases in
      that one year typed transcripts had not been made and filed and
      that the court reporters estimated it would require 41,444 hours
      to make the transcripts necessary to comply with the law for that
      one year.
       . The Director stated that there was no evidence suggesting that
      there was any more general compliance with the law by court
     reporters at the present time.
         The Director raised the question as to the propriety of his con­
     tinuing to pay the salaries of court reporters who constantly and
     continually fail to perform an important duty required by statute
     and requested instructions from the Conference in this regard.
         After a full discussion, the Conference authorized the Commit­
     tee to draft and seek a clarifying amendment to 28 U.S.C. 753(b)
     which would authorize the filing by the court reporter of an
                                 72 

electronic sound recording of the arraignment, plea and sentence in
criminal cases eliminating the necessity for transcription. The
Conference authorized the Director in the meantime to continue
salary payments to the court reporters and to instruct all court
reporters that hereafter they must either file a complete transcript
of all proceedings in connection with arraignment, pleas and im­
position of sentence in criminal cases, or file an adequately au­
thenticated electronic sound recording of such proceedings, and
that they should certify to the Director of the Administrative
Office quarterly or at such other suitable intervals as might be
fixed by him, that in all such proceedings heard within the quar­
terlyor other period ended six months prior to the certificate either
a transcript or an adequately certified electronic sound recording
had been filed with the clerk.
                DISBURSEMENT OF JUDICIARY FUNDS

  H.R. 8304, 87th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 711 and 751
to provide that the clerks of the courts of appeals .and distri<it
courts, respectively, subject to regulations prescribed by the Di­
rector of the Administrative Office, should disburse funds ap-.
propriated for the maintenance and operation of the courts. It          ()
was brought to the attention of the Conference that the personnel
in the clerks' offices in some districts may be inadequate to per­
form the disbursing function, and that the enactment of this
bill may require additional supporting personnel. The Conference
referred the matter to the Committee for further consideration in
accor~ance with this suggestion.

                 JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT

 . The Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of the proposal con­
tained in H.R. 8048, 87th Congress, to amend the Judicial Sur­
vivors Annuity Act to provide that if. a widow has remarried, but
if her marriage has been terminated by divorce upon her applica­
tion and without fault on her part, she may receive the annuity
provided by the statute.
                         TRAVEL EXPENSES

  In view of the recent amendment to the Travel Expense Act, the
Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative Office to
                                      73 

increase the authorized per diem for judicial employees traveling
on official business from $12 to $16 and to allow reimbursement for
parking fees as permitted under the statute. The Conference di­
rected that the allowance of 10 cents per mile for the use of pri­
vately owned automobiles and the limitation of a maximum of $25
subsistence per day for those traveling on an actual expense basis
remain unchanged.

                    SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
  The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Personnel,
Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., submitted the report of the Com­
mittee to the Conference.

                         JUDICIAL SALARY PLAN

   There was presented to the Conference a revised, comprehensive
judicial salary plan, designed to provide an equitable classifica­
tion of employees in the clerks' offices, probation offices, and the
referees' offices of the district courts. The plan had previously
been submitted to the Committee by the Director of the Adinin,.
istrative Office in accordance with the direction of the Conference
atits March 1961 session (Conf. Rept., pAO). !twas developed
after careful research, consultation with court officials, and an ex­
tensive survey by the Administrative Office staff of the court offices
in seventeen widely scattered districts.
   The Conference, after full consideration, voted to approve the
new salary plan and directed that it be put into effect as appro-:­
priated funds become available.      .

                             COURT OF CLAIMS

  A request had been made by Chief Judge Marvin Jones of the
Court of Claims for authority to appoint additional law clerks for
the court to assist the trial commissioners in the preparation of
their reports.·· The Committee reported favorably on the request,
and the Conference approved the following resolution:
  Resolved that the Judicial Conference approve a request that provision be
~ade  for a law clerk for the chief trial commissioner of the Court of Claims
and a sufficient number of additional law clerks to provide one for each two of
the remaining trial commissioners.                                     . ..
                                 74
  The following legislative proposals, presented by the Court of
Claims were referred to the Committee on Supporting Personnel
for study and report to the Conference.
   (1) To authorize the appointment by the court of additional
commissioners as needed, not to exceed a tDtal of twenty.
   (2) To provide for the commissioners the same type of retire­
ment system as is now applicable to judges of The Tax Court of
the United States (26 U.S.C. 7447).
PROCEEDINGS OF CIRCUIT CoNFERENCES AND JUDICIAL SEMINARS

   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
had recently requested authorization by the Administrative Office
for the payment of the cost of providing a verbatim record of
the proceedings of the annual circuit conference of the District
of Columbia Circuit. The Administrative Office has had similar
requests in the past and since 1940 has authorized payment to
official court reporters for the preparation of the transcripts of
the annual judicial conferences of the Fourth and Ninth Circuits
in accordance with the transcript rates prescribed by the Con­
ference. It was the sense of the Committee that there was need         ()
for a verbatim record of some of the proceedings of circuit con~
ferences, seminars, institutes on sentencing, and other such meet­
ings concerning judicial functions, and accordingly the Committee
recommended that the Conference direct the Budget Committee
to recommend a sum to be included in the judiciary budget for
the taking and transcription of such verbatim records as may be
desired or required. This recommendation was approved by the
Conference.
                   APPOINTMENT OF BAILIFFS

  The Attorney General has recently proposed that the authority
to appoint bailiffs be transferred from the United States marshals
to the United States Courts. This recommendation had previ­
ously been approved by the Conference (Rept., Sept. 1957, p. 18),
but the Attorney General subsequently withdrew his support and
appproval of the proposal. The Committee called attention to
an excerpt from a letter by the Chief Justice to the Director of the
Bureau of the Budget, which sets forth cogent reasons why the
United States marshals should appoint bailiffs rather than the
United States Courts. The excerpt is as follows:
                                          75
      There is avery real need from time to time for the presence in federal
    courtrooms, particularly the District Courts, but occasionally the Courts of
    Appeals, and, without regard for whether the particular proceedings are crimi­
    nal or civil in nature, for someone with the authority. training, and physical
    stamina of a law enforcement officer to k~p order and also to be prepared
    to provide adequate physical proteetion for the litigants, the witnesses, and
    sometimes the judges of the courts. This is in fact the principal reason that
    the courts presently call upon the United States marshals for the necessary
    bailiffs to attend the court under authorization of Sections 713 and 755 of
    Title 28. To meet this need adequately, it is, in my opinion, necessary that
    the personnel involved, whether called bailiffs or deputy marshals, have the
    training and physical standards of law enforcement officers, as well as the
    legal authority of law enforcement officers, and also that they not be isolated
    but be members of an appropriate law enforcement organization interested
    in them and upon which they can call for supplemental help, if neeessary.
    I very much doubt if these standards could be maintained and this need
    adequately met if the bailiffs were severed from their present relationship with
    the office of the United State marshal.

      The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, with­
    drew'its prior recommendation that the authority to appoint
    bailiffs be transferred from the United States marshals to the
    United States courts or to the judges, and voted to disapprove the
    legislation now proposed by the Attorney General.

                        NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS
(
       The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee,
    authorized an increase in the salary of the national park commis­
    sioner for Mt. Rainier National Park to a maximum of $6,400
    per annum, provided that this, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 631,
    meets with the approval of the United States District Court for
    the Western District of Washington .
                             •   COURT REPORTERS

       The Director of the Administrative Office called to the atten tion
    of the Conference the need for the appointment of additional court
    reporters as a result of the recent Omnibus Judgeship Bill. The
    Conference, thereupon, authorized the appointment of 63 addi­
    tional court reporters for the district courts to correspond with the
    number of additional district judgeships created by Public Law
    87-36, approved May 19, 1961, at the salaries recommended by the
    Direcror.

        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE

   The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice
and Procedure, Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, infornied the Con­
ference that the work of the Committee was steadily progressing.
Meetings of several advisory committees have been scheduled for
the near future and the Committee expects shortly to have a tenta­
tive draft of a revision of some of the rules of practice and
procedure.
   The attention of the Conference was called to the recent amend­
ment to Rule 25(d) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, with respect
to the substitution of public officers, which became effective on
July 19, 1961 and a similar amendment to Rule 48 of the Rules
of the Supreme Court of the United States, which became effective
on June 19, 1961. It was pointed out that some of the courts of
appeals have similar rules governing the substitution of public
officers as parties to an appeal. The Committee suggested; there­
fore, that any such rules be· reexamined by the various courts. of
appeals in the light of the above amendments, and the Conference
directed that the matter be brought to the attention of-the court
of appeals in each circuit.
                                                                        ()
                  REVISION OF THE LAWS

   Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chainnan of the Committee of
Revision of the Laws, submitted a comprehensive Committee
report.
 . (1) The Conference gave its specific approval to the following
bills pending in the 87th Congress, which would c3.rry out -proposals
approved, in whole or in part, by the Conference at previous
sessions:
        (a) S. 1662 and H.R. 5753 to abolish terms of district court
     and to provide that the district courts shall be incontiIiuouS
    session~
       (b) S. 1802, H.R. 7229, H.R. 7314 and H.R. 7425, requiring
    that proposed consent decrees in antitrust cases be.published
    in the Federal· Register at least thirty days prior to their
    entry. The requirement would apply to orders entered. by
    a district court and in proceedings by any board orcoIn,l1:Qs­
    sion for the enforcement of the Clayton Act 9r t4~cFederal
                                                                        C)
                                            77 

                  Trade Commission Act. These bills are similar to H.R. 836
                  which was approved by the Conference at its March 1961
                  session. (Conf. Rept., p. 18).
                      (c) S. 1898, relating to the jurisdiction of the district courts
                  in actions commenced by fiduciaries by reason of diversity of
                  citizenship. A practice, it seems, has arisen in some districts
                  of procuring the appointment of a non-resident fiduciary for
                  a decedent, or minor having a claim against a local resident,
                  in order to create diversity of citizenship. The bill, which is
                  identical to H.R. 5344 approved by the Conference at its
                  March 1961 session, would withdraw federal jurisdiction in
                  such cases.
                     (d) S. 1900 and H.R. 5255, to clarify the status of federal
                  judges retired from regular active service. The bill would
                  amend 28 U.S.C. 43(b) to provide that the court of appeals
                  shall consist of the circuit judges of the circuit in regular
                  active service, but would provide that a circuit judge of the
                  circuit who has retired from regular active service shall also
                 be competent to sit as a judge of the court in bane in the
                  rehearing of a case or controversy, if he sat in the court or
(                division at the original hearing thereof. The bill would also
                 make it clear that the Judicial Council of each circuit is to
                 consist of the circuit judges for the circuit in regular active
                 service and that each district court shall consist of the district
                 judge or judges of the district in regular active service. The
             , ,Conference voted to reaffirm its approval of the bill, as
                 introduced.
                   . (e) S. 2061 and' H.R. 6902, to provide life tenure for the
                 United States district judges for the District of Puerto Rico.
                    ,(f) H.R. 5615, to amend the Judicial Survivors Annuity
                 Act so as to accord with present statutory provisions appli­
              •• cable to surviving dependents of members of Congress. The
                 Civil Service Retirement Act amendent of 1956 with respect
                 to survivorship benefits for dependents of members of Con­
                 gress, eliminated the requirement that a widow without de­
                 pendent children be 50 years of age before receiving a widow's
                 annuity, increased the annuity payable to dependent children,
               'liberalized the formulaforcomputini!; the widow's annuity
    --':,' in-respect tocertaineivilian service; and increased the maxi­
     .:c:..,: 'inumwidow's :annuity to 40 percent 'of the, decedent's five­
     \
                                 78 

     year average salary. The bill would make the same pro­
     visions applicable to surviving dependents of judges. (Conf.
     Rept., March 1961, p. 21).

                    RETIRED TERRITORIAL JUDGES

  The Conference considered the proposal contained in S. 1897,
87th Congress, to authorize retired judges of certain territorial
courts to perform judicial service, when designated and assigned,
and expressed some concern over the assignment of such a judge to
active service when he may be engaged in the practice of law.
The Committee was authorized to give further consideration to
this problem.
                   COURT OF VETERANS' APPEALS

   H.R. 3263, H.R. 4134, and H.R. 5992, 87th Congress, would
establish a court of veterans' appeals and prescribe its jurisdiction
and functions. Similar bills were considered by the Conference at
its March 1961 session and approved as to the type of judicial
review proposed, but disapproved to the extent that they would
amend 28 U.S.c. 451 and 610 to include the proposed new court
                                                                            \
among the courts of the United States and to require the Director           J
of the Administrative Office to assume responsibility for its ad­
ministrative affairs. The Conference reaffirmed its action with
respect to the proposals contained in these bills.

   COMPENSATION CLAIMS FOR SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITY

  H.R. 4696, 87th Congress, would provide for the determination
by the district courts of disputed claims for compensation on ac­
count of disability or death resulting from disease or injury aggra­
vated in line of duty while serving in the armed forces. The
Conference previously disapproved proposals to permit the judicial
review of veterans' claims by the district courts and, upon recom­
mendation of the Committee, voted also to disapprove this bill.

                       DEPORTATION ORDERS

 S. 2212, 87th Congress, is identical to H.R. 187, 87th Congress,
which was approved by the Conference at its March 1961 session
msofar as it relates to the judicial review of deportation orders.      (
                                 79 

 Noting, however, that the bill would limit the review of orders of
 exclusion to review by \\-'Tits of habeas corpus, which would seem
 to deny review to any nonresident alien (who is not in custody),
 the Conference voted to approve S. 2212, but expressed no opinion
 with respect to those provisions which propose to limit the review
 of orders of exclusion to writs of habeas corpus.

                          STUDY OF VENUE

     Judge Maris reported that a subcommittee had been appointed
  to study the subject of venue and that at its request a survey of
  recommendations for changes in the law regulating process and
  venue in the district courts had been prepared by Professor Degnan
. and Mr. Martino of the University of Utah College of Law. The
  Committee was granted leave to continue its study of the subject
  of venue and to report at a later session of the Conference.

                 UNITED STATES AS AMIOUS CURIAE

   H.J. Res. 199, 87th Congress, would prohibit the United States
from appearing as amicus curiae or in any other fashion, except
as a party, in any stage of any civil action in any federal court.
Experience has shown that in many cases it is in the public interest
for the Federal Government to be permitted, in the discretion of
the court, to appear as amicus curiae. Upon recommendation of
the Committee, the Conference disapproved the bill.

                    INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT

   The Bureau of the Budget had requested the comments of the
Judicial Conference with respect to H.R. 5594, 87th Congress, to
amend Section 22(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act with respect
to the service of process in enforcement proceedings involving
motor carriers or brokers. It was the view of the Committee that
the method of enforcing the Interstate Commerce Act with respect
to motor carriers and brokers would appear to involve a question
of policy for the Congress and the Executive Branch of the Govern­
ment. The Conference, therefore, directed that the Bureau of the
Budget be informed that the Judicial Conference does not deem
it appropriate to express any views with respect to the bilL
                                 80 

.JURISDICTION IN CASES INVOLVING POLLUTION OF INTERSTATE RIVER
                              SYSTEMS

   H.R. 6717, 87th Congress, would provide that the United States
district courts shall have jurisdiction of certain cases involving
pollution of int.erstate river systems. The bill would give to the
district courts original jurisdiction, concurrently with the Supreme
Court, of cases arising under a proposed interstate compact, which
involve pollution of the waters of the river system which is the
subject of the compact. Because of the constitutional question
involved with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the
Conference voted to make no recommendation with respect to the
bill.
                     CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS

   H.R. 4068, 87th Congress, would confer jurisdiction upon the
district courts of suits to review state action establishing Congres­
sional districts. It was the view of the Conference and the Com­
mittee that the grant of jurisdiction to the district courts proposed
by the bill involves a question of public policy for Congress to de­
termine. The Conference directed that the Committee on the
JUdiciary of the House of Representatives be informed that it           (\
makes no recommendation concerning the proposal.
          VENUE IN ACTIONS INVOLVING PUBLIC LANDS

   S. 717, H.R. 4428, H.R. 5236, H.R. 5407, and H.R. 5938, 87th
Congress, would authorize the institution of a civil action for the
review of an administrative determination as to the use of lands of
the United States for grazing purposes in the judicial district in
which such lands are situated; H.R. 5976, 87th Congress, would
broaden the venue in certain actions against the Secretary of the
Interior or his subordinates involving public lands.
  These bills would accomplish to a limited extent the broadening
of venue and service of process which would be accomplished in all
suits against Government officers by the enactment of H.R. 1960,
87th Congress, which was approved by the Conference at its March
1961 session. Since these bills would accomplish in part the
purposes of H.R. 1960, they were approved by the Conference.
        REVIEW OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

  S.2398, and H.R. 8189, 87th Congress, would require that cer- ( .
tain proceedings for the review or enforcement of agency orders~
                                 81 

must be instituted in the judicial circuit within which the con­
troversy or matter which is the subject of the order arose. It was
the view of the Committee that the existing venue provisions with
respect to the review or enforcement of agency orders in the courts
of appeals are in most instances adequate and satisfactory and that
it would be unwise and not in the public interest to alter them in the
general and summary fashion proposed by these bills. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference disapproved
the bills.
                  PRODUCTION OF STATE RECORDS

   S.2161, 87th Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 2201 to au­
thorize actions for declaratory judgment to determine the au­
thority of congressional committees to require the production of
official records of state or local governmental bodies. The Con­
ference directed that the Committee on the Judiciary of the United
States Senate be informed that the proposal contained in this bill
concerns a matter of policy for the determination of the Congress
upon which the Conference expresses no view.

             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
              SALARIES AND POSITIONS OF REFEREES

    The Conference was informed by the Chairman of the Com­
mittee on Bankruptcy Administration, Senior Judge Orie L.
 Phillips, that the Committee had met and considered the recom­
 mendations contained in the Report of the Director of the Admin­
istrative Office, dated June 26, 1961, relating to the continuance
of referee positions to become vacant prior to April 1, 1962 by
 expiration of term, for changes in salaries of referees, changes in
arrangements, and the creation of new referee positions. The
 Committee also considered the recommendations of the district
judges and the judicial councils of the circuits concerned.
  . The Conference considered fully the Committee's report, as well
.as the recommendations of the Director, the circuit councils and
 the district judges. On the basis of these reports, the Conference
 took the action shown in the following table relating to changes in
salaries and new referee positions and directed that, unless other­
wise noted, this action become effective on November 16, 1961,
 provided appropriated funds are available:

                 PENDING AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION

DiBchargeability of Debts
   R.R. 1742, 87th Congress, would amend Section 2a of the
Bankruptey Act, 11 U.S.C. l1(a), by adding at the end thereof a
new subsection which would give to the Bankruptcy Court jurisdic­
tion to determine the dischargeability or nondischargeability of
provable debts. Upon recommendation of the Committee the
Conference reaffirmed its approval of this bill.
  *To be effective when appropriated funds are available.
                                                                                    (

     Priority Claims, Statutory Liens and Title to Property
         H.R. 1961 and S. 1142, 87th Congress, would amend Sections 1,
     17a, 57j, 64a(5), 67b and 70c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 1,
     35(a), 93(j), 104(a)(5), 107(b) and 110(c), relating to priority
      claims, statutory liens, and title to property. While preserving the
     present position of the costs of administration and wages in the
     distribution of the assets of a bankrupt, these bills would enahle
     valid contractual liens such as chattel mortgages, conditional sales
     contracts, trust receipts and the like, to retain their position ahead
     of statutory liens on personal property unaccompanied by posses­
     sion. The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representa­
     tives has reported favorably on H.R. 1961 with an amendment
     deemed necessary because of the decision in Lewis, Trustee v.
     Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, 364 U.S. 603, which over­
     ruled Constance v. Harvey, 215 F. 2d 57l. Upon recommendation
     of the Committee, the Conference approved H.R. 1961 as so
     amended.
    Summary Jurisdiction
        H.R. 4855, 87th Congress, would amend Sections 6Ob, 67e, and
I   70e of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 96(b), 107(e) and 110(e),
     to give the Bankruptcy Court summary jurisdiction in actions
    involving preferences, liens and fraudulent transfers, and the
    trustee's title to property. This legislation has been previously ap­
    proved by the Conference and upon recommendation of the Com­
    mittee the Conference reaffirmed its approval of the proposals
    contained in the bill.
    Claims in Chapter XI Cases
        H.R. 4856, 87th Congress, would amend various sections of the
     Bankruptcy Act to require the filing of claims in Chapter XI
    cases within the time prescribed by Section 57n of the Bankruptcy
    Act. The bill embodies a proposal previously approved by the
    Conference at its September 1960 session (Conf. Rept., p. 24).
    Upon the Committee's recommendation the Conference reaffirmed
    its approval of the proposals contained in the bill.
    Attorneys' Fees
        H.R. 5149, 87th Congress, would amend Section 60d of the
    Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 96(d), to give the bankruptcy court on
    its own motion, or on petition of the bankrupt made prior to the
                                     88
   granting of the discharge, jurisdiction to determine the reasona:ble­
   ness of fees paid, or agreed to be paid, to his attorney for services
   rendered, or to be rendered. The proposal contained in this bill
   is identical to that previously approved by the Conference at its
  March 1960 session (Conf. Rept., p. 19). The Conference reaf­
   firmed its approval of the legislation.
  Referee'~ Retirement and Salary Bill
      H.R 5341, 87th Congress, would amend the Bankruptcy Act
  to provide:
      (1) Terms of 12 years for full-time referees.
      (2) Maximum salary limitations of $17,500 for a full-time
 .xeferee and $8,500 for a part-time referee, with an increase for the 

  Chief of the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office. 

      (3) . Compensation for services of a retired referee.         .

      (4). A more liberal retirement annuity, and mandatory retire­

  ment at age 75, for referees. ' 

      This bill embodies the recommendation of the Conference with 

  respect to the terms of referees, retirement aildsalary, and the 

  Conference reaffirmed its approval of the legislation. 

  Omnibu8 Bill                                                                  (
     H.R 5393, 87th Congress-the so-called noncontroversial omni­

  bus bill-provides for several clarifying, perfecting and conforming 

  improvements in the Bankruptcy Act. '. Upon recommendation of 

  the Committee the Conference approved the bill.          .

     Rule8 of Practice and Procedure
        H.R 7405, 87th Congress, would provide for the promulgation 

     of nIles of practice and procedure under the Bankruptcy Act by 

     the Supreme- Court of the United States. Upon recommen:dation 

     of the Committee' the Conference reaffirmed its approv~l' of this

        S. 113 and H.R 3329, 87th Congress, would amend Section

     the amount of the priority of wages, salaries and' commissions

           with respect to S. 113, and the matter was referred to the Com­
           mittee by the Administrative Office.
              It was the view of the Committee that the proposal contained
           in the bill involves a question of public policy to be determined
           by the Congress and was not a matter on which it should expres.s
           any view. Accordingly, the Conference took no action.
           Railroad Reorganizations
             The Committee reported that the proposal contained in S. 1624,
           87th Congress, to amend Seetion 77 of the Bankruptcy Act and
           Section 20(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act relating to the re­
           organization of railroads, had been referred to a subcommittee for
           study and report to the Bankruptcy Committee.

           Appointment of Receivers and Trustees and Audit of Statistical
              Reports

                 The Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office has con­

              tinued its examination of statistical reports in order to reduce the 

             number of errors in the computation of charges for the Referees' 

      (      Salary and Expense Fund and the overallowance of feeS to re­

             ceivers and trustees, and to discover the existence of any monopoly 

           .situations in the appointment of receivers and tr:ustees. This re­
             view has resulted in a notable reduction in the num~r, of errors
             and in bringing to light any monopoly situations.           .    ..
               . The program of the Administrative Office now provides for the
             auditor the statistical reports of each referee's office for ,atleast
             two months of each 'year and where referees' rifficeshaveshown;a
           ;high frequency of error,' their reports. will be audited each month
             u!ltil a continuous period of six monthS elapses without error. At
             that time the regular auditing schedule will be followed., The
            statistical reports of all newly appointed referees will be audited
          , monthly until it can be determined that the reports received fro in
             their offices are accurate.
            Accountability of Referees, Receivers and Tril$tees
            , The Conference at its March 19,61 session referred to a sub com­

          . mittee,. consisting 'of Circuit Judge Hamlin, Chairman, .,Circuit

trustees and charges for the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund. 

The subcommittee is continuing its study of the problem and will 

report to the Committee at a later date. 


                 SURVEY OF BANKRUPTCY OFFICES

    The continued increase in the number of bankruptcy cases filed
 in the district courts has brought into focus a number of problems
 incident to the necessary increase in the services of referees in the
 district courts. These include the creation of new part-time ref­
 eree positions, the consolidation of existing part-time positions
 into a single full-time position where practicable, and the eleva­
 tion of referee positions from a part-time basis to a full-time basis
 where justified by the volume of business.
    While the Committee recognizes the importance of having the
 full support of the courts and the referees in the administration of
 the bankruptcy system, it is of the view that if the intent and
spirit of the Referees' Salary Act are to be given effect, the estab­
lishment of full-time referee service, where it is clearly needed,
should not be indefinitely deferred because of personal considera­
tions of the incumbent referee.                                          (
   The Committee, therefore, recommended that wherever possi­
ble, part-time positions within the same district be consolidated
into a single full-time position, whenever such consolidation will
provide for the expeditious transaction of the bankruptcy business
of the court. This recommendation and the following general
guide lines to be followed by the Administrative Office in conduct­
ing surveys of bankruptcy offices were approved by the Conference:
   (1) That part-time referee positions be considered for change
to full-time status whenever the volume of business reaches ap­
proximately 600 average cases a year. ("Average" case refers to
the national average as to size and type of case).
   (2) That recommendations for the change of part-time posi­
tions be submitted, with or without the concurrence of the district
court, when surveys indicate that­
         (a) The extent and physical characteristics of the territory
      are such that it can be efficiently served by a single full-time
      referee,
                                 91
        (b) Whenever the volume of business exceeds the normal
     volume for efficient part-time service and in any event when
     the total filings reach 900 to 1,000 cases a year, and
        (c) New part-time positions should be recommended only
     when there is no other practical way to provide adequate
     referee service for the district.
           DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER XIII

   The Administrative Office has reported to the Committee a
continuing use of the provisions of Chapter XIII of the Bank­
ruptcy Act, covering wage earner plans for the payment of credi­
 tors. During the fiscal year 1961 there were 19,700 Chapter
XIII cases filed, an increase of more than 6,000 cases over 1960.
The Committee noted, however, a wide variance in the use of
Chapter XIII between districts in the same state, and even be­
tween referees' offices in the same district. There remains a large
number of districts that still receive no Chapter XIII cases.
   The Committee called attention to the value of the procedures
under Chapter XIII as reflected in the amounts paid to creditors
in Chapter XIII cases and in no-asset straight bankruptcy cases.
During the fiscal year 1960, the unpaid liabilities scheduled in the
63,086 straight bankruptcy cases closed during the year were
$469,865,567. During the same period the debts affected in the
5,920 Chapter XIII cases completed were $5,277,737, of which
$5,168,251, or 98 percent, was paid to creditors. The Administra­
tive Office is continuing its efforts to encourage the use of Chapter
XUI in appropriate cases.
                     MISCELLANEOUS MATrERS

Certification of Documents
  The Committee reported that the proposal to amend Section
21d of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 44(d), to provide that docu­
ments on file with the referee may be certified by an employee
designated by him, which was recommended by the Conference
in March 1961, had been forwarded by the Administrative Office
to the House Judiciary Committee with the request that it be
included in the Omnibus Noncontroversial Bankruptcy Bill, H.R.
5393, 87th Congress.

Deposit of Bankruptcy Funds                                                       (
  The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, ap­
proved the proposal to authorize the deposit of funds of bankrupt
estates in interest bearing accounts, such as time deposit accounts,
savings accounts and the like, so that some increment will accrue
to these estates. The Administrative Office was authorized to sub...
mit to Congress the following draft of an amendment to Section
47a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 75(a)(2), with respect
to the duties of the trustee:
       (2) Deposit all money reeeived by them in designated depositories ini­
    tially in demand deposits; and subsequently, if authorized by the court,
    in interest bearing savings deposits, time certificates of deposit, or time
    deposit-open accounts.
Modernization of Referees' Offices
   The Conference was informed that the consolidation of the
district court clerk's office and the referee's clerical staff in the
United States District Court at Chicago had been completed and
that new and modernized space,sciEmtifically designed to handle
the clerical work. of .the. court had h~en provided. Eventually,
ony one bankruptcy .docket for each case will be maintained in this
office, which will eliminate entirely the keeping of a separa~                    (
clerk's docket for bankruptcy cases.· It is believed that this con­
solidation will greatly reduce the _overall amount of· clerical :work,
as well as the cost ofboth offices. If silccessful, it-will provide
a pattern for installations of a. like nature in other large 9ffices~
Tra.ining Course for New Referees
  It was called to the attention of the. C9Ilference that 31 new
referees were appointed in the IS-month period ending July 1, 1961
and that eight additional new referee . Positions have now been
authorized. It was suggested to the Conference that much could
be gained from the attendance of new referees atmeetings concern~
ing bankruptcy administration, practices and procedures. It was
estimated that the cost would be approximately $9,OOO.UpoIl
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference authorized the
Director to seek the appropriation of the necessary funds for the
travel and subsistence expenses incident to such a meeting at the
earliest opportunity.                              .

    The Conference was informed that a petition for assistance and
 relief had been filed with the Judiciary Committee of the United
  States Senate, relative to the matter of the W oodmar Realty
  Company bankruptcy case, No. 3151, pending in the United States
  District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, Hammond
. Division. Many communications and memoranda concerning the
  case have been forwarded to the Chairman of the Bankruptcy
  Committee. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has
 recently handed down an opinion in the case, and a petition for
  rehearing is pending. It appears that many of the matters in­
  ~olved in the petitIon referred to are under consideration by the
  Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
   . The Committee reported that it had examined the petition,

  mitted and had unanimously decided that the Committee should
  take no aCtion. The Conference· approved the views of the Com­

  .The Chairman of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law, Chief Judge William F. Smith, presented the report
of the· Committee.

     FEES AND ALLOWANCES OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

   The Conference approved the following draft of a bill, submitted
by the Committee, to increase the maximum fees that may be
earned by a United States commissioner in one calendar year
from $10,500 to $12,500 and to increase generally the fees payable
to the United States commissioners.
    A BILL To amend section 633 of title 28, United States Code, prescribing
                   fees of United States commissioners.

                                    94 

   (a) United States commissioner~ in each judicial district, except national
park commissioners, shall receive the following fees only for all services
rendered, not to exceed $12,500 for anyone calendar year:
         (1) For attending to any reference by order of court of a litigated
     matter in a civil case or in admiralty, $10 a day.
         (2) For taking and certifying depositions, 38 cents for each folio
     and for each copy thereof furnished on request, 25 cents per folio.
         (3) A fee graduated according to the aggregate number of cases in
     each quarterly accounting period, in the sum of $17.50 for each of the
     first twenty-five cases, $11.25 for each of the next twenty-five cases, $10
    for each of the next fifty cases, and $2.50 for each additional case, of
     the following kinds:
        Issuance of an attachment and subsequent hearings in internal rev­
     enue matters pursuant to section 7604 (b) of title 26 ;
        Settling or certifying the nonpayment of a seaman's wage pursuant
    to sections 603 and 604 of title 46 ;
       Preliminary proceedings to hold an accused person to answer in
    district court, payable to the commissioner who disposes of the case by
    discharge or binding over, for all services rendered after presentation
    of the accused;
       Each accused person brought before the commissioner for holding to
    answer in district court shall be considered a case for the purpose of
    computation of fees.
        (4) For aU services rendered for each accused person presented

    tion for a search warrant, whether granted or denied, $7.50.
        (7) For each proceeding for the discharge of an indigent prisoner,
    $7.50.
       (8) (a) For each defendant who appears before the commissioner
    and is tried or sentenced by him for a petty offense, in lieu of all other
                                     95 

       fees provided in this section, a fee graduated according to the aggregate
       number of cases in each quarterly accounting period, in the sum of $20
       for each of the first twenty-five cases and $15 for each additional case.
         (b) For each defendant in a petty offense proceeding allowed to

       a fee of $10 in lieu of all other fees provided in this section.

         JURISDICTION OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS

   H.R. 3094, 87th Congress, would amend 18 U.S.c. 3401 (a) and
 (b) with respect to the trial jurisdiction of the United States
commissioners by inserting in lieu of the term «petty offenses" the
term "an offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than
one year or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or both." The bill
retains the provision that a defendant may elect to be tried before
the district court, but eliminates the present statutory requirement
that he be apprised of his right to a trial in the district court and
sign a written consent to trial before the commissioner. The Con~
ference at its September 1960 session (Conf. Rept., p. 42) ap­
proved a similar bill with an amendment restoring the require~
ment that the United States commissioner apprise the defendant
of his right to elect to be tried before the district court and pro­
hibiting him from proceeding to try the case unless the defendant,
after being so apprised, signs a written consent to be tried before
the commissioner. The Conference reaffinned its approval of the
bill as thus amended.

                       IMMUNITY LEGISLATION

   Various bills to provide for a grant of immunity from criminal
prosecution in certain cases have been introduced in the 87th Con­
gress, including S. 1655, S. 1386, S. 526, and H.R. 1246. The Con­
ference at its September 1960 session (Conf. Rept., p. 42) ap­
proved the proposal contained in S. 1655 which would grant im­
munity from criminal prosecution when upon order of the court a
witness is compelled to testify or to produce evidence before any
grand jury or court of the United States in a prosecution under 18
U.S.C. 1951 with respect to interference with commerce by threats
or violence, or in a prosecution under 29 U.S.C. 196 with respect
                                96 

to the bribery of a labor representative. Upon recommendation           (
of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its approval of these
proposals contained in S.1655.

               MENTALLY INCOMPETENT PRISONERS

   The Attorney General of the United States is presently au­
 thorized by 18 U.S.C. 4248 to transfer a prisoner committed to
 his custody under the authority of Section 4246 or 4247 to the
 proper authorities of the state of his residence. The Conference
 reaffirmed its approval of a proposal to amend 18 U.S.C. 4248 to
 authorize the Attorney General, or his authorized representative,
 to transfer a mentally incompetent prisoner to a hospital or other
 facility with which suitable arrangements have been made for his
.custody and care.

      CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

   S. 1380 and H.R. 5143 would amend Section 801 of the District 

of Columbia Code to provide that "the punishment for murder in 

the first degree shall be death by electrocution unless the jury QY 

unanimous vote recommends life imprisonment." At the present            (
time, the death penalty is mandatory upon a convictjon of murder
in the first degree.
  The Conference at its March 1960 session approved a draft: of
a bill to provide that the penalty for murder in the first degree
shall be life imprisonment "unless the jury unanimously recom­
mends the death penalty." It was. the view of the Committee
that while S. 1380 andH.R. 5143 differ from the previous rec­
ommendation of the Conference, they have the virtue ofcharigiiig
that feature of present District of Columbia law which requires
the imposition of the death penalty in every case' of first degree
murder which results in a conviction. The Conference thereupon
approved the bills;          '.                              .
                  ESCAPE INVOLVING JUVENILES'

   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the proposal con­
tained in n.R. 6524, 87th Congress;which would:amend lKU;S.C.
1073 to provide a lesser punishment for the crime of escape, at­
tempt to escape, or instigating or aiding escape, when the crime is
committed by a person who is under commitment as a juvenile                 L
                                       97 

     delinquent, or by a person who is in custody by virtue of a lawful
     arrest for a violation of any law of the United States, not punish­
     able by death or life imprisonment, committed before such per­
     son's 18th birthday and as to whom the Attorney General has not
     specifically directed the institution of criminal proceedings.
              INTERSTATE COMPACI'S DEALING WITH JUVENILES

          The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the proposals con­
       tained in H.J. Res. 95 and H.J. Res. 283, 87th Congress, which
       would give the consent of Congress to compacts among certain
       states dealing with (a) the supervision by one state of juveniles
       placed on probation or parole by another state, and for detention
       and return of such juveniles; (b) the detention and return of
       runaway juveniles from one state to another; (c) the detention
       and return of juvenile delinquents who are on probation or parole
       and who run away to another state; and (d) the joint rehabilita­
    · tiofl. of juveniles found delinquent in one state and placed in spe­
    .' cialized institutions in another state.
              SETTING ASIDE CONVICTIONS OF YOUTH. OFFENDERS

(       It.R.5343, 87th Congress, would amend the Youth Corrections
    ·Act, 18 U.S.C; 5021, to authorize the court to grant a certificate
     setting aside the conviction of a youth offender placed on proba­
     tion, prior to the expiration of the maximum period of probation.
     This bill embodies a proposal made by the Committee and approved          Ii
                                                                               !;
    ,hy the· Conference in March 1960. The Conference reaffirmed its
     approval of tlleproposal.
                         INSTITUT,E OF CORRECI'IONS
                                                                              I
    · •.. H.J.Res. 9.3,. 87th Congress, would authorize the Attorney Gen­
     eral to. establish, an Institute of Corr.actions for the. training and
     instruction of corrections personnel, selected by states and their
     municipal subdivisions, in the field of correctional methods and
     techniques. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
     ference approved the bill.
                      APPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES
                                                                               I
     . S: 1692,,87th Congress, would provide that a defendant, convicted      I'
    . in,a.dist~ct court of an offense for· which no mandatory sentence
                                98 

is fixed by law, may appeal to the appropriate circuit court on
the ground that the sentence is excessive. A similar proposal was
disapproved by the Conference at its September 1957 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 26). Since that time Congress has broadened the discre­
tion of the district judge in fixing sentences by the enactment of
18 U.S.C. 4208, and has also authorized the convening of sentenc­
ing institutes under 28 U.S.C. 334. It was the view of the Com­
mittee that, in time, these statutes may have the effect of reducing
disparity in sentences. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference thereupon disapproved the bill.
   The Conference, however, expressed its concern over the prob­
lem of disparity of sentences and authorized the Committee to
undertake a full study of the problem.
    TIME SPENT BY DEFENDANTS IN CONFINEMENT PRIOR TO
                           SENTENCING

  The Conference was informed that Public Law 86-691, approved
September 2, 1960, provides for the reduction in the sentence of a
person convicted under a statute requiring the imposition of a
mandatory minimum sentence, for the time spent by such person
in custody awaiting trial for want of bail. The Committee re·          (­
quested and was granted leave to study whether or not credit
should also be given for time spent in jail pending appeal.
                       FUGITIVE FELON ACT

   The Committee reported that it had given consideration to
the proposal contained in S. 525 and H.R. 468 to extend the pro­
visions of 18 U.S.C. 1073 to cover flight to avoid prosecution, or
custody or confinement after conviction, for a crime, or an attempt
to commit a crime, punishable by death or imprisonment for more
than one year. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference approved the bill.
               _MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

   The Conference was informed concerning a number of hills
introduced in the 87th Congress, to strengthen the criminal penal­
ties for the mailing, importing or transporting of obscene matter,
including S. 1195, H.R. 3281, H.R. 327 and H.R. 4233. Each of
these bills includes a provision for a mandatory minimum sen­
tence for either the first or subsequent violations. Upon recom­
                                 99 

mendation of the Committee, the Conference took no position
with regard to the merits of the bills, but disapproved in principle
those provisions requiring the imposition of mandatory minimmn
sentences.
                 PROTECTION OF FEDERAL OFFICERS

   H.R. 3538, 87th Congress, would amend the criminal code to
provide that whoever by force or intimidation prevents or at­
tempts to prevent any person from accepting or holding a federal
office, or attempts to induce by like means any officer of the United
States to leave his place of duty, or attempts to impede such
officer in the discharge of his duties, shall be fined not more than
$5,000 or imprisoned not more than six years, or both. This
legislation was approved by the Conference.

                              PERJURY

  S. 1385, 87th Congress, would amend 18 U.S.C. 1621 to provide
degrees of perjury and the punishment therefor. It was the view
of the Committee that this legislation is not needed at the present
time and the Conference disapproved the bill.

PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO COUNSEL APPOINTED TO REPRESENT
              POOR PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME

   The Conference was informed that a number of bills had been
introduced in the first session of the 87th Congress to provide for
the payment of compensation to counsel appointed to represent
indigent persons accused of crime. The Conference reviewed the
bills and authorized the Committee to consider further the vary­
ing and different provisions of these bills and to report further to
the Conference concerning them. The Conference, however,
disapproved the proposal to authorize grants to legal aid societies
and other organizations providing free legal services to indigent
persons accused of crime in the federal courts.
               PROTECTION OF PROBATION OFFICERS

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, re­
affirmed its approval of the proposal to extend to probation offi­
cers the protection afforded federal officers generally by 18 U.S.C.
                                      100 

111, which makes it a crime to assault, resist, or impede certain
federal officers or employees, and by 18 U.S.C. 1114, relating to the
protection of officers and employees of the United States.

       QUALIFICATION STANDARDS FOR PROBATION OFFICERS

  The Conference referred to the Committee on Supporting Per­
sonnel the proposal to fix mandatory minimum qualification stand­
ards for probation officers.
                    COURT REPORTERS' TRANSCRIPTS

   The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference the
hardship sometimes imposed upon indigent defendants and the
Government when a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C.
2255 is presented to a successor judge and no transcript of the
original trial is on file. At present the statute does not provide
for the furnishing at public expense of the transcript of a criminal
trial for use in a proceeding brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255. The
Conference thereupon approved the following draft of a bill to
amend 28 U.S.C. 753(f) to authorize the furnishing of transcripts                  ( ....
at public expense in actions brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255.
   A BILL To amend section 153(t) ot title 28, United States Code, relating to
          transcripts turnished by court reporters for the district courts.

   States of America: in Oongres8 assembZed, That section 153(f) of title 28 of
   the United States Code is amended to read as follows:

   ceedings to persons allowed to sue, defend, or appeal in forma pauperis

        the appeal is not frivolous (but presents a substantial question). The re­
        porter may require any party requesting a transcript to prepay the esti­
        mated fee in advance except as to transcripts that are to be paid for by the
        United States.

                             PRETRIAL PROGRAM

        The Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure, Chief
     Judge Alfred P. Murrah, reported that the new series of seminars
     of federal judges and trial lawyers, authorized by the Conference
     at its September 1960 session (ConI. Rept., p. 37), was inaugurated
     at the Southwestern Legal Center, Southern Methodist University
     School of Law, Dallas, Texas, on July 10-12, 1961. Thirty federal
     judges and approximately sixty members of the bar, representing
     the twelve states comp<rising the Fifth and Tenth Judicial Circuits,
     were in attendance. Several lawyers attending the seminar have
     since received appointments to the district courts. The seminar
     program, arranged by a special committe under the chairmanship
(	   of Judge Irving R. Kaufman, was entitled "Procedures for Effective
     Judicial Administration." A wide range of topics and problems,
     from the filing of a civil action to its disposition, was discussed.
     The proceedings of the seminar will be published in due course and
     a copy will be made available to every federal judge.
     STATEMENT OF THE ESSENTIALS OF PRETRIAL AND TRIAL PROCEDURE

        The Committee also reported the commencement of its special
     study aimed at the development of a statement of the essentials
     of pretrial and trial procedure which will discuss the role .of the
     court iIi such matters as lawyer preparation, full and fair disclosure
     of relevant facts, discovery,· motions practice, the pretrial con­
     ference, calendar supervision, and trial practice. A detailed tenta­
     tive outline and drafts of certain portions of the statement have
     been prepared and will be considered further by the Committee.
                                  102
                     SEMINAR FOR NEW JUDGES

    In view of the large number of judicial appointments to be made
as the result of the recent Omnibus Judgeship Bill, the Conference
 considered the possibility of conducting a seminar or series of
seminars for newly appointed district judges for the purpose of
acquainting them with the problems of judicial administration 3ris~
ing in the operation of the district courts. I t was the sense of the
Conference that seminar meetings, conducted on a regional basis,
£It which a small group of new district judges could discuss the
problems of judicial administration with experienced trial judges,
would be beneficial to the administration of justice. The seminar
program would cover such matters as fundamental court proce~
dures, techniques of effective judicial administration, jurisdiction,
and substantive problems arising in suits brought under federal
statutes. Insofar as the subject matter permits, the program would
be conducted in the manner of the classic university seminar and
participation would be limited to the new district judges and those
experienced trial judges chosen as panel members or discussion
leaders.
   The Conference was further of the view that this seminar pro~            (.
gram ought to be undertaken by the Committee on Pretrial Proc~
dure which has had unique experience in the conduct of judicial
seminars, and that in conducting these seminars the Pretrial Com~
mittee should be given the responsibility for developing and
promoting effective techniques for the efficient and expeditious
administration of justice in the district courts at all stages of
litigation.
   Accordingly, the Chief Justice was authorized to broaden the
duties of the Pretrial Committee to include the promotion of
administrative techniques for the expenditious and efficient admin~
istration of justice in the district courts, and, if desirable, to recon­
stitute the Committee, to change its name and to enlarge its
membership.
            OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury
System, Chief Judge Harry E. Watkins, informed the Conference
that the report, The Jury System in the Federal Courts, approved
by the Conference at its September 1960 session, had been printed           (~
                                 103

and distributed to every federal judge, clerk of court and jury
commISSIOner. A summary of the replies to a questionnaire ad­
dressed to the clerks of the district courts, compiled by the Institute
of Judicial Administration under the direction of the Committee,
has also been printed in a separate volume, which is in the nature
of an appendix to the original report. This appendix has been
distributed to all judges and clerks of court and both volumes are
being furnished to the newly appointed district judges.
   Chief Judge Watkins further reported that through the office
of the Deputy Attorney General of the United States a copy
of the Committee's report had been distributed to each United
States attorney with the request that he review with the clerk
of court and jury commissioner the section of the report on "Stand­
ards of Selection and Sources of Names of Jurors" and "Quali­
fications and Exemptions of Jurors." The commen ts of the United
States attorneys were made available to the Committee, and where
it was indicated that the procedures of a particular district appear
to be below the standards recommended in the report, the chief
judges of the circuits and the chief judges of the district courts
concerned have been so informed.
                           GRAND JURIES

   A question has been raised by Chief Judge Sylvester J. Ryan,
of the Southern District of New York, as to whether a grand
jury should be continued beyond its specified term, without spe­
cific order of the court. Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the matter was referred to the Committee on the Administration of
the Criminal Law for study and report to the Conference.
                     COST OF THE JURY SYSTEM

  As a result of the program undertaken by the Administrative
Office in the fall of 1959 to improve petit juror utilization in the
district courts, the fees paid to jurors for services rendered dur­
ing the fiscal year 1960 were $316,000 less than the previous
year, even though there was an increase during the year in the
number of trial days. The Committee reported that the savings
achieved in 1960 have continued to 1961, when total jury costs
Were $124,000 less than in the fiscal year 1960.
                                104 


                        ALTERN ATE JURORS

   There was brought to the attention of the Committee an instance
in which a mistrial was declared in a criminal case after more than
five months of trial because of the illness of jurors which reduced
the jury to less than twelve. This occurred even though a full
complement of four alternate jurors, as provided by Rule 24(c),
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, had been selected. Simi­
lar situations have occurred in other cases from time to time. It
was the view of the Committee that the limitations on the num­
ber of alterna.te jurors as provided in Rule 47(b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 24(c) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, should receive careful study in the light
of this experience. The Committee has, therefore, called this
matter to the attention of the Committee on Rules of Practice
and Procedure and the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law.
                           LEGISLATION

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, re­
affirmed its approval of the proposals, relating to the jury system, ("
contained in the following bills pending in the 87th Congress:
        (1) S. 1899, to increase the fees of jury commissioners in
     the United States district courts from $5 to $10 per day.
        (2) S. 1660 and H.R. 5616, to increase the subsistence and
     limit the mileage allowances of grand and petit jurors.
       (3) H.R. 5391, to provide for a jury commission for each
     United States district court.
  The following bills, containing proposals previously disapproved
by the Conference, were again disapproved:
       (1) H.R. 818 and H.R. 1262, to provide that in a civil case
     the number of jurors required to constitute a jury, and the
     number of whom, must agree for a valid verdict, shall be deter­
     mined by the law of the state in which the action is tried.
       (2) H.R. 189, to require a juror to take an oath that he
     does not advocate and is n()t a member otan organization 'that
     advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United
     States by force or violence.


                                                                      (
                                                                      --./
                                                                             )

                INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
             The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Intercircuit
          Assignments, Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported on the processing
          of requests for intercircuit assignments.
             The Committee, in accordance with subdivision III(9) of the
          plan for the assignment of judges, approved by the Conference
          at its March 1960 session, had prepared and distributed to the
          members of the Conference a statement relating to the needs for
          out-of-circuit assistance and to the availability of judges for such
          service. Since its last report, dated February 19, 1961, the Com­
          mittee has recommended favorably on thirteen intercircuit as­
          signments all of which have been approved by the Chief Justice.
          No adverse recommendation has been made. The judgesreceiv­
          ing intercircuit assignments during this period include one cir­
          cuit judge, five district judges, three senior circuit judges, and
          three senior district judges.
             The Committee has undertaken a careful re-evaluation of the
          policies to be applied in connection with intercircuit assignments
        · as the result of the Act of May 19, 1961, creating ten new circuit
(   ,
          judgeships and 63 new district judgeships. It is the view of the
          Committee that the disparity in caseloads which exist among the
          eleven circuits is such that for there to be the desired improvement
         in the expedition of court business, some circuits, at least tem­
        ·porarily, will not be self-sufficient and will require the use of       i
                                                                                 I:
          judgepower from outside the circuit.
                                                                                  I
             Previously the· Committee had called attention to the desir­
        · abilitY of advance planning for intercircuit assignments. The
         Committee suggested that there are and will be many judges who
          will enthusiastically accept. intercircuit assignments, if the plan­
         ning is so coordinated that there is a minimum of interference with
         their duties to their own courts' and a maximum opportunity to
        'render worthwhile service'elsewhere.
           . The report of the Committee was received and approved by the
        "Conference;                                                      :

                   MULTIPLE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURTS
          ~t was brought to the attention of the Conference that the
        Committee of thirteen chief judges of district courts having five
                                106 

or more judgeships, which was authorized by the Conference to (_.. ,
meet and consider the personnel and budgetary requirements of
the large district courts, had transmitted to the appropriate Con­
ference Committees various recommendations which are now being
given careful consideration. The Conference, therefore, directed
that the Committee be discharged with the appreciation of the
Conference.
              USE OF LAND COMMISSIONERS
   Chief Judge Royce H. Savage, on behalf of Judge Stanley N.
Barnes, Chairman of the Committee on the Use of Land Commis­
sioners, presented a comprehensive report on the use of land
commissioners by the United States district courts under Rule
71A(h), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The recommendations
of the Committee concerning the use of land commissioners were
as follows:
         (1) That no change be made in the provisions of Rule
     71A(h).
        (2) That the responsibility for obtaining funds for the
     compensation of commissioners be transferred from the De-         (~.
     partment of Justice to the Administrative Office of the United
     States Courts as quickly as feasible.
         (3) That further study be made of the advisability of
     establishing fixed regional standards for the compensation of
     commissioners.
        (4) That further study be had, looking toward the possible
     preparation of recommended forms, or handbook, or check­
     lists, of suggestions to trial judges which might enable them
     to make use of commissioners in condemnation cases more
     economically and efficiently.
   The Conference considered fully the report and recommenda­
tions of the Committee and directed that the report be accepted
and filed, and that the recommendations contained therein. be
approved, except the recommendation that the responSibility for
obtaining funds for the compensation-of commissioners appointed
in land condemnation cases be transferred from the Department
of Justice to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
The Conference voted to disapprove this proposal at. this time.
