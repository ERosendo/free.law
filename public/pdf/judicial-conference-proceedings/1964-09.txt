                       RESOLUTION
  On the occasion of the retirement of Mr. Will Shafroth
as Deputy Director of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts, the Conference adopted the follow­
ing resolution:
     The Judicial Conference of the United States expresses to
  Will.Shafroth, upon the occasion of his retirement on July 31,
  1964, as Deputy Director of the Administrative Office of the
  United States Courts, its gratitude and appreciation for his
. devoted service to the Federal Judiciary. Mr. Shafroth has been
  with the Administrative Office for almost twenty-five years.
  During this time he has ably assisted the members of the Con­
  ference and the committees of the Conference by his wise coun­
  sel, his patience, his understanding, and his warm personality.
  His sincere dedication to the improvement of the administra­      (
                                        49 

    ({     tion of justice throughout the federal judicial system and his
           loyalty to each of the judges of the federal courts have been
           an inspiration to all. We extend to him our every good wish for
           health and happiness in his retirement and wish him Godspeed.

             HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
            Honorable Emanuel Celler, Chairman of the Committee
         on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, reported
         to the Conference on the increase in the judicial business
)        of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
         the need for additional judicial assistance in that court,
         and the recommendation of the Conference in March 1964
          (Conf. Rept., p. 14) that the circuit be divided. Congress­
         man Celler expressed the view that there should not be a
         division of any circuit until there has been a study in depth
         of the entire circuit system. He called attention to his sug­
         gestion to the Conference in March 1959 (Conf. Rept.,
         p. 4) that the Conference undertake "a survey of the
         geographical organization of the entire federal judicial
         system to be made in the light of popUlation increases and
         economic changes and to include a study of the adequacy
         of the present number of places of holding court." He re­
         quested that this survey and study be completed at an
         early date and stated that if, pending completion of the
         survey, additional circuit judgeships are needed in the
         Fifth Circuit for the efficient dispatch of the judicial busi­
         ness of the court, they should be provided.
                     REPORT OF THE 

         DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE 

              OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS 

            Warren Olney III, Director of the Administrative Office
         of the United States Courts, had previously submitted to
         the members of the Conference his report for the fiscal
         year ending June 30, 1964, in accordance with the pro­
    (L   visions of 28 U.S.C. 604(a) (3). The Conference approved
                            50 


the immediate release of the report for publication and
authorized the Director to revise and supplement the final
printed edition to be issued later.
                STATE OF THE DOCKETS

 Courts of Appeals-Appeals docketed in the United States
 courts of appeals during the fiscal year 1964 were 6,023,
 an increase of 11 percent, as compared with the 5,437
 appeals docketed in 1963. There were 5,700 cases disposed
 of, 689 more than the previous year, but 323 less than
 the number of appeals commenced. As a result, appeals
 pending in the United States courts of appeals on June 30,
 1964, increased to an all-time high of 3,780.
    Reversing the trend of recent years and reflecting the
 additional district judgeships authorized in 1961, the in­
crease in cases docketed in the United States courts of
appeals during the last two years has been the result of
an increase in the number of appeals from decisions of (~'
the district courts. Appeals from all other sources, includ­
ing petitions to review decisions of federal administrative
agencies, have declined.
District Courts-Civil cases pending in the United States
district courts on June 30, 1964, climbed to a record
72,195, an increase of almost 3,000 cases compared with
the 69,219 civil cases pending a year earlier. During the
year there were 66,930 civil actions commenced, an in­
crease of 3,300 as compared with 1963. The 63,954 civil
actions disposed of, although 3,000 less than the number
filed, were an increase of 1,575, or 3 percent, as compared
with 1963.
    The criminal caseload in the district courts did not
increase. During the fiscal year 1964, there were 29,944
criminal cases filed, 29,648 criminal cases were disposed
of, and on June 30, 1964 there were 9,578 criminal cases
pending. Because of the priority given to criminal cases, (~:;
                                  51 


    the criminal dockets of the district courts continue to
    remain current.
       For the eighth consecutive year, bankruptcy cases filed
    reached an all-time high. Total filings were 171,719, an
    increase of 10 percent over 1963. A record 162,356 cases
    were closed during the year, or 20,916 more than last
    year. Nevertheless, filings outstripped terminations by
    9,363 cases and the pending caseload on June 30, 1964, in­
    creased to a new record high of 157,177 cases. Nonbusiness
    bankruptcies continue to account for more than 90 percent
    of all bankruptcy cases filed. During 1964 the filing of
    nonbusiness bankruptcies accelerated at a faster rate than
    business bankruptcies.

       A NEW ApPRAISAL OF THE NEEDS OF THE COURTS

       Mr. Olney suggested to the Conference that the con­
    tinued congestion of the civil dockets in the district courts,
    particularly in the three years that have elapsed since the
(   passage of the Omnibus Judgeship Act of May 19, 1961,
    is a matter requiring renewed attention. The additional
    judgeship positions authorized in 1961 were originally
    recommended by the Conference as "necessary to bring the
    dockets of the courts to a position where the ordinary civil
    case could be tried within six months of filing." Since
    then the backlog of pending civil actions has increased
    more than 13 percent and the time required to reach the
    ordinary civil action for trial has not been reduced.
       Mr. Olney recommended that the Judicial Conference
    undertake immediately (1) a complete survey and study
    of the need for additional judges in the United States
    district courts and courts of appeals; (2) a review of the
    adequacy of the present staff in the offices of clerks of
    court; and (3) an investigation into the problem of con­
    gestion of the dockets of the district courts of the metro­
    politan areas, particularly as regards the disposition of
    the ordinary civil action with particular emphasis on civil
    actions pending for more than three years.
                            52

         SURVEY OF JUDICIAL BUSINESS
   The Conference received reports from the Court of
Claims, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and
from the Chief Judges of the respective circuits concern­
ing the state of the dockets in each circuit and district.
These reports were supplemented by the district judges
who presented additional details concerning the business
of the district courts in their circuits. The reports indi­
cated a continuing increase in the judicial business of
both the courts of appeals and the district courts and a
growing need for additional judgeship positions.
   The Committees on Court Administration and Judicial
Statistics reported to the Conference that they had con­
sidered several suggestions and recommendations for the
creation of additional judgeships and had concluded that
a complete study of the need for additional judgeships
should be undertaken. The Conference thereupon author­
ized the Committees on Court Administration and Judicial
Statistics to consider the judgeship recommendations dis­
                                                              ("
cussed in their reports and the need for the creation of
additional judgeships in other courts, and to prepare an
omnibus judgeship bill for the consideration of the Con­
ference at its March 1965 session.
   The Conference discussed the upward trend in the judi­
cial business of the federal judicial system and the grow­
ing workload of the courts and voted to adopt a policy of
                                                                   j
making a comprehensive report to the Congress approxi­
mately every four years on the need for additional judge­
ships and the recommendations of the Conference with
respect thereto.
            JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief
Judge William J. Campbell, submitted to the Conference
the appropriation estimates for the judiciary (exclusive of
the Supreme Court and the Customs Court) for the fiscal (~/
                                  53 


     year 1966. The estimates, which had been prepared by
     the Director of the Administrative Office pursuant to 28
     U.S.C. 605, and which were examined and approved by
     the Committee, total $84,792,000, an increase of $12,738,­
     500 over the amount appropriated for the fiscal year 1965,
     adjusted to reflect the recently authorized pay increases.
     On recommendation of the Committee, the appropriation
     estimates presented were approved by the Conference.
        The Director of the Administrative Office was further
     authorized to revise the budget estimates for the fiscal
     year 1966, or, in the alternative, to submit to Congress
     estimates of supplemental appropriations for any pur­
     pose which could not be anticipated at the time 01 this
     submission.
        The budget estimates for the fiscal year 1966 include
     funds for 90 additional probation officers and 68 clerk­
     stenographers for probation offices; 33 additional law
     clerks, 33 stenographers and 36 messengers for the courts
(	   of appeals; and funds to make permanent 15 deputy clerk
     positions for the courts of appeals and 25 deputy clerk
     positions for the district courts, which are now provided
     on a temporary basis. Provision is also made for an addi­
     tional clerical position in the Court of Customs and Patent
     Appeals and for the appointment of 12 additional full­
     time referees in bankruptcy and the conversion of 7 part­
     time referee positions to full-time status. The appropria­
     tion request includes a reserve for additional referee posi­
     tions and staff which may be authorized by the Conference
     at the March 1965 and the September 1965 sessions in
     accordance with recommendations of the Bankruptcy
     Committee.
        There is also included in the budget estimates the sum
     of $7,500,000 for the implementation of the Criminal
     Justice Act of 1964, of which $460,000 represents the
     cost of administration. It was the general consensus of
     the Budget Committee and the Ad Hoc Committee ap­
                            54 


pointed to develop rules, procedures and guidelines for an   0
assigned counsel system that this estimate represents the
minimum first year's cost of implementing the Criminal
Justice Act.
   The Conference was informed that the cost of eliminat­
ing the so-called nonmetropolitan category of court re­
porters, as approved by the Conference in September 1963
 (Conf. Rept., p. 105), could be absorbed out of savings
in the funds provided for the implementation of the Judi­
ciary Salary Plan, subject to the approval of the Appro­
priations Committees of the Congress.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Director
of the Administrative Office was authorized to increase
the salaries of referees in bankruptcy and court reporters
retroactive to the first day of the first pay period in July
1964 in the event of the passage of the bill, then under
consideration in Congress, which would authorize such
retroactive salary increases.
   The Committee also requested and was granted author- (
ity to distribute to each chief judge, for his information,
a copy of the annual letter of appeal to the Senate Appro­
priations Committee.
            SUPPLEMENTAL ApPROPRIATIONS

   For the fiscal year 1965 the Congress appropriated to           J
the judiciary, exclusive of the Supreme Court, the sum             '
of $66,360,100. This was $1,906,900 less than the amount           I'
requested but $2,583,600 more than the sum appropriated
for the previous year. The original estimates for salaries         r
and expenses of referees in bankruptcy included reserves           I
for implementation of the anticipated actions of the Judi-         I
cial Conference in March 1964. The House Appropriations
Committee denied the requests and, although the sum of
$114,000 was restored by the Senate, the House version of
the appropriations bill was finally enacted. Requests for
these funds were resubmitted to Congress on September 11,    (~"
                                     55 

    (   1964, and hearings were held before the Senate Appropria­
        tions Committee on September 22. The Senate approved
        the request, but House Conferees would not recede from
        their disagreement on the item.
           The Committee reported that it had considered and ap­
        proved a supplemental appropriation in the amount of
        $6,091,000 to cover the estimated cost of pay increases
        authorized under the Federal Judicial Salary Act of 1964.
        The estimate contemplates that approximately 10 percent
"       of the total cost of salary increases granted to the support­
        ing personnel of the courts, the employees of the Adminis­
        trative Office and the clerks to referees will be absorbed.
        The cost of salary increases authorized for the personnel
        of the special courts and for judges and referees in bank­
        ruptcy cannot -be absorbed. An additional sum will be
        required if the pay increases authorized for referees in
        bankruptcy and court reporters are to be made retroactive.
           The report of the Budget Committee was received and
    (   approved by the Conference.
                     COURT ADMINISTRATION
           The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administra­
        tion, Chief Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the report
        of the Committee.
                          PRETRIAL EXAMINERS

           The Conference at its March 1964 session (Conf. Rept.,
        p. 10) authorized the appointment of a Committee consist­
        ing of two district judges and one circuit judge, to be
        designated by the Committee on Court Administration,
        to examine the administration of the respective pretrial
        examiner systems of the United States District Courts
        for the District of Columbia and for the Southern District
        of New York and to report thereon to the Committee on
        Pretrial Procedure and to the Committee on Court Admin­
    (   istration. In accordance therewith, a Committee consisting
                            56

of Senior Circuit Judge Phillip Forman and Chief Judges
Thomas M. Madden and Theodore Levin made an exami­
nation of and filed a report on the pretrial examiner pro­
gram in each district. The Committee on Court Adminis­
tration concluded, on the basis of this report, that the
budgetary requirements for the continued maintenance of
the pretrial examiner system of the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia are thoroughly war­
ranted and should continue to be appropriated. The Com­
mittee further concluded that the Office of Pretrial
Examiners of the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York should be continued on an
experimental basis, that the appropriation of funds to
sustain the office on its present basis for the fiscal year
1966 is amply justified, and that the appropriation of
funds should be continued from year to year until further
order of the Judicial Conference, pending an investigation
in depth for the purpose of evaluating the pretrial exam­
iner system and related pretrial procedures in the United (
States District Court for the Southern District of New
York by an authority competent to conduct such a study.
The Conference was informed that the Committee on Pre­
trial Procedure concurred in this report. The Conference
thereupon approved the conclusions and recommendations
of the Committee on Court Administration.

             SELECTION OF CHIEF JUDGES

   A bill, S. 1367, 88th Congress, would provide for the
selection of chief judges of United States district courts
and courts of appeals by rotation, establish the terms of
service of chief judges and set forth the powers and re­
sponsibilities of chief judges with respect to the adminis­
tration and superintendence of the business of the circuit
and district courts. While this bill has been considered
from time to time, as have other plans for the selection of ..
chief judges of circuits and of multiple-judge district (
                                  67
(
    courts, the Committee reported that it has been unable to
    arrive at any conclusion as to the best plan for the selection
    of chief judges. Accordingly, the Committee requested and
    was granted leave to consider further the proposals con­
    tained in S. 1367 and any other plans for the selection
    of chief judges and to report at a later session of the
    Conference.
                   PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

       (1) S. 2392, 88th Congress, would add Williston as
    an additional place of holding court for the United States
    District Court for the District of North Dakota. The Con­
    ference in March 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 8) disapproved
    the bill because of the small percentage of cases which
    would be available for trial at Williston. Upon recommen­
    dation of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its
    disapproval of the bill.
       (2) S. 2668 and H. R. 9929, 88th Congress, would add
f   Manchester as a place of holding court in the Winchester
    Division of the United States District Court for the
    Eastern District of Tennessee "on a temporary basis upon
    order of the presiding judge." The Conference was in­
    formed that the proposal contained in these bills had been
    disapproved by the Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit.
    Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
    voted to disapprove the bills.
       (3) H. R. 8561, 88th Congress, would add Clinton as
    an additional place of holding court in the Eastern District
    of North Carolina. This proposal was approved by the
    Conference at its March 1964 session (Conf. Rept., p. 9).
    Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
    reaffirmed its approval of the bill.
       (4) H. R. 7811, 88th Congress, would add Ann Arbor
    as an additional place of holding court for the United
    States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.
    The Conference discussed the proposal contained in the
                              58

bill and referred it to the Judicial Council of the Sixth
Circuit for further consideration in the light of the discus­
sions in the Conference.
                  RETIREMENT OF JUDGES

   The Conference in March 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 9) had
requested the Committee on Court Administration to
undertake a comprehensive survey and study of the prob­
lems arising in the expeditious disposition of the official
business of a United States court (other than the Supreme
Court) where a judicial officer becomes unable to discharge
efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of permanent
mental or physical disability. The Committee was further
requested to undertake a similar comprehensive survey
and study of the problems arising in the administration
of justice in a United States court (other than the Supreme
Court) where a judicial officer is guilty of misbehavior in
office, to review the adequacy of existing statutory and
administrative procedures relating to both of these prob­
lems and to formulate and recommend to the Conference
improvements in these procedures. The Committee re­
ported that the survey and study would be of considerable
difficulty and magnitude and would require additional
time. The Conference, accordingly, granted leave to the
Committee to pursue its investigations further and to
report to the Conference at a future session.
                       CLERKS' FEES

  The Committee reported to the Conference in March
1964 (Conf. Rept. p. 11) that a study and report on the
existing fee schedule for the clerks of court, prepared by
the Administrative Office, had been referred to a subcom­
mittee to consider the extent to which fee schedules should
be commensurate with the services rendered. The subcom­
mittee, however, has not completed its examination of the 'J~!
problem nor made a report. The Committee, therefore, \
                                 59
(
    requested and was granted leave to report at a later ses­
    sion of the Conference.
                  LAW BOOKS FOR NEW JUDGES
       The Committee presented to the Conference a revised
    list of law books to be made available to each newly ap­
    pointed judge where there is available to him a reasonably
    large and well organized central library. It was the view
    of the Committee that the use of this list would reduce to
    some extent the cost of the acquisition of law books. With
    the understanding that the Administrative Office is to ex­
    ercise its judgment and allow flexibility and latitude to
    the end that the law book requirements of a newly ap­
    pointed judge may be satisfied, the Conference approved
    the use of the list of law books submitted by the Committee
    and directed that newly appointed judges who have a
    reasonably large and well organized central library avail­

c   able to them choose law books from among those set out
    in the list.
                 ASSIGNMENT OF SENIOR JUDGES
       The Conference in March 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 13)
    authorized the Committee to consider the policy questions
    involved in granting senior judges indefinite designations
    and assignments to sit in their own districts. Upon recom­
    mendation of the Committee, the Conference concluded
    that senior judges should be designated to sit in their own
    districts for periods not longer than a year at a time by
    each designation, except under exceptional circumstances.
        TAXATION OF ATTORNEYS' FEES IN TAX CASES
       H. R. 10280, 88th Congress, would provide reasonable
    attorney's fees for a taxpayer who has been successful
    in a tax suit against the United States. It was the view
    of the Committee that unless the principle of authorizing
    reasonable counsel fees to successful litigants is to be uni­
    versally applied, there is no reason why the United States
                             60 


should be subjected to such a burden. Upon recommend a-        C·.. . 

tion of the Committee, the Conference disapproved the 

bill. 

            REPORTS OF FINANCIAL STATUS
   H. R. 10703, 88th Congress, would require justices,
judges and every officer and employee of the Judicial and
Executive Branches of the Government receiving more
than $12,620 a year, to file with the Clerk of the House
of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate a writ­
ten statement of every "thing of economic value," includ­
ing a ~'favor," received during the previous fiscal year.
The bill would also require the filing of a written state­
ment with the Attorney General setting forth "every
source of income and every thing of economic value"
received from any individual or organization registered
under the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act. Employees
of the Legislative Branch are not included within the          (~'
provisions of the bill. The Conference expressed the view          _
that it would have no objection to legislation of this kind,
provided that it would be made to apply equally to all
branches of the Federal Government.
                   WIDOWS' ANNUITIES
  H. R. 10391, 88th Congress, would amend the Judicial
Survivors Annuity Act, 28 U.S.C. 376, to authorize pay­
ment of an annuity to a widow who has remarried if "her
remarriage has been terminated by divorce upon her own
application and without fault on her part." Similar bills
have been introduced from time to time and considered
by the Judicial Conference. It was the view of the Com­
mittee that the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act should
not be amended for the benefit of particular individuals
and that the only amendments that should be made are
those which would be of general benefit. Upon the recom­
mendation of the Committee, the Conference voted to dis­
approve H. R. 10391.                                           (~
                                   61
 (       S. 2784, 88th Congress, would authorize the Director
      of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
      to pay an annuity to the widow of Judge J. Frank
      McLaughlin, formerly of the United States District Court
      for the Territory of Hawaii, in an amount equal to the
      annuity she would have been entitled to receive if Judge
      McLaughlin had elected to bring himself within the pur­
      view of 28 U.S.C. 376, and had been in a retired status
      at the time of his death. The Conference was informed
      that Judge McLaughlin's widow is receiving an annuity
•	    under the Civil Service Retirement Act and that Judge
      McLaughlin during his lifetime had failed to file the neces­
      sary election to bring himself within the purview of the
      Judicial Survivors Annuity Act. The Conference ap­
      proved the Committee's recommendation that the bill be
      disapproved.
                        RESIDENCE OF JUDGES

 (	      H. R. 10010, 88th Congress, would require each district
      judge, except in the District of Columbia, to be a resident
      of the district (or one of the districts) to which he is ap­
      pointed at least three years immediately prior to the time
      of his appointment and thereafter while in active service.
      Title 28 U.S.C. §134 (b) presently provides that each
      district judge, except in the District of Columbia, shall
      reside in the district or one of the districts for which he
      is appointed. It was the view of the Committee that the
      proposed amendment, which seems designed to meet un­
      usual situations, is unnecessary and undesirable. Upon
      recommendation of the Committee, the Conference disap­
      proved the bill.
               RETIREMENT OF TERRITORIAL JUDGES
         S. 2912, 88th Congress, would provide that theservice
      of J udge Walter H. Hodge as a judge of the District Court
      for the Territory of Alaska shall be included in computing,
 (	   under Sections 371, 372, and 376, of Title 28, United States
                            62

Code, his aggregate years of judicial service. No provision (j
was contained in the Alaska Statehood Act for counting
service as a territorial judge for the purpose of comput­
ing the total length of service in a United States district
court. The Committees on Court Administration and Revi­
sion of the Laws presented a revised bill to authorize the
inclusion of such service for retirement purposes, which,
upon recommendation of the Committees, was approved by
the Conference.
   DISQUALIFICATION OF A CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR BIAS 

                   AND PREJUDICE 

   The Committees on Court Administration and Revision
of the Laws requested and were granted leave to consider
further the proposals contained in S. 2538, 88th Congress,
to provide for the disqualification of a circuit judge for
bias and prejudice and to report at a future session of the
Conference.
                RETIREMENT OF JUDGES
   The Committees on Court Administration and Revision
of the Laws reported that they had considered the proposed
constitutional amendment contained in H. J. Res. 1121,
88th Congress, to provide that "no person who has attained
the age of seventy years may serve as a judge of any court
of the United States, but any person who ceases to serve
as a judge of such court because he has attained the age
of seventy years shall continue to receive the compensation
to which he was entitled as a judge."
   Upon recommendation of the Committees, the Confer­
ence voted to disapprove H. J. Res. 1121.
          DISBURSEMENT OF JUDICIARY FUNDS
   The Conferenc~ had previously disapproved the inclu­
sion of the Judicial Branch of the Federal Government
within the provisions of H. R. 5171, 88th Congress, which
would give authority to the Administrator of the General
                                63 


    Services Administration "to coordinate and otherwise pro­
    vide for the economic and efficient purchase, lease, main­
    tenance, operation and utilization of electronic data
    processing equipment by Federal departments and agen­
    cies." It was brought to the attention of the Committees
    that an amendment to the bill, which has passed the House
    of Representatives, is contemplated by the Senate Com­
    mittee on Government Operations. Upon recommendation
    of the Committees, the Conference authorized the Director
    of the Administrative Office to state again to the Senate
    Committee on Government Operations the view of the
    Conference that control of substantive administrative pro­
    grams of the Judicial Branch of the Government should
    not be vested in the head of an agency of the Executive
    Branch of the Government.
       RETIREMENT PROVISIONS FOR DIRECTORS OF THE 

                ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF 

               THE UNITED STATES COURTS 

(
       The Conference at its March 1960 session (Conf. Rept.,
    p. 43) considered a retirement program for Directors of
    the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and
    adopted a resolution urging the enactment of legislation
    to establish such a program. The Committees on Court
    Administration and Revision of the Laws were authorized
    to prepare a draft bill in accordance with the previous
    resolution and to report thereon at the next session of the
    Conference.
       ADDITlONAL JUDGESHIPS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
       The Conference considered the large increase in the
    caseload of the United States Court of Appeals for the
    Fifth Circuit and the need for additional judgeship posi­
    tions in that court and voted to recommend that, pending
    consideration in the Congress of the proposal to divide
    the Fifth Circuit, there be created immediately four addi­
    tional judgeships for that court on a temporary basis.

            REVISION OF THE LAWS                              \   I



  Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Com­
mittee on Revision of the Laws, submitted the report of
the Committee.
           AMENDMENT OF THE TUCKER ACT
   The Conference at its March 1964 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 15) authorized the Committees on Court Administration
and Revision of the Laws to consider enlarging the
present $10,000 jurisdictional ceiling on suits brought in
the district courts under the Tucker Act. The Committees,
after full consideration of various proposals, recommended
that the present $10,000 limitation on the jurisdiction of
the district courts of suits against the United States on
contract or compensation claims under the Tucker Act be
increased to $50,000. This recommendation was approved
by the Conference.
         ApPEALS FROM THE HIGH COURTS 
                       () 

              OF AMERICAN SAMOA 

 AND THE TRUST TERRITORY OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 

   The Committees on Court Administration and Revision
of the Laws had considered jointly a draft bill prepared
by the Department of the Interior to provide, for the first
time, for appeals to courts in the federal system from the
High Courts of American Samoa and from the High Court
of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. At present,
there is no appeal to any other court from the decisions
of these courts. The Committees were in accord with the
views of the Department of the Interior that a right to
the review of the decisions of these courts should be pro­
vided, and that the United States District Court for the
District of Hawaii and the District Court of Guam, re­
spectively, are courts which are appropriate, both by rea­
son of location and familiarity with the legal problems
involved, to consider such appeals. It was pointed out,
however, that the draft bill would restrict the right of
                                  65

     appeal from the decisions of the High Court of American
     Samoa in four classes of cases.
        The Committees were of the view that the right of
     appeal from decisions of the High Court of American
     Samoa should be the same as that from the High Court
     of the Trust .Territory of the Pacific Islands. The Com­
     mittees, therefore, recommended that the bill prepared by
     the Department of the Interior be approved with the elimi­
     nation of the restriction on the right of appeal and an
     amendment to the first sentence of the bill to provide: "The
     United States District Court for the District of· Hawaii
     shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decision~
     of the High Court of American Samoa." This recommen~
     dation was approved by the Conference.
           JURISDICTION OF THE DISTRICT OF HAWAll
         H. R. 11182, 88th Congress, would enlarge the judicial
     district of Hawaii to include the Islands of American
(	   Samoa and would give the United States District Court
     for the District of Hawaii appellate jurisdiction to review
     final judgments of the High Court of American Samoa.
     The Committee pointed out that the Islands of American
     Samoa are the only Pacific Islands over which the United
     States has sovereignty but in which no court is vested by
     law with the jurisdiction of a United States district court.
     It. was the view of the Committee that the inhabitants of
     these islands and allY other litigants having claims arising
     therein which would otherwise be cognizable in ~. United
     States district court should have access to such a court for
     the enforcement of their rights. The Committee approved
     the proposal contained in H. R. 11182 but presented a
     revised bill, drafted in the form of an amendment to the
     Judicial Code, Title 28, United States Code, and recom­
     mended that the bill, as revised, be approved by the Confer­
     ence. The recommendation of the Committee was approved
     by the Conference.

           GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DISPUTES 	                       (
  H. R. 10765, 88th Congress, would amend the so-called
Wunderlich Act to provide for the full adjudication of
the rights of Government contractors in courts of law.
The bill would (1) eliminate the present provisions of
that Act which make the decision by the head of any depart­
ment or agency on a dispute arising under a Government
contract "final and conclusive unless the same is fraudu­
lent or capricious or arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as
necessarily to imply bad faith, or is not supported by
substantial evidence" and (2) would authorize a court to
decide the issues in a trial de novo and on the basis of such
evidence as is admissible under the applicable rules of
evidence. The Conference. after full discussion, voted to
disapprove H. R. 10765.
                       LEGISLATION
   The Conference, on recommendation of the Committee,
reaffirmed its approval of the following bills pending in       ()
the 88th Congress which embody proposals heretofore ap­
proved by the Conference:
   (1) 	 H. R. 11101, 88th Congress, to amend 28 U.S.C. 

        2072 with respect to the scope of the Federal Rules 

        of Civil Procedure (Conf. Rept., March 1964, p. 

         22). 

   (2) 	 H. R. 11651, 88th Congress, to provide cost-of­

        living allowances for judicial employees stationed 

         outside the continental United States or in Alaska 

        or Hawaii (Conf. Rept., March 1961, p. 19). 

   The Conference, upon recommendation of the Commit;..
tee, reaffirmed its disapproval of the proposals contained
in the following bills pending in the 88th Congress:
   (1) 	 S. 2842, S. 2873 and H. R. 11061, 88th Congress,
         to confer jurisdiction on the United States district
         courts to hear and render judgment on certain
                                67 


           claims of any officer who is a member of a Reserve
           component of the uniformed services of the United
           States (Conf. Rept., March 1964, p. 18).
      (2) 	H. R. 10169, 88th Congress, to amend the Inter­
           state Commerce Act to make unlawful discrimina­
           tory property tax assessments of common carrier
           property and to confer jurisdiction on the district
           courts to issue injunctions in such cases (Conf.
           Rept., Sept. 1962, p. 21).
                 COURT OF VETERANS' ApPEALS

       S. 2509, H. R. 10272, H. R. 10489, H. R. 11405 and
    H. R. 11855, 88th Congress, would establish a Court of
    Veterans' Appeals and prescribe its jurisdiction and func­
    tions. These bills are substantially the same as H. R. 2162
    and H. R. 3531, 88th Congress, which were considered by
    the Conference at its March 1963 session (Conf. Rept.,
    p. 18) and approved as to the type of review proposed. At
(   that time, however, the Conference was of the view that
    the question whether judicial review of the denial of
    veterans' claims should be accorded is a matter of public
    policy which is solely within the province of Congress to
    decide and that thejudiciary should take no position there­
    on. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
    ence reaffirmed its views with respect to the proposals
    contained in this legislation.
                      RULES OF
               PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
      Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the Stand­
    ing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, report­
    ed that the preliminary drafts of proposed amendments
    to the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure,
    including a proposed unification of the civil and admiralty
    practice, and the preliminary draft of a complete set of
(   Uniform Rules of Federal Appellate Procedure have been
                              68
                                                                  . .-.....
widely circulated to the members of the bench and bar and        ( )
that comments concerning them are being received by the
Committee. Judge Maris informed the Conference that the
Committee expects to have definite proposals to submit to
the Conference atits session in September 1965.
   The Conference was also informed that the bill to author­
ize the promulgation of rules of practice and procedure
underthe Bankruptcy Act had been reported by the Senate
Judiciary Committee and would in al11ikelihood be passed
at this session of the Congress. The Conference thereupon
authorized the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice
and Procedure to proceed with the development of rules
~f practice and procedure for bankruptcy cases in the event
that the bill is enacted into law.
    INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES                       "
   The Chair:r:nan of the Advisory Committee on Intercir­
cuit Assignments, Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, reported
on th~ processing of requests for intercircuit assignmentE\      ()
from February 21, 1964 to August 11, 1964. During this
period the Committee recommended favorably on a total
of 25 assignments. which have been, or will be, undertaken
by 20·judges, three of whom have accepted more than one
assignment. Five assignments were in connection with the
nfl,tional deposition program in the electrical equipment
antitrust cases. The 25 assignments were undertaken by
one active circuit judge, six senior circuit judges, seven
active district judges, five senior district judges and one
senior judge of the CoUrt of Claims .
 . The Committee reported that the condition of the dock­
ets in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit continues
to demand attention. The Committee estimates that the
services of thirty visiting judges, each sitting for one week,
Will be required if the court is to maintain during the fiscal
year 1965 the same schedule of sessions that were held
during 1964. This is a demand that cannot be met through
the services of senior judges. The Committee, therefore,
                                 69
(   renewed its previous recommendation that the "Judicial
    Conference might well consider requesting the chief judges
    of the various circuits to make available all possible help
    to alleviate the situation." This recommendation was ap­
    proved by the Conference.
       It had been suggested to the Committee that the state­
    ment of principles and procedures for intercircuit assign­
    ments adopted by the Conference in March 1963 (Conf.
    Rept., p. 36) be reconsidered. The statement now requires
    that help for a court in need be supplied by an intercircuit
    assignment of an active judge only when help is not avail­
    able from within a circuit or from a senior judge. It was
    proposed that intercircuit assignments be permitted on a
    personal arrangement basis and that the Committee be
    more active in soliciting help for courts in need. The Com­
    mittee reported that it recognizes that the acceptance of
    an intercircuit assignment is voluntary and that personal
    arrangements are often the most effective method of ob­
(   taining judicial help. To this end the Committee has urged
    the chief judges of circuits where courts are in need to call
    on chief judges of other circuits for aid. The policy state­
    ment, in the view of the Committee, does not preclude
    personal arrangements, but only outlines the situations in
    which such arrangements will be approved.
       In its previous reports the Committee called attention
    to the disparity in workloads in the courts and recom­
    mended that judges who were not busy go to the assistance
    of judges whose dockets were crowded. It was pointed out,
    however, that the statutory requirements of certificates
    of need and grants of consent place the control of inter­
    circuit assignments in the hands of the chief judges of
    the circuits. The Committee has concluded, therefore, that
    it may not infringe on the prerogatives of the chief judges
    but it can and will cooperate with them.
       In recommending that no change be made in the state­
    ment of principles and procedures previously approved
(   by the Conference, the Committee pointed out that "every
                             70 


judge is aware that his primary duty is to the particular
court to which he is appointed; he may also contribute
immeasurably to the administration of justice throughout
the Federal judicial system by cooperating with other
courts when, because of need or extraordinary situations,
his services are requested." The report of the Committee,
including a statement relating to the need for intercircuit
assignments and the availability of judges for such service,
was received and approved by the Conference.
                                                                    1!
         BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   Senior Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., Chairman of the
Committee on Bankruptcy Administration, reported that
the Committee had met and considered (1) the recommen­
dations contained in the survey report of the Director of
the Administrative Office, dated June 29, 1964, relating to
the continuance of referee positions to become vacant by
expiration of term, for new referee positions and for
changes in salaries and arrangements for referees and
 (2) the recommendations contained in the survey report
of the Director, dated August 18, 1964, relating to in­
creases in the salaries of full-time and part-time referees
in bankruptcy in accordance with the Federal Judicial
Salary Act of 1964, Public Law 88-426, approved August
14,1964. This Act increased the maximum annual salaries
that may be fixed by the Judicial Conference to $22,500
for full-time referees in bankruptcy and to $11,000 for
part-time referees. The Committee also considered the               'r


recommendations of the district judges and of the judicial
councils of the circuits concerned. The Conference con­
sidered fully the Committee's report and the recommenda­
tions of the Director, the judicial councils and the district
judges.
   On the basis of these reports and recommendations the
Conference took the action, shown in Table I, relating to
salary increases, changes in salaries, and the creation of      l
                                71 


    new referee positions. The Conference directed that, ex­
    cept for referees whose salary increases must be deferred
    under the provisions of Section 40 (b) of the Bankruptcy
    Act, 11 U.S.C. 68 (b), all salary increases for referees
    authorized under Public Law 88-426 be effective as of
    July 1, 1964, or as soon thereafter as may be permitted by
    law; and that all other changes in salaries, unless other­
    wise noted, become effective October 1, 1964, or as soon
    thereafter as appropriated funds are available.

                                LEGISLATION
   The Committee submitted to the Conference a proposal
to amend Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act to give the
court supervisory power over all fees paid from any source.
                               80

A similar provision is now contained in Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act, Section 221 (4), 11 U.S.C. 621 (4). Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
proved the following draft bill and authorized its introduc­
tion in the Congress:
                            A BILL
    To amend Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act to give the
  court supervisory power over all fees paid from whatever
  source
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
  the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
  Section 366 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 766) is amended
  by adding a new clause to read as follows:
   "(5) All payments made or promised by the debtor or
    by a corporation acquiring property under the arrange­
    ment, or by any other person, for services and for actual
    and necessary expenses in, or in connection with, the pro­
    ceeding or in connection with the arrangement and inci­
    dent thereto, have been fully disclosed to the court and     (
    are reasonable."

             AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   The Conference was informed that the examination of
statistical reports of closed bankruptcy cases for the deter­
mination of errors in the computation of amounts due the
Referees' Salary and Expense Fund and all overpayments
of compensation to receivers and trustees is continuing.
The Committee has received no report of any situation
with respect to the accountability of a referee for admini­
strative errors in the computation of compensation of
receivers and trustees or in the computation of amounts
due the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund which required
action on the part of the Committee. The statistical forms
submitted to the Administrative Office have been amended
to include information as to whether trustees were elected
by creditors or appointed by the referee. The Committee
expects that information obtained from these reports will        (j
                             81 


disclose the monopoly of appointments in any district
where such monopoly may exist.
   The Committee had received a resolution of the National
Bankruptcy Conference relating to practices in certain
courts which are believed to conflict with the free election
of trustees by creditors. The National Bankruptcy Confer­
ence has asked that steps be taken to bring the practices in
these courts into conformity with the practices in other
districts. The Committee has requested the Administrative
Office to undertake a study and to report to the Committee
at its next meeting.
             MATTERS UNDER ADVISEMENT

   The Committee reported that in accordance with the
direction of the Conference at its September 1963 session
 (Conf. Rept., p. 89), quarterly reports of matters held
under advisement for more than sixty days are being made
to the district court, with copies to the Administrative
Office. These reports show marked improvement, but a few
referees seem to be making little progress in reducing the
number of matters held under submission sixty days or
longer. The Committee has requested the Administrative
Office to change the form of these reports to require a
statement of the reasons for delay in deciding these cases
and has authorized the Administrative Office to communi­
cate with the district judges where the reasons for delay
do not appear to be adequate.
    DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER            XIII
   The Conference was informed of a continuing increase
in the use of wage earners' plans under Chapter XIII of
the Bankruptcy Act. During the fiscal year 1964 there
were 27,292 Chapter XIII cases filed in the district courts,
an increase of 12 percent over the 24,329 cases filed during
1963. The Committee reported that generally the bank­
ruptcy courts are complying with the guidelines for Chap­
                             82

ter XIII administration promulgated by the Conference          ("1
at its September 1963 session (Conf. Rept., p. 87).
             DEBTORS' COUNSELING SERVICE

   The Conference was informed that the "Debtors' Coun­
seling Service" procedure instituted in the Western
District of Wisconsin is still under consideration by the
Judicial Council of the Seventh Circuit which is giving the
matter extended consideration. With modifications pres­
ently in force in the administration of the Debtors' Coun­
seling Service, the Council has decided to take no action at
present but will re-examine the matter later in the year.

      SEMINAR FOR NEWLY ApPOINTED REFEREES

   Judge Hamlin informed the Conference that the first
seminar for newly appointed referees in bankruptcy was
held in Washington, D. C., on March 23-27, 1964, with          (;-",,1
49 referees appointed since July 1, 1961 in attendance.               ,
Eight experienced referees, three newly appointed referees
and the Honorable Edwin L. Covey, former Chief of the
Bankruptcy Division, served as discussion leaders. The
seminar was highly successful, and the Committee has
expressed its appreciation to the Seminar Committee and
to Honorable Asa S. Herzog, Referee in Bankruptcy in the
Southern District of New York, who served as Chairman
of the Committee. A second seminar for referees in bank­
ruptcy to be held under the auspices of the Committee is
scheduled to be held at Washington, D. C., during the week
of March 29, 1965.
ApPOINTMENT OF A PART-TIME REFEREE AS TRUSTEE 

          IN A CHAPTER X PROCEEDING 


  Judge Hamlin informed the Conference that in one
district a part-time referee in bankruptcy had been ap­
pointed to serve as a trustee in a Chapter X proceeding. It    (
                               83 


was the view of the Committee that while Section 39b of
the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 67 (b), does not prohibit
such appointments, as a matter of policy and good practice
they should not be made. The Conference approved the
proposal of the Committee that the last sentence of Section
39b of the Bankruptcy Act be amended to read as follows:
  Active part-time referees and referees receiving benefits
  under paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 40 of this
  Act shall not practice as counselor attorney or act as trustee
  in any proceeding under this Act.

            REPORTING IN REFEREES' OFFICES

   The Conference was informed that 17 electronic court
reporting units have been installed in 15 referees' court­
rooms and that the operation of these units has proven
successful. Eight additional units have been installed on a
trial basis in seven offices and will be retained if the ref­
erees are satisfied that they satisfactorily meet the require­
ments of their courts.

                COSTS OF ADMINISTRATION

   The Committee reported that detailed statistical tables
analyzing the costs of administration in bankruptcy cases
closed during the fiscal year 1963, which were prepared by
the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office, have
been supplied to all United States judges and referees in
bankruptcy. The Conference was informed that a number
of the larger courts in the country are taking steps to
reduce costs in the administration of asset cases. During
the fiscal year 1963, costs of administration reached 26.4
percent of assets realized. This is a matter of continuing
concern to the Committee and to the Conference and the
Administrative Office will continue its efforts to bring
about a further reduction in these costs.

   The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 90) authorized the Committee to consider further
the proposal contained in S. 447, 88th Congress, to provide
that a person acquitted of a crime against the United
States solely on the ground of his insanity may be confined,
at the direction of the trial court, to an institution desig­
nated by the Attorney General upon a determination, after
hearing, that he was insane at the time of his acquittal.
The members of the Committee agreed with the apparent
intent and purpose of the bill but entertained serious ques­
tions as to its constitutionality.
   A study by the Committee disclosed that the laws of 46       (
states contain provisions for the commitment of persons
acquitted of crime solely on the grounds of insanity and
that in the majority of these states the usual residency re­
quirement for admissioR to a state institution is not appli­
cable. The Committee was of the view, therefore, that a
procedure might be developed whereby the district court
would be required, upon the acquittal of an accused person
solely on the ground of insanity, and upon a determination
that he was insane at the time of acquittal, to so certify to
the designated local official, who, under local law, is re­
quired to institute insanity proceedings in the state court.
The Committee requested and was granted leave to con­
sider the proposed legislation further and to consult with
the sponsor of the hill.
  PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION IN CRIMINAL CASES
  S. 1802, 88th Congress, would make it unlawful for an
employee of the United States, or for any defendant or his      (_
                                       85 


    attorney or the agent of either, to publish information not
    already properly filed with the court, which might affect
    the' outcome of any pending criminal litigation, except
    evidence that has already been admitted at the trial. The
    proposed legislation would make such pUblication a con­
    tempt of court, punishable summarily by the court on
    motion of any party to the litigation by a fine of not less
    than.$500 for each such pUblication. It was the view of.the
    Committee that certain ,provisions in the bill (1) authoriz­
    ing punishment summarily for misbehavior not committed
    in the presence of the court, (2) limiting the usual author­
    i,ty.o~ the court by providing that the,prosecution proceed
    only on mption of a party and (3) limiting the discretion­
    ary authority of the co:urt to impose a penalty appropriate
    to the particular facts and circumstances by "a firte of not
    less than $500 for each publication", were objectionable.
    The Committee, therefore, proposed that the bill be
    amended to read as follows:                    .
     "It shall c.onstittite'a ~.ontempt.of c.ourt f.or any empl.oyee.of the. 

        Uriited States, .or f.or any defendant .or his attorney .or the 

     . agent .of either, to furnish .or make available f.or publicati.on 

       inf.ormati.on n.ot- already pr.operly filed with the c.ourt which 

       might affect the .outc.ome ..of any pending criminal litigati.on, 

       excepteviderice that h~u3 already ,been admitted at the trial.. 

        Such c.ontemptshall be punished by a fine .of n.ot niore than 

      $l~OQ"           .      ,
      Uporirecomrnendation of the Committee, the Conference
    approved the amended b i l l . '               .
                    PRESENCE OF THE DEFENDANT
                     AT THE TIME OF SENTENCE
      . At the request of Judge Smith, the Conference author­
    ized the Committee to give further consideration to the
    proposal contained in S. 1956 and H. R. 7912, 88th Con­
    gress, which would amend 18 U.S.C. 4208 (b) and (c) to
    provide that whelfa defendant is committed to the custody
(   of the Attorney General' for observation and study, the
                             86

defendant need not be present in court when the report is       ( .
received and action is taken as to any affirmation or modi­
fication of the original sentence, but that in the discretion
of the court he may be returned for such proceedings as
may be deemed desirable.

           ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCES

   S. 823, 88th Congress, would provide for the appellate
review of any sentence to a term of imprisonment in ex­
cess of five years on the ground that the sentence, although
within lawful limits, is excessive. The bill would empower
the appellate court to reduce the sentence imposed "if it
determines that the conviction was proper, but that the
sentence imposed was more severe than warranted by the
circumstances of the case."
   The Conference in March 1962 (Conf. Rept., p. 22) had
directed that the proposal contained in a similar bill,
S. 2879, 87th Congress, be made available for discussion        (
at circuit conferences. Pursuant to this direction, the ap­
pellate review of sentences was made the subject of panel
discussions at annual Judicial Conferences in the Second,
Third and Fifth Circuits, at each of which two or more
members of the Criminal Law Committee were in attend­
ance. The judges in the Second and Third Circuits over­
whelmingly favored some method of reviewing sentences;
the judges in the Fifth Circuit did not favor the appellate
review of sentences. The subject was also discussed at
Judicial Conferences in both the District of Columbia
Circuit and the Ninth Circuit.
   The Committee reported favorably on the proposed legis­
lation, but recommended that the bill be amended to em­
power the appellate courts to increase, as well as decrease,
the original sentence. The Conference discussed the pro­
posal fully and voted to recommend the approval of S. 823
with the modification suggested by the Committee.               L

                     DENIAL OF BAIL

   H. R. 42 and H. R. 10156, 88th Congress, would grant
authority to the district courts to deny bail in certain
criminal cases involving national security. The proposal
contained in H. R. 42 had previously been considered by the
Conference (Conf. Rept., Sept. 1963, p. 89) and had been
referred to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules and
to the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal
Law for study and report to the Conference. H. R. 10156
is similar to H. R. 42, but does not contain any provision
authorizing the denial of bail in a misdemeanor case.
   The Committee pointed out that since the passage of the
Judiciary Act of 1789 the federal courts have uniformly
held that the right to bail prior to conviction is absolute,
except where the offense is punishable by death, Stack v.
Boyle, 342 U.S. 1. The Committee also pointed out that the
proposed legislation runs counter to established provisions
relating to bail and is inconsistent with other pending
legislation designed to liberalize the provisions with re­
spect to bail. Upon the recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference voted to disapprove the bills.

                    RELEASE ON BAIL

   S. 2838 and S. 2840, 88th Congress, would provide for
the release of an impecunious defendant on his own recog­
nizance, or otherwise, in lieu of furnishing a bail bond. It
was brought to the attention of the Conference that at
present the procedure with respect to bail is governed by
Rule 46, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and that the
proposals contained in these bills might be embodied in an
amendment to Rule 46. The Conference, accordingly, re­
quested that the Committee consider whether in view of
the existing rule-making power there is a need for legisla­
tion and whether the proposals contained in these bills
might appropriately be brought to the attention of the
                             88 


Advisory Committee on the Rules of Criminal Procedure
for its consideration.
                                                                r
            JURY TRIAL OF CONTEMPT CASES

. S. 2722, 88th Congress, would provide that "In any
prosecution for criminal contempt in the courts of the
United States, the accused shall upon request be accorded
a trial by jury." The Conference discussed the proposal and
referred the bill to the Committee for further study. Chief
Judge Tuttle did not participate in the consideration of
this proposal.

             RIGHTS OF THE MENTALLY ILL

   H. R. 8370, 88th Congress, would amend Chapter 313 of
Title 18, United States Code, with respect to the constitu­
tionaJ rights of mentally incompetent persons committed
thereunder. The proposed amendments to 18 U.S.C. 4244,
contained in the bill, would (1) require that a preliminary     ('
motion for a judicial determination of the mental compe­
tency of the accused to stand trial be supported by a sworn
written statement based on personal observation by a re­
sponsible adult as to the mental condition of the accused;
 (2) require a hearing on the preliminary motion at which
the accused and his attorney should be present; (3) author­
ize a psychiatric examination or temporary commitment
for such examination only upon an initial determination by
the .court "that there is reasonable cause to.doubt the
mental competency of the accused"; (4) limit the commit­
ment, if commitment is ordered, for a "reasonable period,
not to exceed thirty days, as the court may determine" ; and
(5) require a further hearing on the issue of mental
competency to stand trial if the initial report of the physi­
cian "indicates a state of present mental incompetency."
A new provision, to be set forth in Section 4250 of Title 18,
would guarantee to an accused found mentally incom­
petent and committed pursuant to the provisions of the          ;(~
                             89 


statute the right to a periodic re-examination, not more
frequently than every six months, on the application of
his attorney, legal guardian, spouse, parent or nearest
adult relative. The report of the examination would be
forwarded to interested parties other than the accused, and
would be given to the accused only if the committing court
deemed it in his best interests.
   The Committee saw no objection to the procedural steps
outlined in the bill, but recommended a modification to
authorize the temporary commitment of the accused "for a
reasonable period of time, not to exceed thirty days, unless
the court for good cause shown shall extend the period for
an additional time, not to exceed an additional thirty
days."
   The Committee also noted that 18 U.S.C. 4244 now em­
powers the court to order an inquiry into the mental compe­
tency of a person released on probation at any time "prior
to the expiration of the period of probation." This provi­
sion has been omitted in the proposed amendment of Sec­
tion 4244 and the Committee was of the view that it should
be retained. On the recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference approved H. R. 8370 with the modifications
suggested by the Committee.
                     RIGHT OF TRIAL

   S. 1801, 88th Congress, is a bill to effectuate a provision
of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution
requiring that a defendant in a criminal case be given the
right to a speedy trial. The proposals contained in the bill
were considered by the Conference and referred to the
Committee for further study and report at a later session.
                STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

   The Bureau of the Budget had requested the views of
the Conference on a draft bill prepared by the Department
of the Army which would amend 18 U.S.C. 3287 to provide
                             90 


for the suspension of the statute of limitations on certain     r
offenses during periods of "national emergency," formally
declared by Congress or the President, as well as during
time of war. The Conference in September 1963 (Conf.
Rept., p. 92) referred the proposal to the Committee for
further consideration of the meaning of the term "national
emergency." Upon examination, the Committee found
many statutes which authorize the President to declare a
"national emergency" in certain situations and to take
such action as may be necessary to alleviate the conditions
attendant upon the emergencies. It was the view of the
Committee that these emergencies are not such as to re­
quire the suspension of the applicable statute of limita­
tions. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
ence voted to disapprove the draft bill.
TIME SPENT BY DEFENDANTS IN CONFINEMENT PRIOR
                TO SENTENCING

   S. 2839, 88th Congress, would amend 18 U.S.C. 3568 to
assure that all persons convicted of offenses against the
United States will receive credit toward service of their
sentences for time spent in custody for lack of bail. The
right to credit under existing law extends only to those
cases in which the defendant has been sentenced to a mand­
atory term of imprisonment. Upon recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference approved the bill.
        ApPEALS FROM INDIAN TRIBAL COURTS

   A series of bills introduced in the 88th Congress, S. 3041
to S. 3048, inclusive, are designed to protect the rights of
American Indians. One of these bills would provide for a
right of appeal from an Indian Tribal Court to the United
States district court and a trial de novo in the district
court. The Committee was authorized to undertake a study
of these proposals and to report at a later session of the      (
Conference.                                                     '­

         CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964
  Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman of the Ad Hoc
Committee appointed to Develop Rules, Procedures and
Guidelines for an Assigned Counsel System, submitted a
comprehensive report which detailed the legislative history
of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, P.L. 88-455, and
made the following recommendations for implementing the
new Act:
  1. 	 That the Conference approve in principle using a sys­

      tem of central disbursement of funds appropriated to 

      carry out the Criminal Justice Act requiring notifica­

      tion to the Administrative Office of every appointment 

      as it is made, the submission of vouchers to the Admini­

      strative Office for payment containing adequate infor­ 

      mation as to the nature and extent of services rendered, 

      both in and out of court, and the expenses incurred, 

      with payment directly from the Administrative Office 

      rather than locally. 

 2. 	 That the Conference approve in principle the admini­

      stration of the Criminal Justice Act through a frame­ 

      work of boards of advisers to the judicial councils of 

      the circuits, assisted by full-time, compensated officers. 

 3. 	 That the Conference request the chief judge of each 

      circuit to call a meeting as soon as practical of the chief 

      judges of the district courts in his circuit to consider 

      the problems of the administration of the Criminal 

      Justice Act, the urgency of developing practical and 

      acceptable plans in each district, ways and means of 

      stimulating the interest and securing the support and 

      cooperation of the bar in every district in the imple­

      mentation of the Criminal Justice Act, and to make 

      plans for again convening to act as a panel of judges 

      to appoint from the bar an appropriate Board of 

      Advisers to the Judicial Council. 

 4. 	 That the Conference recommend to the Chief Justice 

      that a special session of the Judicial Conference of the 

      United States be convened at a date as early in January 

      1965 as possible for the exclusive purpose of consider­

      ing the problems of administration under the Criminal 

      Justice Act. 

                                92 


  5. 	 That the Conference authorize the Chief Justice to
       supersede the Ad Hoc Committee with a larger Com­
                                                                  n
       mittee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act with·
       some district judges included in its membership.
  6. 	 That the Conference approve the budget estimates to 

       be developed with the Budget Committee for adminis­ 

       tering the Criminal Justice Act according to the above 

       described principles and plan. 

  7. That the Ad Hoc Committee be discharged.
   Chief Judge Hastings emphasized the need for prompt
action if the district courts are to formulate plans within
six months, have them approved by the Judicial Councils
of the Circuits within nine months, and place them in oper­
ation within one year, as required by the Act. After full
consideration, the Conference approved the report of the
Committee and the recommendations contained therein,
and authorized the immediate distribution of the report to
all United States circuit and district judges.
                 ADMINISTRATION                                   0
            OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  Chief Judge Thomas M. Madden, on behalf of Judge
Luther W. Youngdahl, Chairman of the Committee on the
Administration of the Probation System, presented the
report of the Committee to the Conference.
                  SENTENCING INSTITUTES

  Chief Judge Madden submitted to the Conference a
proposal for a regional sentencing institute for judges in
the Ninth and Tenth Circuits to be held October 19-22,
1964, at Lompoc, California. The Conference was advised
that the program submitted was in accordance with the
requirements of the statute, 28 U.S.C. §334. The Confer­
ence thereupon authorized the convening of the sentencing
institute· at Lompoc, California, in accordance with the
plan ana program presented by the Committee.        .
                             93 


   The Conference also authorized the issuance of an invi­
tation to Professor J. Ll. J. Edwards, Director of the
Centre of Criminology at the University of Toronto, to
attend the Institute on Sentencing at Lompoc.
   Chief Judge Madden also submitted to the Conference a
plan and program for a sentencing institute for the judges
of the Third Circuit to be held at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania,
November 11-13, 1964. Approximately thirty active dis­
trict judges of the Third Circuit and such circuit judges
as may be able to attend will be invited to participate. The
institute is to be conducted under the supervision of the
Committee on the Administration of the Probation System
in cooperation with the Committee on Sentencing of the
Third Circuit. The Conference thereupon authorized the
convening of the Institute on Sentencing at Lewisburg in
accordance with the plan and program presented.
   The Conference was informed that circuit committees
on sentencing institutes and seminars have been appointed
in eight circuits and that appointments of committees in
the remaining three circuits are anticipated in the near
future.

         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER
   The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 96) approved, in principle, the proposal for a
research and development center in the correctional field
and authorized the Committee to work toward its estab­
lishment. A meeting, authorized by the Conference in
March 1964, to consider and discuss the basic assumptions
underlying the administration of probation and parole, to
devise and recommend possible experiments, to test the
validity of these assumptions and to consider a program
of practical and useful research, was held at the National
Institute of Mental Health in July 1964. The conferees
at this meeting adopted the following resolution which,
                                 94 


upon the recommendation of the Committee, was approved
by the Conference:
                                                                      r
 "Statistics on post release criminality of convicted offenders
  receiving different types of sentences are essential to supply
  guidelines to judges, parole boards, and all others charged
  with making decisions relating to the disposition of federal
  offenders.
 "There has been no systematic knowledge developed to date of
  the relative success of the different forms of treatment.
 "At present the fingerprint identification files maintained by
  the FBI contain the only national record of further crimin­
  ality. These record the date and charge of most fingerprint
  arrests reported to the agency and, less frequently, informa­
  tion as to the disposition of the person arrested.
 "This conference unanimously agrees in calling on the courts
  and all agencies concerned to report to the FBI more com­
  pletely on arrests and particularly on the disposition of of­
  fenders in all felony cases. The participants propose to work
  diligently for this in their own jurisdictions.
 "This conference further unanimously urges that the FBI
  provide the Administrative Office of the United States Courts       ( .
  with current criminal identification records ("rap sheets") on
  all federal offenders released for a period of five years follow­
  ing release. This will permit the compilation by the Admini­
  strative Office of statistical guidelines which judges, parole
  boards, and other decision makers find essential."

                    PRESENTENCE REPORTS
   Chief Judge Madden informed the Conference that a
Subcommittee on Presentence Reports and Supervision
has developed a draft of a uniform presentence report out­
line and format to serve jointly the needs of the courts, the
Bureau of Prisons, and the Board of Parole. The document
is under consideration by the Committee and a report will
be made to the Conference at its next session.
                   GROUP COUNSELING
              IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

   The Conference at its March 1964 session {Conf. Rept., (l'
p. 33) authorized the Committee to seek funds for a study .
                                95 


    of the group counseling program in the probation office of
    the United States District Court for the District of Colum­
    bia with the understanding that if nongovernmental funds
    are sought, the Conference must approve the source of the
    funds. The Committee reported that federal funds are
    available and that a study should be initiated in the near
    future. A further report will be made at the next session
    of the Conference.
      COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF EXISTING PROBATION AND
                   PAROLE RECORDS
       The Conference at its March 1964 session (Conf. Rept.,
    p.34) granted authority to the Committee to seek funds
    for a retrospective study of probation and parole records
    in the United States District Courts for the Western
    District of Missouri and the Northern District of Illinois
    to determine whether the effectiveness of sentencing pro­
    cedures can be analyzed. The Committee reported that the
(   cost of this study can be made from operating funds in the
    Administrative Office and the Department of Justice and
    that the study will be inaugurated in the near future. A
    further report will be made at the next session of the
    Conference.
                     DEFERRED PROSECUTION
      The Committee reported that it has undertaken a review
    of the practice of deferring the prosecution of certain
    juveniles who are then placed under the supervision of the
    probation officers of the United States district courts and
    has requested the Administrative Office to make a study of
    the nature, purpose and extent of the current practice of
    deferred prosecution.
            PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO RULE 32(c)
           FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
      Chief Judge Madden informed the Conference that a
    survey of district judges to determine their opinion of the
                             96 


proposal to amend Rule 32 (c), Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, was in progress and that the results will be
                                                               r
reported to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules.
The proposed amendment of Rule 32 (c) would require the
court, on request, to afford counsel for the defendant an
opportunity to read the presentence report and to com­
ment thereon.
           ACCESS TO INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS

   The Committee had reported to the Conference at its
last session reports had been received that the work of
probation officers is being impeded by the refusal of the
Department of Justice to permit probation officers to ex­
amine investigative reports relating to the facts of the
offense in the files of the United States attorneys. While
the Committee has been assured that the Department has
no intention of impeding unnecessarily the work of the
probation officers, the problem is unresolved. A further       (1,
report will be made to the Conference at its next session.       J
             SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
   The Chairman of the Committee on Supporting Person­
nel, Chief Judge Theodore Levin, submitted the report
of the Committee to the Conference.
                    COURT REPORTERS

   The Federal Judicial Salary Act of 1964, Public Law
88-426, approved August 14, 1964, increased the statutory
limitation on the salaries of court reporters from $8,690
to $8,945 per annum. Upon recommendation of the Com­
mittee the Conference directed that the salaries of court
reporters be increased to the extent permitted under the
salary increase Act, and that the increases be made retro­
active to the first pay period commencing after July 1,
1964, in the event of the passage of legislation authorizing
such action.
                              97 


   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
separated the combined position of court reporter­
secretary in the District of New Mexico and one such posi­
tion in the District of Idaho and authorized the appoint­
ment of a court reporter in each district at the salary rate
applicable to reporters in the present metropolitan cate­
gory as approved by the Conference in September 1963
 (Conf. Rept., p. 105).
   The Chief Judge of the United States District Court for
the Northern District of New York had requested authori­
zation for a third permanent court reporter for the district
in view of the continued judicial service of Senior Judge
Stephen W. Brennan. Temporary court reporter assist­
ance is now authorized for Judge Brennan by the Admin­
istrative Office. The Committee was of the view that
the system of authorizing temporary reporters may pre­
sent problems relating to their recruitment and retention
and, accordingly, has requested the Administrative Office
to undertake a study of the feasibility of providing regular
court reporters for those senior judges remaining active,
who continue to render substantial judicial service to the
district courts. Upon the Committee's recommendation,
the Conference directed that the request for an additional
permanent court reporter position in the Northern District
of New York be denied pending completion of the Commit­
tee's study. It was understood that the Administrative
Office would continue to supply temporary court reporter
assistance to Judge Brennan.

                       LAW CLERKS

   The Committee had received a report that the existing
salary scale for law clerks is creating difficulties in one
court in the recruitment of new law clerks, particularly
those with high scholastic ratings. The Committee re­
ported, however, that judges generally seem to have no
particular difficulty in recruiting law clerks, that the pres­
                             98 


ent salaries authorized for law clerks are adequate, and '(' 

that no changes in salary classifications should be made.
This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
                      COURT CRIERS
   The Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit had rec­
ommended a reclassification of court criers from grade
JSP-5 to grade JSP-6. A similar suggestion had been made
by Chief Judge Willis W. Ritter of the District of Utah.
It was the view of the Committee that the present classifi­
cation for court criers is appropriate, particularly in view
of the action of the Conference three years ago in reclassi­
fying court criers from Grade 4 to Grade 5 and that no
reclassification should be made. The Conference agreed
with the views of the Committee.
            NATIONAL PARK COMMISSIONERS
  Chief Judge Levin informed the Conference that the
Administrative Office had undertaken a questionnaire sur­
vey of the volume of work handled by National Park
commissioners.
                   PROBATION OFFICERS
   The Chief of the Probation Division of the Administra­
tive Office had brought to the attention of the Committee
the urgent need for ninety additional probation officers
for the probation system. This is the minimum number of
additional positions that are required to bring the person­
nel strength of the probation service to the point where
careful attention can be given to all persons under super­
vision and comprehensive presentence investigations can
be provided for the district courts in all cases where they
are needed and requested. To provide adequate clerical
service for these additional probation officers, sixty-eight
clerk-stenographer positions will also be needed. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference If           '.~,
                                                                  .
                                  99 


    approved the additional probation officer and clerk­
    stenographer positions requested and directed that the
    funds for these positions be included in the appropriation
    requests.

                         CLERKS' OFFICES

       The Administrative Office has received many requests
    from clerks' offices, both in the courts of appeals and in the
    district courts, for additional personnel. Temporary help
    has been provided within the limits of available funds and
    currently there are fourteen temporary positions author­
    ized for the clerks' offices of the courts of appeals and
    twenty-five temporary positions in clerks' offices of the
    district courts. In recognition of the need for additional
    help in the clerks' offices, the Committee recommended that
    wherever possible, the temporary positions currently au­
    thorized be converted to a permanent basis, but that this
c   be accomplished, if feasible, without requesting additional
    funds from the Congress. The recommendation of the
    Committee was approved by the Conference.
            QUALIFICATIONS FOR CLERKS OF COURT

       The Conference was informed that the Committee had
    considered the desirability of prescribing qualification
    standards for clerks of court and had requested the Ad­
    ministrative Office to undertake a study and prepare a
    report for submission to the Committee.
                   ADDITIONAL STENOGRAPHERS
                  FOR THE COURTS OF ApPEALS

       The Committee had considered requests for additional
    stenographic assistance in the United States courts of
    appeals and had concluded that the present stenographic
    assistance available to some of the particularly burdened
    courts of appeals was inadequate for these courts to carry
C   out their responsibilities efficiently and economically. The
                             100

Committee, therefore, recommended that each court of             ("1
appeals be authorized to employ not to exceed three stenog­
raphers, to be assigned from time to time by the chief
judge to judges or to such matters as he may deem desir­
able to expedite the work of the court. This recommenda­
tion was approved by the Conference.
                        SECRETARIES

   The Judicial Council of the District of Columbia Circuit
adopted a resolution requesting the creation of two new
salary classifications for secretaries to judges that would
be above the maximum grade now authorized. A similar
recommendation had been made by Chief Judge Chambers
of the Ninth Circuit. The Committee reported that this
matter is under consideration and will be given further
study by the Committee.

             CLERKS OF COURTS OF ApPEALS

   The chief judges of the Courts of Appeals for the Second
Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit suggested a
separate salary classification for clerks of each of the large
size United States courts of appeals. The Committee re­
ported that it had considered the proposal and was of the
view that it would be extremely difficult to devise reason­
able standards of classification for the clerks of the courts
of appeals which would accurately and fairly recognize
differences in the positions that would be necessary to
justify a difference in salary level.
             SALARllS OF CLERKS OF COURT

   In accordance with the provisions of the salary increase
Act of 1964 granting discretion in the fixing of salaries of
ungraded positions in the Judicial Branch of the Govern­
ment, the Director of the Administrative Office authorized
increases in the salaries of clerks of courts of appeals and
district courts in accordance with a plan which would re-        (e
                             101 


establish the relative rates of pay of clerks of court, on the
one hand, with rates of pay authorized for judges, referees
in bankruptcy and deputy clerks, as existed when the
clerks of court were placed in ungraded positions by the
Judicial Conference in 1957. The Conference was informed
that the Committee unanimously approved the salary
classification schedule for clerks of court established by
the Director and placed in operation by him in accordance
with the salary increase Act of 1964. The Conference con­
curred in the Committee's approval.

  ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FOR THE CLERK'S OFFICE 

            OF THE COURT OF ApPEALS 

      FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT 


   Chief Judge David L. Bazelon of the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit requested authority
to employ two additional deputy clerks and two stenog­
raphers for the clerk's office of the court of appeals. The
request is based on an increase in the routine business of
the clerk's office and the need for an "indigency clerk"
whose duties would be partly to arrange for and coordinate
the large number of assignments of counsel to represent
indigent defendants in criminal cases in various courts
in the District of Columbia. The Committee concluded that
action on the request for an "indigency clerk" ought to
await the development of the plan of representation for
the District of Columbia authorized and required by the
Criminal Justice Act of 1964. The Committee indicated,
however, that a subcommittee has been appointed to con­
sider the matter and that the Committee would recon­
sider the request in the event an additional deputy clerk
is necessary to make the plan effective. The Committee
further concluded that the request for additional assist­
ance to meet the increase in the routine business of the
clerk's office was not justified in comparison with the
workload in other offices of clerks of courts of appeals.
                           102

Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
disapproved the request for additional positions:
                                                           rr
               JUDICIAL STATISTICS
  The Chairman of the Committee on Judicial Statistics,
Chief Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, presented the report of
the Committee.
                  COURTS OF ApPEALS

   Chief Judge Johnsen informed the Conference that the
Miscellaneous Record System recommended by the Com­
mittee and approved by the Conference at its March 1964
session (Conf. Rept., p. 28) has been put into effect in the
offices of the clerks of the courts of appeals and appears to
be operating without significant difficulty. The purpose of
this system is to secure uniformity in the clerks' offices of
the courts of appeals as to making a record and furnishing
reports of the increasing number of miscellaneous applica- 1['
tions, not already docketed, on which the courts of appeals " _
                                                              1

or the judges thereof are called upon to act.
     SUSPENSE DOCKET IN THE DISTRICT COURTS

   The Committee had received a suggestion that there be
created a "Suspense Docket" in the United States district
courts on which would be placed criminal cases involving
fugitive, incarcerated and mentally incompetent defend­
ants and civil cases which, for reasons not controllable by
the court, are unable to be reached for trial in the normal
order. A subcommittee appointed to consider the sugges­
tion reported that a great majority of the district judges
responding to a questionnaire expressed themselves as not
seeing any need for and not favoring such a docket. It was
the unanimous view of the Committee that no helpful
statistical purpose can be served by the creation of such a
special docket and that the present required practice of
reporting such cases and having them shown as cases pend- (("
                                      103 


          ing on the court's general docket should be adhered to. The
          Committee has suggested to the Administrative Office,
          however, that an appropriate indication of the number of
          fugitive, incarceration and mental-incompetence cases
          pending might be added to the general statistical portrayal
          of pending criminal cases.
                                  JAIL 	LISTS

             The Committee considered a proposal that each district
          court make periodic reports to the Administrative Office of
          all federal prisoners in confinement and awaiting trial in
          the district so as to focus attention on any prisoners held
          for lengthy periods before trial. The Committee was of the
          view that this is a matter that could sufficiently be en­
          trusted to the responsibility and control of the individual
          district courts, that there was no present need for such
          statistical routine and burden, and that there was, there­
(    ,	   fore, no occasion for the Committee to take any action on
          the proposal.
                    ApPLICATIONS IN FORMA PAUPERIS

             Chief Judge Johnsen informed the Conference that the
          practice in a number of clerks' offices of treating motions
          filed under 28 U.S.C., §2255, as incidents in the criminal
          case and not docketing them as civil proceedings, in accord­
          ance with the previous Conference resolution (Conf. Rept.,
          Sept. 1962, p. 76 and March 1964, p. 40) seems in some
          measure to be continuing. The Committee has requested
          the Administrative Office once again to direct the clerks to
          treat such motions as civil proceedings and not simply to
          make entry of them in the criminal docket.
             The Committee reiterated its views that as a matter of
          more deliberate judicial examination and consideration
          occurring and as a matter of a desirable record for statis­
          tical history, pauper petitions by prisoners ought not ordi­
(	        narily to be summarily returned, but ought to be per­
                           104

mitted to be docketed and acted upon in relation to their ;(-'
frivolousness.
   The Committee has also suggested that the annual re­
port of the Director of the Administrative Office show
specifically the number of state prisoner habeas corpus
petitions which are being filed in increasing number in the
various district courts.
              DISPOSITION OF CIVIL CASES
             PENDING OVER THREE YEARS

   Chief Judge Johnsen reported that the Committee con­
tinues to have concern about civil cases pending in the
district courts for more than three years. The Administra­
                                                                    I
tive Office has been requested to continue to make special
reference to these cases and to emphasize them.
   The report of the Committee was received and approved
by the Conference.
              PRETRIAL PROCEDURE                             ( ;
  The Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Procedure,
Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, presented the report to the
Committee.
   HANDBOOK FOR EFFECTIVE PRETRIAL PROCEDURE

   Chief Judge Murrah submitted to the Conference a
Handbook jor Effective Pretrial Procedure, which was
prepared by a subcommittee consisting of Circuit Judge
Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman, and Chief Judges Joe E.
Estes and William E. Steckler, and approved by the Com­
mittee at its last meeting. The material for the Handbook
was developed principally through presentations and dis­
cussions at various seminar sessions conducted by the
Committee during the last four years, including the semi­
nars for newly appointed United States district judges.
The Conference received the Handbook and adopted the
following recommendations of the Committee:                  (l '
                                     105 


       1. 	 That the Handbook be accepted and approved by the
            Judicial Conference as a Conference document.
       2. 	 That the Director of the Administrative Office be in­
            structed to arrange for the printing of the Handbook,
            with the printing format and any last minute editorial
            changes to be approved by the subcommittee under
            whose direction the document was prepared.
       3. 	 That a copy of the Handbook, together with the resolu­
            tion of the Conference approving it, be supplied to each
            United States judge and to the Chairmen of the Judici­
            ary Committees of the Senate and the House' of
            Representatives.
       4. 	 That the Administrative Office arrange to have the
            Handbook made available to the legal profession
            generally.

                       AMENDMENT OF RULE            16
        A subcommittee of the Pretrial Committee had under­
     taken a study of Rule 16, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
(	   and had filed a detailed report pointing out the desirability
     of the present general language in Rule 16 and the lack of
     any expressed desire among the judges of the district
     courts for any general revision. It was the sense of the
     Committee, acting upon the report of the subcommittee,
     that Rule 16, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, should not,
     at this time, be amended. The views of the Committee will
     be brought to the attention of the Advisory Committee on
     the Rules of Civil Procedure.
            PRETRIAL PROCEDURE IN CRIMINAL CASES
        Chief Judge Murrah informed the Conference that a
     subcommittee on Pretrial Procedure in Criminal Cases,
     had considered the proposed amendment to Rule 16, Fed­
     eral Rules of Criminal Procedure; Discovery and Inspec­
     tion, and the proposed new Rule 17.1 authorizing pretrial
     conferences in criminal cases. The suggestions of the sub­
     committee will be brought to the attention of the Advisory
     Committee on Criminal Rules.
                            106

   The Committee also pointed out that district judges
throughout the country, without the benefit of a pretrial
                                                              n
rule for criminal cases, have extensively conducted pre­
trials and fostered discovery in criminal cases. It was the
view of the Committee that the experience of district
judges with regard to pretrial procedure and discovery in
criminal cases, together with any forms, orders, stipula­
tions and techniques developed, should be compiled. Ac­
cordingly, the Committee has undertaken through the               t
member of the Pretrial Committee in each circuit" to sub-         ~
mit to every district judge that portion of the subcommit-        .,I
                                                                  U
tee's report on "Recommended Procedures in Criminal               I
Pretrials" and to request his comments and suggestions
about it.
       SUBCOMMITTEE FOR MULTIPLE LITIGATION

   The subcommittee of the Pretrial Committee appointed
to consider discovery problems arising in multiple litiga-    0
tion with common witnesses and exhibits has continued to
concentrate its efforts on the national coordination pro­
gram for the private antitrust electrical equipment cases.
The trial of the first case was concluded this spring, the
national discovery program in six separate product lines
has been substantially completed, additional cases have
been settled, and several more cases have been scheduled
for trial.
   The Committee recommended that a proposal to add a
new subsection (e) to Section 1404 of Title 28, United
States Code, to authorize the transfer of "numerous re­
lated civil actions pending in different districts to any
district for the purpose of pretrial proceedings," which
was developed by the subcommittee, be approved in princi­
ple. The Conference expresed recognition of the need for
statutory change and authorized the subcommittee to con­
tinue to work toward the development of this proposal.     (()
                                                                  'I

                                                                  !

                SEMINAR FOR NEW DISTRICT JUDGES

       Following a review of the content, form and method of
     presentation of seminars for newly appointed United
     States district judges previously held, the Committee has
     concluded that it would be desirable to revise the general
     format of the seminar program and to include additional
     experienced judges as discussion leaders. A subcommittee
     has been appointed to formulate plans for a new seminar
     program and to organize a seminar for new judges at an
     early date. The Committee was authorized by the Confer­
     ence to conduct another seminar for newly appointed
     United States district judges during 1965.
                 PRETRIAL IN HABEAS CORPUS CASES

        Judge James M. Carter, a member of the Pretrial Com­
     mittee, has developed a procedure to curtail excessive ap­
     plications by federal prisoners brought under 28 U.S.C.
(. 	 §2255. The Committee reported that Judge Carter's tech­
     nique, published in 34 F.R.D. 391, has been widely adopted
     among the district judges. In view of the interest in Judge
     Carter's technique, Chief Judge Murrah requested that
     the article appearing in Federal Rules Decisions be
     brought to the attention of every district judge.
                           HABEAS CORPUS
        Senior Judge Orie L. Phillips, Chairman of the Commit­
     tee on Habeas Corpus, presented to the Conference a pro­
     posal to amend 28 U.S.C. Section 2241 by inserting therein
     an additional subsection to provide as follows:
      " (d) 	 Where an application for a writ of habeas corpus
             is made by a person in custody under the judgment
             and sentence of a state court of a state which con­
             tains two or more federal judicial districts, the appli­
             cation may be filed in the district court for the dis­
             trict wherein such person is in custody or in the
(            district court for the district within which the state
                               108

      court was held which convicted and sentenced him          (
      and each of such district courts shall have concurrent
      jurisdiction to entertain the application. The district
      court for the district wherein such an application is
      filed in the exercise of its discretion and in further­
      ance of justice may transfer the application to the
      other district court for hearing and determination."
   Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Confer­
ence approved the proposed amendment to 28 U.S.C. §2241
and directed that it be transmitted to the Congress with a
recommendation that it be enacted into law.
   The Conference also considered the problem arising in
a habeas corpus proceeding where a person convicted of a
crime in a state court is confined in a federal institution
on a contract basis, but is being held in a state other than
the state of conviction. After full discussion, the Confer­
ence directed the Committee on Habeas Corpus to study
this problem and report to the next regular session of the
Judicial Conference.
   The Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 108) approved a bill to amend Chapter 153 of
Title 28, United States Code, with reference to applica­
tions for writs of habeas corpus by persons in custody
pursuant to the judgment of a state court. The provisions
of the bill recommended by the Conference are contained
in H. R. 1835, 88th Congress, as reported by the House
Judiciary Committee, except for one change in language
made by the Judiciary Committee. The bill was passed by
the House of Representatives on June 23, 1964. Upon rec­
ommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved
H. R. 1835, as amended by the House Judiciary Committee
and passed by the House.

            RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
