 The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief Judge

                                     3

    held in February by the Subcommittee of the House Appropriations
    Committee on the Judiciary Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 1968.
    Judge Campbell advised that he was accompanied at the hearings
    by Chief Judge Lumbard and Chief Judge Tuttle who addressed
    remarks to the committee on the need for additional law clerks
    for judges of the courts of appeals and by Judge Edward A. Tamm
    of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia who spoke to
    the committee on the need for a coordinator or administrator to
    implement the Criminal Justice Act, particularly in the District of
    Columbia.
    SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON CONTINUING EDUCATION,
       RESEARCH, TRAINING AND ADMINISTRATION
       Mr. Justice Stanley Reed, Chairman, presented the report of the
    Special Commitee on Continuing Education, Research, Training
    and Administration.
       In reviewing with the Conference the reasons for the establish­
    ment of the Special Commitee, Mr. Justice Reed pointed out that
    over the last ten years the Conference through its standing com­
    mittees has engaged in an increasing number of programs and
    projects, some in the nature of continuing education and training
    and some in the nature of research, each under the oversight of
    one or another of its committees, and all designed and intended
    to meet some pressing need for improvement in federal judicial
    administration. In addition, the Confernece has expressed itself
    as favoring numerous other programs and projects which have not
    been undertaken because of the lack of staff, funds and Congres­
    sional authority. In September 1966 there were no less than 24
    existing or suggested programs or projects of the Conference, each
    under the supervision of one or another of its standing committees
    and all in the nature of continuing education, training or research,
    looking toward improvement in federal judicial administration. It
    was because of this situation that the Conference at its September
    1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 37) approved a resolution authorizing
    the establishment of the Special Committee to study the possible
    need for Congressional authorization for a broad program of con­
    tinuing education, research, training and administration.
       Mr. Justice Reed stated that the Committee had held several
    meetings and that it had communicated with all federal judges
(
                                        4

who had attended seminars for newly appointed judges, all referees
in bankruptcy and all chief probation officers, soliciting their views
as to the value of the training programs which had heretofore been
offered under the sponsorship of the Conference. He stated that the
judges, referees and chief probation officers were nearly unanimous
in their views that programs heretofore offered should not only be
continued but should be improved and expanded in the future.
He stated that the Special Committee had reached the following
conclusions which it recommended to the Conference:
  (1) 	The establishment of a Federal Judicial Center in the judicial branch 

       of the government is desirable to attain the dispensation of justice in the 

       federal courts with maximum effectiveness and minimum waste; 

  (2) 	The attainment of this objective will be aided by a thorough scientific 

       studY of the methods of judicl:al admini&tmtion and by programs of 

       continuing education of judges and training of court personnel; and 

  (3) 	The activities of the Federal Judicial Genter should be under the direction 
       {
      and control of an autonomous board composed of the Ghief Justice, the 

       Director of the Administrative Office and five judges (two circuit judges 
         I
      and three district judges) elooted by the Judicial Conference. The Ghief
      of the Federal Judicial Genter must be responsible to the board and not
                                                                                            iI
      to the Director of the Administrative Office.
  After considering these conclusions, the Conferenc.e voted its
                                                                                            I

Committee providing for the establishment of a Federal Judicial
Center as recommended.
  The Conference noted that the President in a message to the
Congress on February 6, 1967 had urged the establishment of a
Federal Judicial Center and that bills had been introduced in the
Senate and in the House of Representatives to carry out this
recommendation (S. 915, H.R. 5385, H.R. 6111, H.R. 7215, H.R.
6944). The Conference noted that while the bill drafted by the
Special Committee which the Conference endorsed and the bills
previously introduced were in agreement on the concept of the
Federal Judicial Center, the Conference bill differed in certain
important details. The bill approved by the Conference reads:
                                    A BILL

     To provide f;)r the establishment of a Federal Judicial Genter.

                     JUDICIAL STATISTICS                                           (
  Senior Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman, presented the re­
port of the Committee on Judicial Statistics.

                         CoURTS OF ApPEALS

   Judge Johnsen advised the Conference that pursuant to its au­
thorization at the September 1965 session (Conf. Rept., p. 47) the
Committee had undertaken a comprehensive study of the workload
of the courts of appeals and was prepared to recommend additional
judgeships. Judge Johnsen stated that it had retained as consultant
Mr. Will Shafroth, former Deputy Director of the Administrative
Office, who undertook the task of making a field survey of all the
courts of appeals and that the Committee's conclusions and rec­
ommendations were based on the analysis prepared by Mr.
Shafroth.
   Judge Johnsen pointed out that in the last five years the number
of appeals has increased almost 70 percent. While the number of
terminations per judgeship has also materially risen during the
period from fiscal 1960 to fiscal 1966 (55 per judgeship in 1960 to (
                                           9


    76 per judgeship in 1966), there has been no time since 1960 when
    the number of terminations has succeeded in keeping pace with
    the number of filings. As a result, the number of pending cases
    has increased from a backlog of 2,220 in 1960 to 5,387 in 1966, an
    increase of 140 percent.
      Pursuant to the recommendations of the Committee, and of the
    Committee on Court Administration as set out hereinafter, the
    Conference agreed to recommend to the Congress the establish­
    ment of the following additional circuit judgeships:
     (1) 	 One permanent judgeship to be added to the Court of Appeals for the
          Third Circuit, making the total number of judges for that court nine.
          This recommendation accords with the conclusions of the Judicial Coun­
          cil of the Circuit and the data in the Shafroth report which disclosed
          that during the first half of fiscal 1967 the numberof appeals filed was
          29 percent greater than those filed during the corresponding period of
          fiscal 1966 and that during fiscal 1966 the court had used outside judge­
          power to carry 20 percent of its hearing load.
     (2) 	The four temporary judgeships created for the Court of Appeals for the
          Fifth Circuit by the 1966 Judgeship Act to be made permanent and that
          there should be added thereto two permanent judgeships, making the
          number of judges for that court fifteen. This accords with the recom­
          mendations of the Judicial Council of the Circuit and the Shafroth report
          which disclosed that the filings in the Fifth Circuit have progressively
          increased from 577 in fiscal 1960 to 1,041 in fiscal 1966 and 546 for the
(         first half of fisc·aI1967. The pending case backlog has mounted from 279 in
          1960 to 1,004 in 1966, whereas during fiscal 1966 the court was actually
          using an average of fourteen judges.
     (3) 	 Four permanent judgeships for the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir­
          cuit, making the total number of judges for that court thirteen. This court
          has been operating for a number of years with the help of outside judge­
          power. During the past two years the amount of this judgepower has been
          between 19 and 20 percent of the court's hearing load. Its filings have in­
          creased from about 450 in 1960 to some 800 in 1966 and the volume of
          pending cases or backlog has mounted from 399 to 807. The Conference
          noted not only the increase in caseload but also the enormous growth of
          the geographical area involved, industrially as well as generally, and
          the fact that by 1970 the court can be expected to have a filing load cor­
          respondent to that of the Fifth Circuit during the last fiscal year.
     (4) 	 One permanent judgeship to be added to the Court of Appeals for the
          Tenth Circuit, making the total number of judges for that circuit seven.
          This accords with the views of the Judicial Council of the Circuit. The
          filings per judgeship in this court are substantially more than the na­
          tional average and since 1961 the court has been operating with outside
          judgepower handling more than 10 percent of the hearing load. While
          terminations after hearing and submission have increased from 179 in
          1960 to 359 in 1966, the number of filings has progressively risen from
          229 in 1960 to 543 in 1966.

                         DISTRICT CoURTS

   Judge Johnsen reported to the Conference that several requests
have been received for additional judgeships in certain districts.
The Committee was of the view that the policy established by the
Judicial Conference in connection with the recommendations
which became part of the 1966 Judgeship Act should continue,
namely, that recommendations for additional judgeships should
be predicated on absolute demonstrable present need, with the
elimination of such situations as were marginal or would involve
a measure of projection even though there could be no doubt as to
an ultimate future need. Judge Johnsen reported that the Com·
mittee made a canvass of the situation in all districts and found no
emergency situation which had to be faced before such time as the
Committee's next over-all survey of district judge needs is made.
The Conference agreed with the Committee's conclusion that in
the absence of a pressing emergency situation, no recommendation
for district judgeships at the present time was in order.
  Judge Johnsen pointed out, however, a special situation which
has occurred in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for which
the 1966 Omnibus Act provided three temporary judgeships. With (
the elevation to the Circuit Court of Appeals of District Judge
Francis L. Van Dusen, one temporary judgeship lapsed without an
appointment ever having been made thereto. The Conference
noted that S. 828 has been introduced in the 90th Congress to
reinstitute this temporary judgeship and voted its approval of this
legislation.
                             FORM J.S. 10

   Judge Johnsen referred to the Conference action at its Septem­
ber 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 35) directing the Committee to
make a continuing study of Form J.s. 10 and of the data which
must be furnished in this form to obtain a realistic reflection of the
judicial workloads. Judge Johnsen stated that the Committee was
still studying this form and he requested and was given Confer­
ence permission for further study and a report to the next session
of the Conference.

                      COURT ADMINISTRATION
      The Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration,
    Senior Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the Committee's report.

                        PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

        The Conference withheld a decision on H.R. 838, 90th Congress,
     which would provide for the holding of court at Hyattsville, Mary­
     land. The Conference was informed that the judges of the District
     Court for the District of Maryland have been considering an ad­
     ditional place of holding court and, accordingly, the Conference
     deferred decision until agreement could be reached as to the place
     of holding court and the provision of adequate facilities. Two
     similar bills in the 89th Congress, H.R. 15742 and H.R. 15981,
     were disapproved by the Conference at its September 1966 session
     (Conf. Rept., p. 36).
       The Conference took no action, pending receipt of the views of
     the Judicial Council of the Seventh Circuit, on H.R. 187, 90th
     Congress, which would provide that Rockford, Illinois, be con­
    stituted as an additional place of holding court in the Western
(   Division of the Northern District of Illinois.
       The Conference took no action, pending receipt of the views of
    the Judicial Council of the Third Circuit, on H.R. 4265, 90th
    Congress, which would provide that court be held at Reading in
    the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
       The Conference approved H.R. 2393, 90th Congress, which
    would create a new division in the Western District of Texas to
    be known as the Midland-Odessa Division comprising the coun­
    ties of Andrews, Crane, Ector, Martin, Midland and Upton with
    Odessa as an additional place of holding court. The Conference
    approved a similar bill at its September 1966 session (Conf. Rept.,
    p.36).
       The Conference disapproved H.R. 1156, 90th Congress, which
    would include Denton County, Texas, within the Fort Worth
    Division of the Northern District of Texas. The Conference noted
    that the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit had previously dis­
    approved a similar bill.

                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

   Judge Biggs reported that the Committee on Court Adminis­
tration had considered the requests for additional judgeships in
the courts of appeals and concurred in the views expressed by
the Committee on Judicial Statistics except with regard to the
recommendation as to the Fifth Circuit. As to this circuit, the
Committee on Court Administration agreed that the four tempo­
rary judgeships should be made permanent but was of the view
that the two additional permanent judgeships, approved by the
Committee on Judicial Statistics, are not warranted. The                    \
Chairman expressed his dissent to this conclusion.                          I'
   Judge Biggs reported that the Committee had considered re­
quests and bills for additional district judgeships, as follows: (1)
two additional pennanent judgeships for the Western District                /'
of Pennsylvania; (2) S. 656 and R.R. 3568, to create one addi­              i
tional permanent judgeship for the Eastern District of Kentucky;
(3) a request for two additional judgeships in the Eastern District
of Michigan and (4) R.R. 1445, to create an additional judgeship
for the Southern District of California. The Committee recom­
mended and the Conference agreed to defer consideration of these
bills pending further data and study.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee's recommendation
to approve S. 828, 90th Congress, a bill which would recreate a
vacancy in the United States District Court for the Eastern Dis­
trict of Pennsylvania. The bill would reinstate the vacancy caused
by the elevation of one district court judge in the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania to the Court of Appeals.
                MATTERS RELATING TO JUDGES

   The Conference considered several bills relating to judges and
voted its disapproval of each as follows:
   (a) S. 3579, 89th Congress, which would have provided for a
seven-member commission to be appointed by the President to
ascertain the qualifications of proposed appointees to offices as
justices or judges of the United States and to make recommenda­
tions to the President. The Conference noted that a substantially
similar bill, differing only slightly from S. 3579, 89th Congress, in
respect to the membership of the commission, has been introduced
into the 90th Congress as S. 949.                                       )
                                       13
        (b) H.J. Res. 32, 90th Congress, which would provide a Con­
     stitutional amendment that judges of the Supreme Court hold
     office for twelve-year terms.
        (c) S.J. Res. 38, 90th Congress, which would amend the Consti­
     tution to constitute a "Court of the Union" composed of the chief
     justioes of the highest courts of the states with the sole issue to be
     decided by the court to be whether or not "power or jurisdiction
     sought to be exercised on the part of the United States is a power
     granted to it under the Constitution."
        Cd) H.J. Res. 104, 90th Congress, a Constitutional amendment
     to provide for the popular election of justices of the Supreme
     Court.
        (e) H.J. Res. 243, 90th Congress, which would amend the
     Constitution to provide tha,t Congress shall have power, by two­
     thirds vote of each House, to limit the authority of the courts of
     the United States to determine that statutes of the United States
     or of the states are unconstitutional.
        (f) H.R. 146, 90th Congress, which would amend the Constitu­
     tion to require five years prior judicial service for eligibility for
     appointment to the Supreme Court. A substantially similar pro­
(	   posal was disapproved by the Conference at its March 1965
     session (Conf. Rept., p. 9),
        (g) S. 949, 90th Congress, which would provide for a Judicial
     Service Commission.
        (h) H.R. 2805, 90th Congress, which would provide for the dis­
     qualification of circuit judges for bias and prejudice by amending
     Section 47(a) of Title 28, United States Code. Similar bills were
     disapproved by the Conference at its March 1965 session (Conf.
     Rept., p. 7) and at its September 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p.41).
        (i) H.R. 4236, 90th Congress, which would provide certain
     eligibility qualifications for an appointee to the Supreme Court.
        (j) S. 415, 90th Congress, which would include the service as a
     judge of the Circuit Court of the Territory of Hawaii of Chief
     Judge Martin Pence, now a United States District Court Judge,
     in computation of his service as a United States district judge. The
     Conference disapproved a similar bill at its March 1965 session
     (Conf. Rept., p. 8) on the ground that service as a judge of the
     Circuit Court of the former Territory of Hawaii was the equiva­
     lent of service in a state court and, therefore, should not be included
     in computing years of service as a district judge.
                                  14 

  The Conference approved H.R. 2515, 90th Congress, which
would provide an increase in the salaries of the Chief Justice of
the United States and of the Associate Justices of the Supreme
Court in the amount of $3,000, to be effective as of January 1, 1967.
A substantially similar bill, S. 610, 89th Congress, was approved
by the Conference at its March 1965 session (Conf. Rept., p. 10).

                        JUDICIAL DISABILITY

  The Conference next considered a resolution of the Ninth Cir­
cuit Conference concerning the subject of judicial disability. The
Conference requested the Committee on Court Administration to
continue to study this problem for a later report to the Conference.
                 EXAMINATION OF CoURT OFFICES

   Judge Biggs reported to the Conference that the Committee had
made an exhaustive study of the recommendation of Chief Judge
Roy W. Harper that examination of court offices be placed under
the jurisdiction of the Administrative Office (Conf. Rept., Sep­
tember 1966 Session, p. 37). He reported that this matter had been
before the Conference on at least three occasions-in 1940, 1941
and again in 1944. He pointed out that the examinations made by
the Department of Justice include examinations of the marshals'
offices as well as those of the clerks of court and referees in bank­
ruptcy, He said it was the view of the Committee that it was
desirable to have examinations of court offices made by examiners
outside the judicial system so that courts will not be examining
their own offices or officers and that if any indication of substantial
criminal misconduct appears, it is then the duty of the Department
of Justice to conduct prosecution in which event the Department
would have to make its own examination. It was the Committee's
view alro that to place the examination of court offices under the
Administrative Office w9uld develop unnecessary friction since
the Administrative Office was created and is geared toward servic­
ing the judicial system. The Conference agreed with the recom­
mendations of the Committee and disapproved the proposal to
transfer the examination service from the Department of Justice
to the Administrative Office.

                   JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY FUND

       The Conference received a report from Judge Biggs on the status
    of the Judicial Survivors Annuity Fund and a study of the feasi­
    bility of a merger with the Civil Service Retirement Fund. Upon
    study of this problem the Conference agreed that the Judicial
    Survivors Annuity Fund should not be merged with the Civil
    Service Retirement Fund at the present time but that the Con­
    ference now call to the attention of the Congress the fact that
    the Judicial Survivors Annuity Fund will be exhausted in about
    the year 1984 and that prior to that time, on an occasion the
    Conference shall deem appropriate, action shall be taken by the
    Congress to fulfill the obligations of the United States as provided
    in Section 376 of Title 28, United States Code.
      The Conference also authorized the Committee on Court
    Administration to prepare a revision of the Judicial Survivors
    Annuity Act to bring it into line with the Civil Service Retirement
    Act, in particular to the provisions relating to members of Congress.
                        COURTROOM PHOTOGRAPHS

(     Judge Biggs advised the Conference that the Judicial Conference
    of the Ninth Circuit at its 1966 meeting had suggested that the
    Advisory Committee on Criminal and Civil Rules of the Judicial
    Conference elaborate on the resolution adopted by the Judicial
    Conference of the United States at its March 1962 session (Conf.
    Rept., p. 10) to provide that the district courts by local rule or
    order shall define the area included as the environs of the court­
    room. The Conference agreed that its resolution of March 1962
    should in no way be altered but agreed that the resolution of the
    Ninth Circuit Conference, as wa.s apparently intended by that
    Conference, should be referred to the Committee on Rules of
    Practice and Procedure for consideration.
                            CoURTS IN BANe

       The Conference noted a report by Judge Biggs that the Com­
    mittee on Court Administration had authorized the Chairman to
    appoint a subcommittee to consider any problem inherent in courts
    sitting in bane if the number of circuit judgeships is substantially
    increased in some circuits.
                                   16
  DEFENDANTS AT LARGE AFTER AFFIRMANCE OF CONVICTION

   Judge Biggs next repOorted to the Conference that his Committee
had studied the problems raised by Senator R. C. Byrd concerning
the circumstances surrounding the release of John M. Eldridge, a
criminal defendant who killed a policeman and committed suicide
 while released on bond after the Supreme Court of the United
States had completed its review and the mandate had issued.
   Judge Biggs reported that it was his Committee's conclusion
that Eldridge was at large at the time of the attempted robbery
and murder of the policeman because of a failure of communication
between the United States Attorney's Office and the District Court
which four weeks before the crime was committed had ordered the
bench warrant withdrawn, set aside the bond forfeiture and re­
instated Eldridge's bond in an ex parte hearing.
   The Committee was of the view that remedial actiOon by the
court system has now been taken whereby the clerk, with informa­
tion promptly supplied by the Department of Justice, maintains
an up-to-date list of defendants at large on bond. The Conference
agreed that the responsibility in a situation such as the Eldridge
case rests upon the prosecution and the Conference agreed further
to request the Department of Justice to make an examination of
its records of defendants to ascertain that no defendant remains
at large whose conviction has been finally affirmed on appellate
review.
                    ADMISSIONS To PRACTICE

  The Conference voted to disapprove H.R. 3145, 90th COongress,
which WOouid provide that any member Oof the bar Oof the Supreme
COourt would be eligible fOor admission to the bar Oof any United
States court with the exceptiOon Oof the United States District Court      -I
for the District of Columbia. Similar bills were considered and             !
disapproved by the Conference at its March 1965 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 17). The Conference requested the Committee to study
the prOoblems inherent in this legislative proposal fOor further report.
   The Conference also considered a suggestion by Chief Judge
Joseph C. Zavatt Oof the Eastern District of New York suggesting
certain changes in the certificates Oof admission printed by the
Administrative Office and distributed to the United States district
courts. The Conference was in agreement that the form of certifi­
                                 17 

cate of admission to a United States district court should be left
at the discretion of the individual courts.
        SALARY OF' DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

   Judge Sylvester J. Ryan pointed out to the Conference that the
bill to create a Federal Judicial Center provides that the salary
of the Chief of the Center shall be the same as that of a United
States district judge. He stated, on the other hand, that the pro­
posed center would be housed in the Administrative Office of the
UnitBd States Courts and that the Director of the Administrative
Office would be a member of the Board of the Center. The present
salary of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts is $27,000. Judge Ryan moved and the Conference
approved a resolution that the Congress be requested to increase
the salary of the Director of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts to be the same as that of a United States
district judge and the Chief of the proposed Federal Judicial Center
and with the same retirement benefits. The Conference further
approved a commensurate change in the salary of the Deputy
Director.
                   REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman, presentBd the report
of the Commitee on the Revision of the Laws.
                            CoNTEMPTS

   Judge Maris reported that his Committee and the Committee
on Court Administration met jointly to consider the provisions
of S. 300, 90th Congress, which would amend Section 401 of Title
18, United States Code. The bill would prohibit the courts of ap­
peals from reviewing, restricting or restraining the district courts
in the exercise of their power to punish for contempts of their
authority except upon appeal from final orders or judgments· of
commitment for contempt. The Conference agreed with the recom­
mendation of the two committees that it would not be in the
public interest or promote the administration of justice to restrict
in the manner proposed by S. 300 the powers of the courts of ap­
peals to review contempt proceedings in district courts.
                                 18 

STATUTORY REVISIONS RESULTING FROM MERGER OF ADMIRALTY
                      AND CIVIL PROCEDURE

   The Conference noted that. by the amendments to the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure which became effective July 1, 1966 and
which merged admiralty procedure into the existing civil procedure
a number of provisions of Title 28 and other statutes has been
superseded and other statutory revisions have been modified.
Inasmuch as the Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules is
comprised of specialists thoroughly familiar with the details of this
problem, the Conference requested that committee to undertake
the preparation of a bill to bring the provisions of Title 28, United
States Code, and other pertinent statutes into harmony with the
provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the
litigation of admiralty or maritime claims and to submit its draft to
the Committee on Revision of the Laws for consideration and ulti~
mate submission to the Conference.

                DISTRICT COURT OF PuERTO RICO

   The Conference agreed to recommend to the Congress the repeal
of Section 41 of the Act of March 2, 19'17, as amended by Section
20 of the Act of June 25,1948 (c. 646, 62 Stat. 989, 48 U.S.C. 863).
This section of the statute has four separate parts, three of which
are regarded as obsolete or fully supplied by other statutes and
the fourth not only obsolete but also confusing and unnecessary.
The provision with respect to the naturalization jurisdiction has
been superseded by Section 310 of the Immigration and National~
ity Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1421) which expressly confers upon the
district courts of the United States, including the Puerto Rico Dis­
trict Court, jurisdiction of naturalized persons as citizens of the
United States. The payment of salaries of the judges and officials
and other expenses of the court are now made directly by the
Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
pursuant to Section 604 of Title 28, United States Code. Authoriz~
tion for payment is given in several sections relating to court per­
sonnel in Title 28, all of which apply to the District Court for the
District of Puerto Rico as they do to any other district court of
the United States. The provision of the designation by the Presi­
dent of a judge of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico as a tem­
porary judge of the District Court in the case of the death, absence    t
                                 19 

or disability of the district judge antedates the full integration of
the District of Puerto Rico into the Federal judicial system by
Sections 41, 119, 132, 133 and 134 of Title 28, United States Code.
The provision for special diversity jurisdiction antedates the en­
actment of 28 U.S.C. 1332 which confers diversity jurisdiction
and is applicable to the District Court for Puerto Rico in common
with all the other district courts of the United States. By the pas­
sage of Public Law 89-571 the Congress has now amended 28
U.S.C. 134(a) so as to confer the same life tenure upon the United
States district judges in Puerto Rico as is provided for other United
States district judges and thus the last remaining barrier to the
full and complete integration of the District Court in Puerto Rico
into the federal constitutional judicial system has been eliminated.
   The Conference, therefore, agreed that the courts of Puerto Rico
should handle so much of that special jurisdiction as is not com­
prehended within the general diversity jurisdiction granted to all
United States district courts by 28 U.S.C. 1332, and that direct
action cases should be handled by the local courts as they are
now required to be in Louisiana and Wisconsin.
                        SOCIAL SECURITY CASES

    The Conference considered and disapproved Section 2 of H.R.
 1312, 90th Congress, an act to amend Title 2 of the Social Security
Act to provide more equitable and efficient method for obtaining
administrative and judicial review of decisions of the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare and a more realistic definition of
"disability" for purposes of disability insurance benefits and the
disability freeze.
   The Conference noted that the effect of the bill with respect to
judicial review would be to transfer the ultimate determination
of Social Security disability claims from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare to a district court and jury, a proposal
which the Conference regards as involving not only a doubtful
question of public policy but a very greatly increased burden of
litigation in the district courts. The Conference expressed no view
with respect to the provisions of the bill relating to the nature of
evidence offered in proceedings in the Department and the defini­
tion of "disability."

           ROLE OF UNITED STATES IN CIVIL ACTIONS

   The Conference considered and disapproved H.J. Res. 146, 90th
Congress, a bill which would prohibit the United States or any of­
ficer or employee on its behalf to appear as amicus curiae or in any
other fashion -except as a party in any stage of any civil action in
any court of the United States.

                       OTHER LEGISLATION

   1. The Conference then considered several bills previously ap­
proved by it which have been reintroduced in the 90th Congress
and voted its approval in each instance. These bills are:
        a. S. 159 to provide for the temporary transfer to a single
district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings of civil
actions pending in different districts which involve one or more
common questions of fact (Conf. Rept., p. 62).
        b. H.R. 3081 which would extend the provisions of Section
1963 of Title 28, United States Code, for the registration of judg­
ments to the district courts of the Virgin Islands, Guam and the
Canal Zone and provide for the registration of that portion of
divorce decrees providing for the payment of money or the transfer       (
of property (Conf. Rept., March 1965 Session, p. 15).
        c. H.R. 3088 to provide for the publication before entry of
decrees, judgments and orders entered by consent upon the merits
of civil antitrust proceedings in the district courts and in proceed­
ings before a board or commission for the enforcement of any provi­
sion of the Clayton Act or the Federal Trade Commission Act
(Conf. Rept., March 1965 Session, p.15).
        d. H.R. 4334 which would amend Section 2401 of Title 28,
United States Code, to toll the running of the statute of limitations
against tort claims of persons under legal disability or beyond the
seas at the time their claims accrue (Conf. Rept., March 1965 Ses­
sion, p. 16).
        e. S. 597, H.R. 2512 and H.R. 5650 provide for the codifica­
tion and revision of Title 17, United States Code, relating to copy­
rights. The Conference specifically approved Chapter 5 of these
proposals relating to judicial remedies for copyright infringement
 (Conf. Rept., March 1966 Session, p. 8).
   2. The Conference approved in part and disapproved in part the
provisions of S. 946 and H.R. 5281 which would amend the Tucker          (
                                  21 

Act to increase from $10,000 to $50,000 the limitation on the juris­
 diction of United States district courts in suits against the United
States for breach of contract or for compensation. The Conference
specifically approved Section 1 of H.R. 5281 and the similar provi­
sions of S. 946 relating to the increase on the jurisdictionallimita­
tion from $10,000 to $50,000 (Conf. Rept., March 1966 Session,
p. 9). The Conference, however, specifically disapproved of Section
2 of H.R. 5281 providing for the waiver of the statute of limita­
tions on certain claims of Reserve officers (Conf. Rept., March 1966
Session, p. 10).
   3. The Conference disapproved specifically by number certain
bills reintroduced in the 90th Congress which had heretofore been
disapprov.ed by the Conference as follows:
        a. S. 176 to provide for the establishment of a United States
Court of Labor Management Relations which shall have juris­
diction over labor disputes which result in work stoppages which
adversely affect the public in terest of the Nation to a substantial
degree (Conf. Rept., September 1966 Session, pp. 38, 39).
        b. S. 301 and S. 302 which would prohibit the issuance of
writs of mandamus and prohibition by the courts of appeals based
upon interlocutory or non-appealable orders of the district courts
or as a substitute for interlocutory appeals allowable under 28
U.S.C. 1292(b) (Conf. Rept., September 1966 Session, p. 40).
        c. S. 621 to accord the right to a trial by jury to a defendant
in a land condemnation proceeding who is aggrieved by the deter­
mination of the issue of just compensation by a commission ap­
pointed by a district court under Rule 71A(h), Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, and S. 979, a bill to achieve the same objective
(Conf. Rept., Sep,tember 1965 Session, p. 63).
        d. H.R. 5267 to provide for the enforcement of separate
orders in certain state and federal courts and to make it a crime to
move or travel in interstate and foreign commerce to avoid com­
pliance with such orders (Conf. Rept., September 1965 Session,
p.63).
        e. S. 933 to amend the provisions of United States Code with
respect to the jurisdiction of courts of appeals to review orders
of administrative officers and agencies (Conf. Rept., March 1965
Session, p. 16).
                                 22
                       VETERANS' ApPEALS

  The Conference reaffirmed previous action with respect to vari­
ous proposals for the judicial review of veterans' claims as follows:
  1. The Conference approved the portions of several bills as to
the type of review provided, i.e., by a Court of Veterans' Appeals,
but expressed no opinion as to the policy of granting judicial re­
view of veterans' claims (H.R. 603, H.R. 1354, H.R. 2293, H.R.
2907 and H.R. 3334) (Conf. Rept., March 1966 Session, p. 10).
   2. H.R. 809, a bill to establish a Court of Veterans' Appeals
and to prescribe its jurisdiction and functions, was disapproved
as to those sections which would include the Court of Veterans'
Appeals among the courts of the United States and would require
the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts to assume responsibility for its administrative affairs (Conf.
Rept., March 1965 Session, p. 18).
   3. The Conference disapproved H.R. 2411 to provide for deter­
mination through judicial proceedings in the district courts of
claims for compensation on account of disability or death resulting
from disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty while
serving in the active military or naval service, including those
who served in peacetime (Conf. Rept., March 1965 Session, p. 18).
   4. The Conference disapproved H.R. 3601 which would confer
upon the Court of Claims jurisdiction to review de novo claims
for benefits and payments under laws administer:ed by the Veterans
Administration (Conf. Rept., March 1965 Session, p. 18).

       COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                  PROCEDURE 

  Senior Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman, reported on the
Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
  Judge Maris advised the Conference of the passage of Public
Law 89-773 which amends 28 U.S.C. 2072 so as to confer upon the
Supreme Court authority to prescribe the rules of procedure in
the courts of appeals in civil cases, including those involving mari­
time claims, and in agency reviews. Thus, the Supreme Court now
has full authority to promulgate uniform appellate rules which
Judge Maris stated are in the final stage of preparation. Only one
proposed rule remains to be considered by the Committee, namely,
Rule 30 relating to the manner in which the pertinent parts of
                                 23 

the record on appeal are to be reproduced for the use of the judges
of the court. A rule proposed by the Advisory Committee, together
with two alternative drafts, has been distributed widely to the
bench and bar for comment.
  Judg.e Maris reported that the Advisory Committee on Civil
Rules has just approved a draft of revised rules in the field of de­
positions and discovery. These rules will soon be published and
distributed to the bench and bar for comm.ent.
  Judge Maris stated further that the Advisory Committees on
Rules of Bankruptcy and Rules of Evidence are continuing in­
tensive work on their tasks of preparing comprehensive drafts on
rules in their respective fields. Much work remains to be done be­
fore drafts will be ready for submission to the bench and bar.
   COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
   Circuit Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, Chairman of the Advisory
Committee on Intercircuit Assignments, reported on the work of
his Committee for the period August 27,1966 to January 26,1967.
   Judge Breitenstein reported that in the period covered by his
report the Committee has recommended 25 assignments to be
undertaken by 22 judges, three judges having each accepted two
assignments. Th.e Chief Justice approved all assignments recom­
mended by the Committee. Among the assigned judges were four
circuit judges, four senior circuit judges, six district judges, seven
senior district judges and one senior judge of the Court of Claims.
Judge Breitenstein stated that 11 of the assignments were for serv­
ice in courts of appeals. He advised that the Chief Judge of the
Customs Court had requested help because of vacancies existing
in that court but that the Committee was unable to locate a judge
for this assignment. He again emphasized to the Conference the
need for long-range planning in connection with intercircuit as­
signments and stressed the difficulty of finding a judge on short
notice.
              BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
  The Chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy Administration,
Senior Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., reported that the Committee
had met and considered the recommendations contained in the
survey report of the Director of the Administrative Office, dated
January 20, 1967, relating to the continuance of referee positions
                                       24 


to become vacant by expiration of term, for new referee positions
and for changes in salaries and arrangements for referees to become
effective on April 1, 1967 unless otherwise indicated.
   The Committee also considered the recommendations of the
district judges and the circuit councils concerned.
   The Conference considered the Committee's report and the rec­
ommendations of the Director, the judicial councils and the district
judges. On the basis of the report and recommendations, the Con­
ference took the following action relating to referee positions and
changes in salaries and arrangements in the several districts con­
cerned. In each instance, the recommendations have been approved
by the district courts and by the circuit councils concerned.
                    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
District of Oolumoia
    (1) 	Authorized the continuance of the referee position in Washington In 

         which the term of office will expire on June 30, 1967 for a new six-year 

        term, effective July 1, 1967, the regular place of office, territory and 

         place (}f holding court to remain as at present. 

    (2) 	Approved the change in this position from a part-time position at II 

         salary of $11,000 per annum to a fwl-time position at a salary of $22,500 

         per annum, effective April 1, 1967 or as soon thereafter as appropriated 

         funds can be made availwble. 


                                FIRST CIRCUIT
District of Maine
    (1) 	Authorized the continuance of a full-time referee position at Bangor

                                  ApPROPRIATIONS

       The Conference was advised that estimates of appropriations
    for the fiscal year 1968 totaling $12,042,000 have been submitted
    to the Congress; that hearings have been held before the Subcom­
    mittee of the House Appropriations Committee. These estimates
    include funds for the salaries of all referee positions now authorized
    and include funds for sixty additional clerical positions and for
    other services for referees' offices. The Conference was advised that
    it will be necessary to obtain an increase in the appropriation for
    salaries of referees in an amount of $25,000 because of the Com­
(   mittee's recommendations which the Conference approved. The
    Conference was further advised that income from the system in
    fiscal years 1967 and 1968 is expected to fall below the obligations
    for these two fiscal years.
       As of June 30, 1966 the total surplus in the Referees Salary and
    Expense Fund was $9,985,809.
                               NEW CASE FILINGS

       Judge Hamlin reported that a total of 192,354 cases was filep.
    in the bankruptcy courts in fiscal year 1966. In the first half of
    fiscal year 1967, 99,080 caSes were filed, representing an increase of
    8.2 percent over the corresponding period of the preceding year.
    Total filings for the fiscal year 1967 are estimated to reach 205,000
    cases.
       An analysis of the cases filed in the first half of fiscal year 1967
    indicates that 91.7 percent are non-business cases compared with
    90.6 percent non-business bankruptcies in 1965.

                            LEGISLATION

   The Conference considered three proposals introduced in the
first session of the 90th Congress and voted disapproval of each:
    (1) H.R. 2521 is a bill sponsored by the National Bankruptcy
Conference which would amend Sections 1(19), 5, 32a, 64a(1) and
67( 4) of the Bankruptcy Act pertaining to partnerships and
partners and related provisions. The Conference agreed that the
objectives of the bill were generally good but was opposed specif­
ically to proposed Sections 5d(1) and 5d(3). These proposed sec­
tions would give the bankruptcy court summary jurisdiction to
determine the membership of a partnership when a petition is
filed by or against a partnership. Upon adjudication of the partner­
ship, the bankruptcy court would be permitted, at the insistence
of any party in interest, to determine whether there will be a
deficiency for partners not joined as bankrupts to make up. If a
deficiency is found, the court would be permitted to enter judg­
ment for this amount against one or more of such partners or
authorize the deposit of a security adequate to insure payment of
the deficiency. If the judgment is not duly paid or the deposit
timely made, adjudication of the defaulting partners is authorized.
The Conference noted that these proposed new subsections have
no provision for adjudication upon notice and hearing and agreed
with the Committee's recommendation that the court should not
take assets of a co-partner to satisfy a partnership deficiency with­
out such notice and hearing.
   (2) H.R. 2520 is a bill sponsored by the National Bankruptcy
Conference which proposes numerous amendments throughout
Chapter XIII relating to wage earner proceedings. Specifically, the
bill would amend Sections 606(1), 614, 623, 624, 626, 633(4), 642,
646(2),652, 656(b), 659 (2) and (3), and 662, and would add new
sections 644 and 657(1). The Conference was of the view that            "
generally the objectives of the bill are good but disagreed with the
bill in its present form. The Conference objected specifically to
those sections which would change the title of (ttrustee" to (tdis­
tributing agent." The Conference also objected to the new language
to be added to Section 642 for the reason that if state law does
not make (tloss of profit" a measure of damages, the Bankruptcy
Act should not do so; there appears to be no sound reason to give
a creditor a right in a Chapter XIII proceeding that he does not
                                  31 

pOS8ea> under state law. The Conference further objected specifi­
cally to amendments to Sections 646(2) and 652 relating to non­
assenting secured creditors and in so doing agreed with the
Committee that claims should not be considered secured beyond
the value of the security and that such claims should be reduced
to the value of the security in lieu of permitting the secured creditor
to be excluded from the plan. The Conference agreed that the
Committee should continue its study of problems arising in
Chapter XIII cases.
   (3) H.R. 2078 is a bill to amend Section 17 of the Bankruptcy
Act to provide that taxes shall not be discharged and that debts
that are not released by the bankruptcy proceeding shall be ex­
plicitly described in the order of discharge. In disapproving this
proposal the Conference agreed that it would place upon the bank­
ruptcy courts an overwhelming burden in holding hearings involv­
ing issues of fact as well as law relative to various claims to
determine whether particular debts come within the several classes
excepted from discharge by Section 17 of the Act. The Conference
noted also that the bill is inconsistent with H.R. 4990-8. 578
(90th Congress), the so-called dischargeability bill previously ap­
proved by the Judicial Conference (Conf. Rept., September 1963
Session, pp. 84-85). The Conference further saw no reason for re­
peal of the recently enacted Public Law 89-496 which provides
for the discharge of debts for taxes due and owing more than three
years preceding bankruptcy.

                   FEEJS   AND SPECIAL CHARGES

   The Conference considered four specific recommendations relat­
ing to fees and special charges, taking the following action:
   (1) Approved a revision of Schedule of Special Charges to be
made under Section 40c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act to provide "for
searching the records of the referee's office and furnishing informa­
tion regarding any bankrupt or debtor, $1.00." The Conference
noted in support of this change that there is a growing demand
upon the bankruptcy courts for lists of creditors' claims with in­
formation concerning the bankrupt's discharge and the like, and
that the time of the clerical staffs consumed in the preparation of
such data· is becoming burdensome in many of the courts;
   (2) The Director of the Administrative Office was authorized
and directed to prepare and seek the introduction in the Congress
                                  32 

 of an appropriate bill to amend Section 4Oc(I) and Section 52a
 to change the allocation of the clerk of court's portion of the filing   (
 fee from $8.00 to $3.00 in straight bankruptcy Chapter XI and
Chapter XII cases. The Conference noted that the $8.00 clerk's
fee was established by the Referees Salary Act, effective July 1,
 1947, and has remained unchanged although the services required
of the clerk of court with respect to bankruptcy cases have been
substantially reduced since that time. Section 22 was amended in
 1959 to provide for automatic reference of bankruptcy cases, ob­
viating the need for preparation of orders of adjudication in
voluntary proceedings. Fund accounting and deposit proceedings
have been simplified and bankruptcy case docketing and case re­
porting procedures of the clerk were simplified in 1963, relieving
 the clerk of the maintenance of active bankruptcy files and dockets
while cases are pending. The Conference noted further that by al­
locating $5.00 of the $8.00 clerk's fee to the Referees Salary and
 Expense Fund the income of the Fund would be increased $825,­
000, based on fiscal year 1967 estimates, without increasing the
cost of these proceedings to bankrupts. The Conference also noted
that with this additional income to the Fund, it may be possible
to reduce the percentage charges against assets of bankrupt estates,      (
thus reducing costs of administration in these cases.
   (3) The Conference did not accept the Committee's recom­
mendation for an increase of one--half to one percent in the Sched­
ule of Fees authorized to be promulgated under Section 4OC(Z) of
the Bankruptcy Act to be charged in asset and nominal asset cases.
   (4) The Conference also disapproved the Committee's recom­
mendation that the Schedule of Fees and Charges in arrangement
cases filed under Chapter XI be increased. In disapproving this
and the preceding item the Conference was of the view that the
legislation approved to permit reallocation of $5.00 of the $8.00
clerk's fee to the Referees Salary and Expense Fund will com­
pensate for the additional charges which have been incurred during
the past year by the Fund because of increases in salaries and
expenses of the system.
                  AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

  The Conference noted that the Bankruptcy Division is continu­
ing the examination of statistical reports of closed asset bankruptcy
cases for the determination of errors in the computation of amounts

due the Referees Salary and Expense Fund and over-payments of
compensation to receivers and trustees. The Conference noted that
pursuant to its authorization at its March 1966 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 23) the audit program has been extended to arrangement
proceedings concluded under Chapter XI of the Act during the
current fiscal year but that there is at present no systematic exam­
ination of costs of administration in wage earner proceedings
administered under Chapter XIII. The Conference agreed that
inasmuch as these wage earner cases are growing in number in the
current fiscal year, the studies of costs of administration be ex­
tended to Chapter XIII cases.
         DEVELOPMENTS IN THE              USE   OF CHAPTER        XIII
   The Conference received a report from the Administrative Office
that the filing of Chapter XIII cases is increasing in the current
fiscal year and that the estimated total of new wage earner cases
in 1967 is 30,000 as compared with 28,261 in 1966. An increasing
number of Chapter XIII trustees are using automatic data proc­
essing facilities for record keeping and the production of notices
and reports to creditors. The Conference noted in the report of
the Bankruptcy Division, however, that it will improve adminis­
tration insofar as the bar, creditors and other parties in interest
are concerned to have wage earner cases all handled by the same
referee's office, either permanently or for reasonable periods of
time. Accordingly, it approved the following guideline:
     It is the sense of the Conference that in multiple referee offices all wage
   earner cases should 'be regularly referred to one referee or, in the alternative,
   that the supervision of wage earner proceedings should be rotated peri­
   odically but not more frequently than biannually 'Ilmong the several referees.
The Conference further approved an additional guideline in
Chapter XIII cases as follows:
      It Is the sense of the Conference that referees should carefully review
   expenses of Chapter XIII trustees to the end that such expenses shall be
   reasonable and necessary and exclude such items as bar aSlroclation dues,
   association membership dues, travel and 8Ilbaistence expenses incident to
   attendIng meetings of profeSSional associations, entertainment, purchase of
   law 'books, subseriptlons to publications, and the like. Referees should
   likewise periodically review the compensation allowance of the trustee to
   the end that it will be reasonable and not in eX(!ess of the maximum
   compensation of a full-time referee.

                      SEMINARS FOR REFEREES

  Judge Hamlin reported that the Fourth Annual Seminar for
Referees in Bankruptcy was then in session in Washington, D.C.
(March 27-31, 1967), with twenty-seven referees attending as
participants. He reported further that regional refresher seminars,
primarily for referees who have attended one of the annual semi­
nars, have been held at New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Cleveland, Chicago, Denver, and Kansas City, Missouri. Judge
Hamlin reported that the seminars are conducted by the referees
who serve as discussion leaders and that the response has been
gratifying.
                    COSTS OF ADMINISTRATION

   The Conference was informed that cost studies of the Bank­
ruptcy Division for fiscal year 1966 showed continued improve­
ment in over-all costs of administration in straight bankruptcy
asset cases. In fiscal year 1964 the percentage cost of administration
of these cases was 26.6 percent in cases having an average realiza­
tion of $4,840; in 1965 this percentage cost was lowered to 25.7 per­
cent in cases having an average realization of $5,227 and in 1966
the percentage cost was down to 24.8 percent in cases having an          (
average realization of $5,363.
   Judge Hamlin reported that in reviewing the procedure of the
Bankruptcy Division in presenting costs of administration to
judges and referees the Committee had received a report of a
subcommittee composed of Chief Judge. Bailey Aldrich and Judges
Edward Weinfeld and Wesley Brown. The Conference noted that
the Committee believes that the studies of costs of administration
should be concentrated on attorneys' fees which comprise over
41 percent of the total costs of administration and that the courts
should adhere closely to the requirements of Section 58a(8) of
the Bankruptcy Act requiring notice to creditors of all applications
by receivers, ancillary receivers, marshals, trustees, committees and
attorneys for compensation from a bankrupt estate for services
rendered, specifying the amount and by whom made. The Com­
mittee also recommended that General Orders 42 and 44 be closely
observed and no attorney's fee be allowed without an appropriate
and detailed fee application which should include professional
duties only and should never be based on duties properly performed
by a trustee, receiver or other non-professional officer.

             CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964
   Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman of the Conunittee to
Implement the Criminal Justice Act, presented the report of that
Committee.
   The Conference noted that during the first half of fiscal year 1967
the Administrative Office had received 9,211 orders appointing
counsel under the Criminal Justice Act, of which 265 were by the
Court of General Sessions for the District of Columbia which be­
gan on December 1, 1966 to utilize the provisions of the Act in
accordance with the ruling of the Comptroller General of the
United States. Judge Hastings advised the Conference that by the
end of January 1967 the number of orders of appointment by the
Court of General Sessions of the District of Columbia had risen
to 611.
   The Conference 'also noted that during fiscal year 1966, repre­
senting a period of approximately ten months and ten days, attor­
neys were appointed to represent a total of 15,635 defendants and
575 appellants. Cumulative net disbursements under the Act in
the first half of fiscal year 1967 were $979,092. Investigative, ex­
pert or other services which have been authorized during the first
half of the fiscal year 1967 are estimated to cost $18,879 as com­
pared with approximately $31,000 obligated for this period in
fiscal year 1966.
   Judge Hastings further stated that a statistical analysis of the
financial affidavits executed by 2,243 defendants revealed that 26
percent were employed and 74 percent were unemployed. Of those
who were employed the average weekly salary was $63.00.
   Judge Hastings stated that the total amount requested in the ap­
propriation request for fiscal year 1968 to implement the Criminal
Justice Act is $3,500,000. This constitutes an increase of $500,000
over the sum requested for fiscal year 1967 to provide funds to
extend the coverage of the Act to the District of Columbia Court
of General Sessions.
    REPRESENTATION OF SAME DEFENDANT IN Two TRIALS

   The Conference noted that the Committee had been requested
for its views on the compensation to be allowed counsel in in­
stances where a second trial was necessary for a defendant. The
question arose as the result of a second trial in the District of
                                 36 

Columbia which was required because the first trial resulted in a
hung jury. The Chief Judge of the Circuit ruled that the statutory
limit of $500 applied because he did not consider the case to in­
volve protracted litigation as defined by the statute. The Con­
ference agreed with the Committee that it could not see any basis
for setting a firm standard in such cases and agreed that each must
be decided on its individual merits by the appropriate district
and chief circuit judges.

                     STATUTORY AMENDMENTS

  Judge Hastings reported that the subcommittee, <lhaired by
Senior Judge Harvey M. Johnsen (Conf. Rept., September 1966
Session, p. 53), had met with repr.esentatives of the Department
of Justice and had begun discussions as to the areas where im­
provement in the Act might ultimately be possible. He advised
that the Committee and the Department representatives were in
agreement at this point, however, that experience is still too in­
conclusive to warrant making any proposals. Judge Hastings re­
ported further that a representative of the Department of Justice
met with the full Committee and that excellent working relation- (
ships have been established between the Department and the
Committee.
                  AVAILABILITY OF LoCAL PLANS

  Because of some complaints which have been received from ap­
pointed <lounsel that th.ey had difficulty in obtaining copies of local
district and circuit plans to implement the Act, the Conference
directed the Administrative Office to communicate with all federal
judges requesting them to review their practices in making their
plans available to avoid the possibility of appointed counsel not
having proper access to them.
   ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on the Administration of the Probation System.
                      SENTENCING INSTITUTES

  The Conference approved the holding of a joint sentencing insti- \
tute for the judges of the Fourth and Fifth Judicial Circuits at
                                    37 

    Atlanta, Georgia, on October 29-31, 1967. Judge Hoffman ad­
    vised that the agenda will be presented for Conference approval
    at the September 1967 meeting.

        PROPOSAL FOR    A   UNITED STATES CORRECTIONS SERVICE

       The Conference noted that two identical bills, S. 916 and H.R.
    5038, had been introduced in the 90th Congress to create a United
    States Corrections Service which would remove from court con­
    trol the supervision of persons on probation. The Conference voted
    disapproval of these bills in their present form.
       Judge Hoffman advised the Conference that a subcommittee of
    the Committee on the Administration of the Probation System,
    chaired by Judge William B. Herlands, had met with representa­
    tives of the Attorney General's office in an effort to develop legis­
    lation which would be mutually satisfactory to the judiciary and
    the Administration. As a result of these meetings an amended
    draft of S. 916 had been developed which would make changes with­
    in the correctional organization of the Department of Justice and
    would provide a strengthened, well-structured Corrections Council
    to replace the now inactive Advisory Corrections Council. The bill,
    as amended, would not divide or dislocate the probation service.
    The Conference approved the amended proposal as submitted by
    the Committee.

            RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY TREATMENT CENTERS

      The Conference considered a proposal now being drafted in the
    Bureau of Prisons which would make available the several resi­
    dential community treatment centers of the Bureau of Prisons for
    selected probation and parole cases, thus affording housing and
    treatment facilities not now available to such persons. The Con­
    ference approved the proposed legislation in principle and pur­
    pose and noted that the Committee would give further study to
    the provisions of the bill.
                            RESEARCH PROJECTS

       Judge Hoffman advised the Conference of a proposal of the
    Center for Studies of Criminal Justice of the University of Chicago
    to conduct a research project in cooperation with the probation
(   office of the United States District Court of the Northern District
    of Illinois. The Center which itself is funded by the Ford Founda­
                                38 


tion will seek a grant from the National Institute of Mental
Health to finance a proposed project which will be designed to test (
the possible value of using sub-professional personnel, including
some rehabilitated former offenders, as counselors under the close
supervision of skilled probation officers. Judge Hoffman advised
that the Committee approved the concept of the project.
   Judge Hoffman also reported on the progress of the five-year
research project conducted by the School of Criminology, Univer­
sity of California, in cooperation with the probation office of the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Cali­
fornia under a $275,000 grant from the National Institute of Mental
Health. This project is now in its third year and some of the data
produced thus far have raised questions with respect to some pre­
vailing probation concepts and practices. Judge Hoffman stated
that the Probation Division of the Administrative Office had pro­
posed to the University the expansion of the project to include a
representative number of federal probation offices in dissimilar
districts to validate the tentative findings of the San Francisco
project and to determine to what degree they may be relevant
elsewhere. Judge Hoffman stated that the Committee had endorsed
the proposal with the understanding that probation offices would be (
selected for participation only with the concllrrence of the re­
spective courts. The proposal anticipates funding through federa1
government sources.
      ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  Circuit Judge George C. Edwards, Jr., Chairman, presented the
report of the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal
Law.
                  FEDERAL MAGISTRATES ACT

  Judge Edwards reported that pursuant to the authorization of
the Conference at its September 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 54)
he had conferred with the Chairman and members of the staff of
the Senate Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery
concerning the differences between the Committee and the Senate
Subcommittee in the bill to establish a system of full-time and
part-time United States magistrates in place of the present system
of United States commissioners. Judge Edwards stated that the
Committee at its last meeting considered a redraft of S. 3475, 89th   (
                                  39 

 Congress. He reported agreement on two areas of differences which
 remained after the September 1966 session of the Conference. He
 stated that the draft bill would in Section 636(b) (1) allow the
district court to assign the United States magistrate the power
 within his territorial jurisdiction to serve as a special master in
an appropriate civil action. The draft bill adds to this provision
 the condition that this delegation is subject to the applicable pro­
visions of Title 28, United States Code, and the Federal Rules of
 Civil Procedure. He stated that the Committee approved the provi­
 sions of this section of the draft bill subject to the qualifications
expressed in LaBuy v. Howe Leather Company, 352 U.S. 249, and
 also subject to the observation that this approval is not to be con­
 strued to modify or extend the present rules on the use of special
masters. He stated that the Committee was of the view that these
qualifications could be met by incorpomtion of a reference to the
 LaBuy rule in the report of the Congressional Committee.
    Judge Edwards reported further that the draft bill in Section
636(b) (2) provides that the court may delegate through the mag­
istrate the duty of providing assistance to the district court in the
conduct of pretrial or discovery proceedings in civil or criminal
actions. He stated that the Committee approved this version in lieu
of the counterpart provision which had appeared in S'. 3475. He also
reported that the draft bill includes among powers and duties which
may be assigned to magistrates (636(b) (3)) "preliminary review
of applications for post-trial relief made by individuals convicted
of criminal offenses and submission of a report and recommenda­
tion to facilitate the decision of the district judge having jurisdic­
tion over the case." He advised the Conference that the Committee
approved this version subject to the addition of a phrase after the
word ({case"-"as to whether there should be a hearing."
   Judge Edwards reported further that the other area of prior dis­
agreement with the Senate subcommittee involved Section 302 of
S. 3475 extending the jurisdiction of a magistrate designated for
that purpose to try a "minor offense" where the defendant signs a
written consent waiving trial before the district court and trial by
jury. He stated that the definition of "minor offense" in the draft
bill has been narrowed to meet the approval of the Committee by
excepting from such jurisdiction a list of misdemeanors deemed
inappropriate to the trial jurisdiction of magistrates. The Con­
ference voted its approval of the draft bill which the Committee
                                 40 

had last considered subject to the qualifications expressed by Judge
Edwards.                                                                 (
       JURISDICTION OF UNITED STATES CoMMISSIONERS

   Judge Edwards reported that the Department of the Interior
is sponsoring a draft bill which would extend the petty offense
trial jurisdiction of designated commissioners to petty offenses
committed in areas where the United States exercises only proprie­
tary jurisdiction. The present provisions of the statute now are
limited to areas where the United States has exclusive or concur­
rent jurisdiction and the amendment would extend the jurisdiction
of the commissioner to petty offenses committed with any federal
area administered for wild life, park, recreation, natural or historic
purposes. The Conference approved the proposed bill in the event
that the Federal Magistrates Bill is not enacted by the Congress.
               ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCING

   The Conference considered S. 2722 and H.R. 14343, 89th Con­
gress, which provide for the appellate review of sentences imposed
in criminal cases. The Co~ference agreed with the principle of ap­       (~.
pellate review on the condition that (1) three years be the mini­
mum appealable sentence; (2) the bills exempt from the provisions
for appellate review sentences providing for an indeterminate
term (e.g., 18 U.S.C. 4208(a), 5010); (3) that language be added
to provide that a decision of a panel of the court of appeals shall
be final and there shall be no right to file or have considered an
application for an en banc review of such panel decision except
that the court of appeals may sua sponte on its own discretion
grant further review en banc and (4) language be added to clarify
the fact that there is no right of appeal except to the United States
court of appeals and that any application for review in the Su­
preme Court must be by petition for a writ of certiorari to review
a claim of constitutional violation.
CoMMITMENT OF PImsoNS ACQUITrED ON THE GROUND OF INSANITY

  Judge Edwards reported that the Committee had considered
bills pending in the 89th Congress (S. 3689, S. 3753 and S. 1007).
He stated that the Committee was in full agreement on the vital
need for federal legislation in this area but that inaSmuch as the
                                 41 

Committee has been advised that extensive hearings are planned
on bills to be introduced in the 90th Congress and since the in­
terested executive agencies have not had an opportunity to express
their views, he requested and the Conference granted authoriza­
tion for the Committee to continue its study of this subject and re­
port to the next session of the Conference.

                AMNESTY FOR FIRST OFl''ENDERS

   The Conference disapproved the form of H.R. 8373 (89th Con­
gress) which was reintroduced in identical form in the 90th Con­
gress as H.R. 5714, a bill providing for amnesty for first offenders
(Conf. Rept., September 1966 Session, p. 56). The Conference
approved the recommendation of the Committee that the ap­
propriate committee of the Congress be advised that while it dis­
approved of the form of the bill providing amnesty for first
offenders, the Conference favors the principle of providing amnesty
for some first offenders.

                       OrHER LEGISLATION

  The Conference considered and disapproved two additional
legislative proposals as follows:
   1. S.J. Res. 179, 89th Congress, proposing an amendment to
the Constitution relating to the powers of courts of the United
States to review convictions in criminal actions.
  2. S.J. Res. 196, 89th Congress (reintroduced in the 90th Con­
gress as S.J. Res. 22), which would make an admission admissible
against a defendant in any court if it was made voluntarily,

COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY
                SYSTEM
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury
System, Circuit Judge Irving R. Kaufman, presented the Com­
mittee's report.
                        JURY SELECTION

  Judge Kaufman reported that pursuant to the authorization of
the Conference at its September 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 57),
a subcommittee was appointed to study the mechanics of the sev­
eral proposals relating to both federal and state methods of selec­
                                 42 


 tion of juries subject to the principle endorsed by the Conference (,"
 of random selection of jurors in a manner which wQuld produce a
 fair cross-section of the community in the district or division in
  which the court is held. As a result of the work of the subcom­
 mittee and subsequently of the full committee, he presented to the
 Conference for consideration and the Conference approved a draft
 of a bill to assure non-discrimination in federal and state jury
 selection and service.
    Title 1 of the draft bill as approved by the Conference provides
 for the random selection of jurors. Voter lists are to be used as
 the source of prospective jurors except in a few jurisdictions where
 voter lists do not represent a fair cross-section of the community.
 In those areas provision is made for the use of other sources.
 Title 1 employs the approach of the Criminal Justice Act in pro­
 viding for the adoption of a plan for random jury selection for
 each judicial jurisdiction or division subject to the approval of
 the judicial council and under rules adopted by the Judicial Con­
 ference of the United States. The bill permits separate plans for
 each division within a judicial district and in districts without
 statutory divisions, the equivalent of a division may be estahlished
 by order of the district court for the purpose of the Act.           (
   The bill also requires that the district plan spell out procedures
for the selection of names to go into the master wheel so that the
names of persons residing in each of the political subdivisions of
 the district or division will be represented in the wheel in sub­
stantial proportion, either to the number of actual voters at the
last general election in each political subdivision or to the number
of registered voters if registration of voters is uniformly required
throughout the district or division.
   The bill requires that the plan provide for periodic emptying and
refilling of the wheel; that it specify those occupational classes or
groups of persons whose members may on individual request either
be excused from jury service subject to the qualification that the
district court must find and the plan must state that jury service
by such class or group would create undue hardship or extreme
inconvenience to the members and that excusing such individual
would be consistent with the policy of and rights secured under
the Act. Other provisions for exemption are spelled out in the bill
as are the procedures incident to the public drawing of names at
random from the master jury wheel.                                    ( _j
                                      43 

      Title 2 of the draft bill prohibiting discrimination in state jury
    selection and providing to secure the right to an impartial state
    jury is substantially similar to Title 2 of the Civil Right.s bills
    submitted to the Congress by the Administration in 1966 and 1967
    and approved by the Conference (e.g., R.R. 14765).
       In approving the Committee's draft bill, the Conference dis­
    approved the following bills pending in the 90th Congress: S. 383,
    S. 384, S. 385, S. 386, S. 387, S. 1318 and S. 1319, all bills relating
    to jury selection. The Conference noted that S. 989, 90th Con­
    gress, substantially embodies the recommendations of the Com­
    mittee which it has approved as Title 1 of the Committee draft.

                      CRIMINAL CoNTEMPT STATUTE
       Pursuant to Conference action at the September 1966 session
     (Conf. Rept., p. 57) Judge Kaufman appointed a subcommittee
    headed by Judge Gignoux to study the possible statutory conflicts
    which might result from the Supreme Court's opinion in ChefJ v.
    Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, which held that sentences exceeding
    six months for criminal contempt may not be imposed by federal
    courts unless a jury trial has been received or waived. As a result
(
    of the subcommittee's deliberations, Judge Kaufman presented
    for Conference consideration a draft of a federal contempt statute
    which would spell out the distinction between those criminal
    contempts which may, by limiting the sentence which may be
    imposed to the petty offense maximum (six months imprisonment
    and/or $500 fine), be disposed of without the necessity of offering
    the accused trial by jury and those contempts which may be tried
    only by jury unless jury trial is waived. After consideration
    of the proposed bill, the Conference approved it and directed the
    Administrative Office to transmit it to the Congress.
          COMMITTEE ON SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
      The Chairman of the Committee, Judge Theodore Levin, pre­
    sented the Committee's report.
                          SECRETARIES   TO   JUDGES
       The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the bill originally
    introduced in the 89th Congress and reintroduced in the 90th Con­
    gress as R.R. 1091 to provide the same retirement benefits for
                                  44 


secretaries to federal judges as are now enjoyed by Congressional ( .. ~
employees.
         SUPPORTING PERSONNEL FOR A DISABLED JUDGE

   Judge Levin reported that his Committee, at the request of the
judge involved, reconsidered the specific case which the Director
had presented to the Conference at the September 1966 session
 (Conf. Rept., p. 32), as a result of which the C-onference had
instructed him that the appointment of a law clerk and a bailiff­
messenger should not be processed for a judge who had been
certified as permanently disabled under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.
372(b) by the Judicial Council of his Circuit and who had also
been found to be permanently disabled by the President in appoint­
ing an additional judge as provided in Section 372(b). Upon Judge
Levin's report of the Committee's consideration of the case, the
Conference agreed that no further action was required.
                          CLERK'S OFFICE

  The Conference approved the recommendation of the Committee
that one additional law clerk be assigned to the Southern District       (
of New York to handle pro se matters. The position was regarded
as necessary to relieve the judges of a great amount of detailed
research work which has developed as a result of a large increase
in the volume of habeas corpus and other prisoner petitions. The
Conference also directed the Budget Committee to include a re­
quest for funds for this position in the appropriation for the
judiciary for fiscal year 1969.
                             LIBRARIANS

   The Conference declined to take any action in upgrading the
positions of the librarian and the assistant librarians of the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals library. The Conference took the position
that the grades of librarians and assistant librarians were estab­
lished after careful study and that these grades had been equitably
established.
                        CoURTS OF ApPEALS

   Judge Levin pointed out to the Conference that for the next
fiscal year the Congress is being requested to provide funds for         l_J
                                45 

22 staff law clerks, 33 clerk-stenographers and 36 messengers for
the courts of appeals. He advised the Conference that Chief Judge
Lumbard had proposed that no attempt be made to change the
current appropriation request but that the 1969 appropriation
request provide for one additional law clerk for each circuit judge
who regards the extra assistance as necessary; that with respect
to the 33 clerk-stenographers the fiscal 1969 budget reflect any of
this number not allowed in fiscal 1968 and that if the proposal for
an additional law clerk for each judge was approved, the item in
the current budget request for 36 messengers should be reexamined.
   Judge Lumbard also proposed that each chief circuit judge be
provided an administrative assistant to aid him in the administra­
tive load arising from increased caseloads, the addition of new
judges, the greater number of prisoner petitions, the need for more
three-judge courts and other matters, but if the 1968 request for
circuit coordinators to aid in the administration of the Criminal
Justice Act is granted, their duties should be expanded to include
those contemplated for administrative assistants.

           TRIAL PRAGrICE AND TECHNIQUE
   Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Committee,
presented the report of the Committee on Trial Practice and
Technique.
   Judg.e Murrah concentrated his report on the work of the Co­
ordinating Committee for Multiple Litigation, a subcommittee of
the Committee on Trial Practice and Technique. He noted that
most of the electrical equipment cases have now been terminated,
attesting to the success which the judges participating in the pro­
gram have achieved. He stated that other facets of antitrust litiga­
tion of a multi-district nature remained, such as the rock salt cases,
the aluminum cable cases and other types of multiple litigation.
Discussing the over-all problems of trial practice and technique,
he reiterated the importance of seminars for new judges and re­
ferred to the work of the Special Committee on Continuing Edu­
cation, Research, Training and Administration and stated that
                                                                                 r

his Committee is hopeful of a Federal Judicial Center to assist
not only in the training programs but in providing the necessary
staff assistance to the Conference committees.
                           RESOLUTIONS

   this Conference.
      That we record in the minutes of the Conference our unanimous recog­

   Conference of this excellent member and fine gentleman; That we shall
   sorely miss him at OUr future meetings, both as a judicial colleague and a
   friendly and happy associate; That we wish for him many more years of
   unexcelled service as a member of the federal judiciary in whatever form he
   may choose to serve; and That good health and happiness may attend him        C___ ) 

   and his lovely wife.

     Resolved, at the suggestion of the Chief Justice, that the members of the 

   Judicial Conference of the United States express their deep appreciation to 

   Honorable Edwin A. Robson, United States District Judge for the Northern 

   District of Illinois, for his pioneering services to the administration of 

   justice in the Federal judicial system as coordinator of multi-district liti­

   in supervising the conclusi()n of more than 1,900 cases arising out of the 

   electrical equipment antitrust proceedings involving over 25,000 separate 

   claims in thirty-five judicial districts. 

     The members of the Conference also extend to Judge Robson their best 

   wishes for a full and complete recovery and continued good health in the
