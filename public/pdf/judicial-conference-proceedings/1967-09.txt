   § 331.   JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES.

  be called by the Chief Justice at such times and places as he may designate.
    The district judge to be summoned from each judicial circuit shan be chosen
  by the circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual judicial conference
  of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 of this title and shall serve as a mem­
  ber of the conference for three successive years, except that in the year follow­
 ing the enactment of thiB amended section the judges in the first, fourth, seventh,
 and tenth circuits shan choose a district judge to serve for one year, the judges
 in the second, fifth, and eighth circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for
 two years and the judges in the third, sixth, ninth, and District of Columbia
 circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for three years.
    If the chief judge of any circuit or the district judge chosen by the judges
of the circuit is unable to attend, the Chief Justice may summon any other cir­
cuit or district judge from such circuit. If the chief judge of the Court of            «

 of his circuit or court and as to any matters in respect of which the administration
 of justice in the courts of the United States may be improved.
    The conference shall make a comprehensive survey of the condition of business
 in the courts of the United States and prepare plans for assignment of judges
 to or from circuits or districts where necessary, and shall submit suggestions

 fect of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as
 prescribed by the Supreme Court for the other courts of the United States pursu­
ant to law. Such changes in and additions to those rules as the Conference may

                                                                                             "
and delay shall be recommended by the Conference from time to time to the
Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modification or rejection, in
accordance with law.

conference on matters relating to the business of the several courts of the United
 States, with particular reference to cases to which the United States is a party.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE

                                         53 

      the Conference his report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, in
      accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.c. 604( a) (3). The Con­
      ference authorized the immediate release of the report for publica­
      tion and authorized the Director to revise and supplement the final
      printed edition to be issued later.
                              STATE OF THE DOCKETS

          Courts of Appeals.-Ten percent more cases were filed in the
       courts of appeals in 1967 than in 1966. Since 1960 the number of
       appeals docketed has more than doubled, Mr. Olney reported. At
       the same time the number of appeals pending has increased almost
       threefold. A total of 7,903 appeals was filed in the United States
      courts of appeals in fiscal year 1967. Appeals disposed of in the
      same year reached a record high of 7,527, an increase of almost
       1,000 over the prior year. Dispositions, however, were almost 400
      less than the cases filed and as a result on June 30, 1967, the num­
      ber of appeals pending on the dockets of the courts of appeals in­
       creased to a new record of 5,763.
         The largest increase in the docketing; of new appeals was in the
      Fourth Circuit where filings increased by 31 percent. Other large
( .   increases occurred in the Third Circuit, 24 percent; the Eighth
      Circuit, 14 percent; the Second Circuit, 12 percent; and the Sixth
      Circuit, 10 percent. Filings in the Fifth Circuit increased to a new
      high of 1,173. This is the fourth consecutive year in which cases
      docketed in the Fifth Circuit have exceeded 1,000. For the first time
      appeals docketed in the Second and Ninth Circuits exceeded 900.
         District Courts.-Cases filed in the United States district courts,
      exclusive of bankruptcies, leveled off for the first time in many
      years. In 1967 there were 70,961 civil actions filed as compared
      with 70,906 in 1966. Civil terminations rose almost 4,000, undoubt­
      edly reflecting the additional judge-power provided under the
      Judgeship Act of March 18, 1966. The median time interval from
      issue to trial for civil cases tried in the United States district courts
      rose in 1967 to 12 months as compared with 11 months in 1966.
      At the same time, three-year-old cases pending on the dockets of
      the district courts increased by 9.5 percent over the prior year.
         Criminal cases in the United States district courts rose almost
      three percent during 1967 to a total of 30,534. Increases were noted
      particularly in the number of Selective Service Act cases, prose­
      cutions for violations of the narcotics laws, and robbery and assault
           280-693--67----2
                                54 

cases. Terminations in criminal cases numbered 28,677, a total
substantially less than the number of case filings. As a result,
pending criminal cases on June 30, 1967, increased 16 percent over
those pending a year earlier.
   Bankruptcy cases continued to rise for the fifteenth consecutive
year. In 1967 a total of 208,329 bankruptcy cases was filed as
compared with 192,354 cases in 1966, an increase of 8.3 percent.
The proportion of business bankruptcies decreased to eight percent
of the total, whereas most of the bankruptcy filings, 92 percent,
were in wage-earner proceedings. The greatest numerical increases
in bankruptcy cases came in the Sixth and Ninth Circuits.
  Special Courts.-A heavy increase in the work of the Customs
Court was noted during 1967. The number of protest cases received
during the year increased from 32,655 in fiscal year 1966 to 108,693
in fiscal year 1967. The United States Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals showed a decrease in 1967 in the number of customs cases
but an increase in the number of patent cases docketed.

                JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
  The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief Judge
William J. Campbell, advised the Conference that the judiciary (
appropriation bill for fiscal year 1968 has been passed by the
House of Representatives but is pending in the Appropriations
Committee of the United States Senate. The judiciary has, there­
fore, been operating under continuing resolutions of the Congress,
limiting the program and activities of the courts to the amounts
authorized in the previous year.
   For fiseal year 1967 the Congress appropriated for the judiciary,
exclusive of the Supreme Court, the sum of $87,221,500. The cost
of operating the courts, including the Administrative Office, aggre­
gated $85,978,700, leaving an unobligated balance of $1,242,800.
This savings was in large measure due to judgeship vacancies.
Savings due to such vacancies also bring about savings in expendi­
tures for law clerks, secretaries and other employees normally
required for a judge's staff.                                          1

   For fiscal year 1968, the budget estimates for the judiciary, ex­
clusive of the Supreme Court, as submitted to the Congress aggre­
gated $93,603,400. The House Appropriations Subcommittee held
hearings on the budget in February 1967. On May 25, 1967, the
Committee reported the bill recommending appropriations aggre­
                                      55 

     gating $91,314,000. The bill as reported by the Committee was
     approved by the House of Representatives but with an amendment
     restricting expenditures in fiscal 1968 to 95 percent of the total
     estimated expenditures. On June 5, 1967, the Director of the Ad­
     ministrative Office addressed a letter to the Chairman of the Senate
     Appropriations Subcommittee advising him of his election, ap­
     proved by the Budget Committee, not to appeal for the restoration
     of any positions or items of expense which were denied by the
     House but to consider an amendment to the bill which would ex­
     clude the judiciary from the provisions restricting expenditures.
        The appropriations bill as approved by the House of Representa­
     tives contains obligational authority for nine additional deputy
     clerks and 22 staff law clerks for the courts of appeals; 30 additional
    deputy clerks for the district courts; 30 additional probation offi­
    cers and 23 clerk-stenographers for the probation system; and the
    conversion of 80 additional secretaries to the combination position
     of crier-law clerk. The House also allowed the full amount of the
     request made under the heading "Salaries of Referees," thus per­
    mitting the implementation of all of the actions of the Judicial
    Conference in March and September 1966. The House bill also
    provides for 40 additional clerical positions for referees' offices and
    six additional positions for the Administrative Office of the United
    States Courts.
        For fiscal year 1969 the Conference approved the recommenda­
    tion of the Budget Committee-a total budget, exclusive of the
    Supreme Court and the Customs Court, in the sum of $93,594,000,
    an increase of $3,710,000 over the amount included in the judiciary
    appropriation bill for 1968 as approved by the House of Representa­
    tives.
       The budget for 1969, as approved by the Conference, provides
    for 12 additional deputy clerks, 55 law clerks, and 33 stenographers
    for the United States courts of appeals. There is also provision for
"   83 deputy clerks for the United States district courts. The estimate
    for "Salaries of Referees" will permit implementation of the actions
    of the Judicial Conference with respect to, new referee positions and
    changes in salaries and arrangements of existing referees. Provision
    is also made for 97 additional full-time clerical employees for ref­
    erees' offices, the conversion of 15 part-time clerks to full-time
    status and the conversion of 23 temporary employees to a perma­
    nent status. For the Administrative Office provision has been made
                                 56 

for five new positions for the purpose of instituting a program for
compiling data on the record of federal offenders following their
discharge from prison or release from probation or parole super­
vision. Seven additional employees are also included in the Admin­
istrative Office to cope with the increased workload in the Division
of Procedural Studies and Statistics.
   The Conference further authorized the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office to amend the budget estimates for 1969 and submit
requests for supplemental appropriations required as a result of the
enactment of a federal salary bill, the jury selection and service
bill, the federal magistrates bill, and other pending legislation or
other purposes not yet anticipated in time for submission of the
 1969 appropriation request to the Conference.

SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON CONTINUING EDUCATION,
   RESEARCH, TRAINING AND ADMINISTRATION
   Chief Judge John S. Hastings, whose suggestion at the September
1966 session of the Conference led to the appointment of a Special
Committee on Continuing Education, Research, Training and Ad­
ministration (Conf. Rept., p. 37), brought to the attention of the
Conference the fact that the House of Representatives had passed
H.R. 6111, a bill substantially similar to the proposal for the estab­
lishment of a Federal Judicial Center which had been approved by
the Judicial Conference at its March 1967 meeting (Conf. Rept.,
p. 3). Judge Hastings pointed out that the bill which was passed
by the House of Representatives on June 19, 1967 differed from
the Conference approved bill primarily in requiring the supervisory
board of the Federal Judicial Center to study and determine ways
in which automatic data processing and systems procedure may be
 used in federal judicial administration. Judge Hastings pointed out
 that such a requirement had been considered to be implicit in the
Judicial Conference recommendation and the Conference agreed
 to reaffirm its position on the establishment of a Federal Judicial
Center and voted to endorse H.R. 6111 as passed by the House of
 Representatives.
                      JUDICIAL STATISTICS
   Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman, presented the report of
 the Committee on Judicial Statistics.
                        COURTS OF ApPEALS

    Judge Johnsen stated that the Committee had reviewed the
docket situation of all of the courts of appeals and it noted that
the number of cases docketed in the courts of appeals in fiscal year
1967 was 10 percent greater than in 1966, with the average of
docketings for the 88 existing judgeships thus increasing on a na­
tional basis from 82 cases in 1966 to 90 in 1967. Although termina­
tions have likewise increased from 55 per judgeship in 1960 to 85
per judgeship in 1967, nevertheless, terminations have not kept
pace with the docketing and as a result the number of cases pend­
 ing on June 30, 1967 stands at a record high of 5,763-more than
 two and one-half times as many as on June 30, 1960.
    Almost 22 percent of the pending cases are criminal appeals,
representing an increase of approximately 12 percent over the
 number of criminal appeals which remained pending on June 30,
 1966. Judge Johnsen also called to the attention of the Conference
 the substantially increased number of per curiams, in both civil
 and criminal cases, to which the courts of appeals have resorted in
 1967 in order to increase their terminations and keep pace with
 their docketings. Judge Johnsen stated that the Committee on
 Judicia.! Statistics wishes to emphasize the situation as to disposi­
 tions in the courts of appeals to indicate to the Conference that
 the courts have increasingly been resorting to a reduction in general
 opinion writing and to suggest that each court of appeals keep
 watch and make periodic appraisal of its use of this expedient so
  that it does not allow itself to be carried away by an overbalanced
 concern for dispositional and statistical accomplishment alone.
     Judge Johnsen reported further that it was the Committee's
  judgment on review of the statistics for fiscal year 1967 that the
  need previously expressed to the Conference and approved by the
  Conference in March 1967 (Conf. Rept., p. 9) was amply borne out
  by the statistics, namely, that there was a need for additional
  circuit judgeships in the Third, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits.
  He reported that S. 2349 had been introduced in the Senate to carry
  out this recommendation of the Conference and that hearings on
  this bill had been held before the Subcommittee on Improvements
  in Judicial Machinery on September 8.
     Judge Johnsen also reported that because of the recommendation
  made by Mr. Will Shafroth in his survey report on the courts of
  appeals that cross-appeals and consultations be dealt with as only
                                  58 

one case, the Committee had again reviewed the question of
separate docketing of cross-appeals and remained of the view that
where separate notices of appeal had been signed, separate docket­
ing fees should be collected by the clerks with separate docketings
being made, shown and so carried. No matter how such docketings
are recorded in the clerk's office, they still require separate indexing
and require separate identification where as often hruppens such
cross-appeals become appeals themselves with the initial appeal
being dropped.
                          DISTRICT COURTS                                  I
                                                                           i
   In reviewing the docket situation of the district courts, it was
noted that only 55 more cases were filed in 1967 than the 70,906
filed in 1966. There was an increase of approximately three percent
                                                                           I
of criminal cases over the 29,729 filed in 1966. The total number of
civil terminations rose to 70,172 at the end of the fiscal year.
Criminal terminations decreased so that the pending criminal case-
load at the end of fiscal 1967 had increased 16 percent over the
preceding fiscal year. Judge Johnsen reported further that the
number of civil cases which are three years old or more increased
by 9.5 percent in fiscal year 1967. He pointed out, however, that
the heaviest concentrations of these cases exist in five districts,
constituting approximately 59 percent of the total. He stated, how­
ever, that there was room for improvement in this area in practicaHy
all of the districts and urged the chief judges of the circuits, as
members of the Conference, to remember the opportunity which
exists for them to give impetus to the district court efforts through
the form of a letter written by them in transmitting to the chief
judge of each district court a list of such cases sent him by the
Administrative Office at the close of each fiscal year.
   Judge Johnsen also advised the Conference that his Committee
had examined all of the recommendations for additional district
judgeships and was of the opinion that no change in condition had
occurred in any district so as to present an emergency situation
which would require action by the Conference prior to the quad­            .1
rennial survey projected for mid-1968 of the needs of the district
courts.
                            FORM J.S.lO

  Judge Johnsen referred again to the action of the Conference
at its September 1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 35) directing the
                                       59 

      Committee to make a continuing study Df Form J.S. 10. He stated
      that the CDmmittee Dn Judicial Statistics was Df the view that it
      needed mOore basic data before it cDuld come to any solution Df the
      many questions which had been raised regarding FDrm J.S. 10. He
      stated that a subcommittee consisting of District Judges Carswell
      and RDbson had been appointed tOo gather data and suggestions
      and make analysis and recommendation to the Committee at its
      next meeting for presentation to the Conference at its March
      1968 sessiDn.

             COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
        The Chairman Df the CDmmittee on Court AdministratiDn,
      Judge John Biggs, Jr., presented the Committee's report.
                      JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT

         Judge Biggs reported that the Committee, pursuant to Confer­
      ence authorization at its March 1967 session (Con£. Rept., p. 15),
      was proceeding with a revisiDn of the Judicial Survivors Annuity
      Act to bring it into line with the Civil Service Retirement Act, par­
      ticularly with provisions relating to members Df CDngress. Judge
( .   Biggs requested, and the Conference granted, leave for the Com­
      mittee to consider the statutory amendments further and to report
      at a future session of the Conference.
         The Conference agreed with Judge Bigg,s' report that it seems
      desirable to amend the Act to permit a judge who marries after his
      accession to the judiciary and who had not before marriage chosen
      tOo bring himself within the purview of Section 376 of Title 18,
      United States Code, upon marriage to avail himself of the benefits
      of the Act. The Conference was of the view, however, that all
      amendments to the Act should be made at the same time and,
      consequently, the Conference made nD recommendation as to H.R.
      9391, 90th Congress, a bill which would permit a judge WhD marries
      after the six-month period provided in the statute to avail himself
      of the prDvisions of the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act.
                           ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

        Judge Biggs reported that his Committee had considered sev­
      eral bills and requests for additional judgeships and, except in two
      instances, these bills and requests had been before the Committee
      on Judicial Statistics. Judge Biggs reported further that the Com­
                                     60 

mittee on Court Administration was of the view that all ap­
plications for additional district judgeships should be deferred until
the fall of 1968 at which time the Committees on Court Adminis­
tration and Judicial Statistics would undertake a comprehensive
review of the needs of the district courts. The bills reported on
in this regard by Judge Biggs were:
    1. 	H.R. 9577, to provide an additional judgeship for the Eastern District
         of Texas.
    2. 	 H.R. 9608, identical with H.R. 9577.
    3. 	 H.R. 9688, identical with H.R. 9577.
    4. 	 S. 1957, to provide an additional judgeship for the Eastern District
         of Texas.
    5. 	 H.R. 7299, to provide an additional judgeship for the Northern District
         of Texas.
    6. 	 H.R. 10668, to provide an additional judgeship for the Western District
        of Texas.
    7. 	 H.R. 3568, to create an additional judgeShip for the Eastern District
         of Kentucky.
    8. 	 S. 656, to create an additional judgeship for the Eastern District of
         Kentucky.
    9. 	Request for two additional judgeshIps for the Eastern District of
        Michigan.
   10. 	Request for two add1tional judgeships for the Western District of
        Pennsylvania.
   n. 	R equest for an additional judgeship for the Northern District of New
         York.
   12. 	Request for an additional judgeship for the DistrIct of Colorado.
   13. Request for an additional judgeship for the District of Mexico.

                      PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

   The Conference acting on information received from the Judicial
Council of the First Circuit disapproved of S. 1705 and H.R. 10528
which would authorize the holding of court at Manchester in the
District of New Hampshire.
   Upon advice that the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit dis­
approved the proposal, the Judicial Conference also disapproved of
S. 1674, a bill to authorize the holding of court at Roanoke Rapids
in the Eastern District of North Carolina and S. 1170 which would
authorize the holding of court at Greenville in the Eastern District
of North Carolina.
   The Conference upon advice of Chief Judge Lumbard that the
Judicial Council of the Second Circuit had approved the proposal
for the holding of court in Mineola in the Eastern District of New
York, :inasmuch as court facilities were available in that location,
                                 61 

approved H.R 8376 providing for the holding of court at Mineola
as well as at Brooklyn in the Eastern District of New York and
disapproved H.R 8379, H.R 6853 and H.R 7122 which provide for
the holding of court at additional locations within the Eastern
District of New York.
   The Conference disapproved S. 475 providing for the holding of
court a,t Williston in the District of North Dakota and was advised
that the Judicial Council of the Eighth Circuit had also disapproved
of this proposal.
   The Conference disapproved H.R 838 and S. 342 which would
provide for the holding of court at Hyattsville in the District of
Maryland. Similar bills had been disapproved at earlier sessions
of the Conference (Conf. Rept., March 1967 session, p. 11). The
Conference noted that the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit
had expressed its disapproval of these bills but had entertained
the view that court should be held at some location near the Mary­
land-District of Columbia line where courtroom facilities could be
made available without expense to the United States.
   Upon advice from the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit that the Judicial Council of that circuit had
disapproved the holding of court at Rockford in the Northern Dis­
trict of Illinois, the Conference disapproved H.R 187 for the hold­
ing of court at Rockford.
   The Conference disapproved H.R 4265 providing for the hold­
ing of court at Reading in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and
noted that this met with the unanimous concurrence of the judges
of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and of the Judicial Council
of the Third Circuit.
               ADDITIONAL DISTRIGrS AND DIVISIONS

   The Conference voted its disapproval of S. 1873 which would
create an additional judicial district in the State of Louisiana at
Baton Rouge. In noting the approval of this suggestion by the
Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit, the Conference took note of
its policy that no new districts would be created unless required by
emergent circumstances such as large increases in population.
   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the creation of a new
division in the Western District of Texas incorporated in H.R.
8338 (Conf. Rept., September 1966 session, p. 36), but expressed
no preference as to whether court should be held at Midland or
     280-698--67----3
                                       62 

Odessa except to state that court should be held at either one loca­
tion or the other but not both.                                      (
   In the absence of a report from the Judicial Council of the Fifth
Circuit, the Conference deferred a decision on H.R. 11950 which
would include Panola and Shelby Counties within the Marshall
Division of the Eastern District of Texas.
                           VACATIONS OF JUDGES

  Judge Biggs brought to the attention of the Conference that the
matter of judicial vacations had been before the Conference on
several occasions and had been the subject of Conference reports.
He noted that there has recently been a Senatorial investigation of
the continuing backlog of untried criminal cases in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Judicial
Conference reaffirmed its policy expressed in 1956 and directed the
Administrative Office to bring to the attention of all federal judges
the resolution adopted at that time as follows:
     Resolved, That the Judicial Conference declares it to be the policy of the
   courts of the United States that in those circuits or districts where the dis­
   position of judicial business is not upon a current basis, vacations or holidays
   of individual judges should not exceed one month per annum. (Conf. Rept.,
   September 1956 session, pp. 11 and 12).                                             (

                    MATTERS RELATING TO JUDGES

  The Conference considered several bills relating to judges and
voted its disapproval of each as follows:
    1. 	 H.J. Res. 738, proposing a constitutional amendment to restrict the
         terms of office of "judges" of the Supreme Court to 12 years.
    2. 	 H. Con. Res. 200, proposing a constitutional amendment which would
         provide that vacancies on the Supreme Court should be filled only by
         individuals who have served as a judge of a state or federal court and
         have demonstrated certain qualities.
    3. 	H.J. Res. 333 which would amend the Constitution to require "federal
         judges", except those who have retired, to be confirmed in office every
         six years.
    4. 	 H. Res. 384 providing among other things that the Supreme Court
         should have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases in which
         the validity of a statute of the United States or of a state is in question
         and further that a federal or state statute or any provision thereof may
         not be declared unconstitutional "except with the concurrence of the
         full membership of the Court."
    5. 	H.R. 11007 which would amend the Constitution to provide that the
         Supreme Court can not overrule an act of Congress or of 'a state legisla­
         ture except by a majority of six votes.
    6. 	 H.J. Res. 418, RJ. Res. 420 and H.J. Res. 443 which would provide a
                                                                                           (

                  the 	Supreme Court by a resolution passed by two-thirds vote of the
                  House and Senate.
             7. 	H.J. Res. 465 which would amend the Constitution to require that Jus­
                  tices of the Supreme Court be reconfirmed in their offices every ten

             8. 	S. 1130 which would amend the Constitution by requiring Justices of
                  the Supreme Court to have fiv{! years judicial service prior to appoint­

             9. 	 H.J, Res. 203 which would require certain qualifications for Justices of

                  out the consent of the Senate.
            13. S. 1337 which 	would amend Section 47(a), Title 28, U.S. Code, to pro­
                  vide for the disqualification of circuit judges by affidavit for bias and
                  prejudIce.

        INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AS TO
          PAYMENTS MADE FROM CONDEMNATION FuNDS BY CLERKS OF
    (     COURT

           Judge Biggs reported that in January 1967 the Internal Revenue
        Service had held that clerks of the United States district courts
        are required to file information returns for compensation paid to
        or made available to property owners for the temporary use of
        real property acquired by the federal government in condemnation
        proceedings. Judge Biggs stated that his Committee had noted
        that the order would require the clerk to file an information return
        as to money representing "estimated compensation" for the "tem­
        porary use of land" when deposited in his registry account-prior
        to its disbursement-Dn order of the court. He stated that the
        Declaration of Taking Act, 40 U.S.c. 258(a), provides that money
        "vests" in the persons entitled thereto when paid into the registry
        of the court. The Committee was of the view, and the Conference
        agreed, that a clerk of court is not in a position to know who is
        entitled to it or in what shares without an adjudicatory process.
        The result of the Internal Revenue Service order, therefore, is to
        impose upon the clerks of court adjudicatory functions in respect
        to the disbursement of condemnation compensation money, a func­
(
                                64 

tion which clerks can not legally perform. The Conference agreed,
therefore, that the request of the Internal Revenue Service must

  The Conference took note of S. 1982 which would amend Sec­
tion 332 of Title 28, U.S. Code, by providing that the Judicial
Council of the District of Columbia Circuit is authorized to make
orders for all courts established or continuing in the District of
Columbia and would amend Section 338 of Title 28, U.S. Code,
by providing that the Chief Judge of the District of Columbia
Court of General Sessions, the Chief Judge of the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals and the Chief Judge of the Juvenile
Court of the District of Columbia shall be summoned annually to
attend the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia Circuit
in order to participate in the business of such Judicial Conference
pertaining to their respective courts. The Conference was in agree­
ment that these legislative proposals required further study and
authorized the Committee on Court Administration to report on
them at a future session of the Conference.
                     RETIREMENT OF JUDGES                              ('
   Judge Biggs pointed out to the Conference that the Committees
on Court Administration and on Revision of the Laws had been
concerned regarding the dichotomy in language between Sections
372(a) and 372(b), Title 28, U.S. Code. Upon discussion of this
matter the Conference agreed that this was a subject for further
consideration by the two Committees for subsequent report to the
Conference.
                     REVlEiW OF I.C.C. ORDERS
   Judge Biggs called the attention of the Conference to the fact
that I.C.C. orders are now reviewed by district courts comprising
three judges, one of whom is required to be a circuit judge. Appeals
from the judgment of such courts lie directly to the Supreme Court.
He stated that this system is an anomaly since in almost every in­
stance the agency reviews are brought to the courts of appeals of
the respective circuits and are reviewed by the Supreme Court on
certiorari. The Conference approved, in principle, the draft bill
providing for review of LC.C. orders by the respective courts of
appeals and for review by certiorari to the Supreme Court of the
                                                                       (

                                                                            !
                                                                                I

 United States. It agreed that the Committees on Court Administra­
 tion and on Revision of the Laws should reexamine the draft bill,
'particularly those provisions relating to the issuance of stays and
 interlocutory injunctions, and should present to the Conference a
 bill in final form at a later session.
                        COURT OF CLAIMS

   The Conference noted S. 1704 which would authorize the Court
of Claims to implement its judgments for compensation and enable
it to grant such relief as can now be granted by a district court of
the United States in any legal or equitable proceeding. The Con­
ference agreed that the bill should remain with the Committees on
Court Administration and Revision of the Laws for subsequent re­
port after further investigation and redrafting by the Committees.
   The Conference also noted S. 2020 and H.R. 11164 which would
provide that the Court of Claims should render judgments on claims
of the Indians, Eskimos and the Aleuts of Alaska against the United
States. The Conference agreed that these proposals should be ex­
plored with the Court of Claims and the Secretary of the Interior
and be made the subject of a future report to the Conference.
                         CuSTOMS CoURT

  The Conference noted a Congressional request for its views on
S. 1707 which would authorize the United States Customs Court
to maintain an office in the City of Los Angeles. It agreed that this
matter lies within the internal administration of the Customs Court
and that, therefore, the Judicial Conference should take no position
with respect to this proposaL
                          PRIVATE BILLS

  The Conference noted but took no action on S. 478, a bill which
would confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims to hear, de­
termine and render judgment on the claim of one Harold Braun
for disability retirement pay allegedly due him as a result of wounds
sustained while serving in the armed forces. The Conference was
of the view that it should take no action with respect to S. 1702
which would confer jurisdiction upon the United States District
Court for the District of Hawaii to hear and determine claims of
Agnes J. Wong based on alleged mistreatment while a patient in a
United States Air Force hospital and on S. 2096 which would confer
jurisdiction upon the District Court for the Western District of
                                  66 

 Wisconsin on the claim of Emma Zimmerli for compensation for
 personal injuries resulting from the alleged negligence of a United
 States letter carrier. The Conference noted that all three bills were
 based upon private claims which would prevent the United States
 from asserting defenses of the statute of limitations and that since
 these bills are in the nature of private bills, their enactment is a
 matter of policy to be determined by the Congress.
               REVIEW OF CoNFERENCE COMMI'ITEES

   Judge Biggs reported that it was now twelve years since the
 Conference had last reviewed its committee structure and that
there were now some fifteen or sixteen committees of the Judicial
Conference. He recommended and the Conference agreed to au­
thorize the Chief Justice to appoint a Committee on Committees
to examine the structure of the committees of the Judicial Con­
ference to determine which have overlapping functions and which
ones have functions which are no longer of current concern to the
Conference. The Conference was in agreement that a complete
survey of its committee structure as to status, number and func­
tions should be made and requested the Chief Justice to appoint a
Committee on Committees which would make the survey requested
and report back to the Conference.

                   REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Judge J. Skelly Wright who acted as Chairman of the Commit­
tee at its August meeting in the absence of Judge Albert B. Maris
presented the Committee's report to the Conference.
                        VIRGINIA DISTRICTS

   Judge Wright pointed out that Section 127 of Title 28, U.S. Code,
creates the Eastern and Western judicial districts of Virginia and
defines their area solely in terms of counties whereas in Virginia
incorporated cities are from a governmental political standpoint
wholly outside and independent of the counties from which their          .J
territory has been taken. The Conference agreed to a draft bill
prepared by the Committee which would add a third section to Sec­
tion 127 to correct this inadvertent omission by providing expressly
that cities of Virginia are part of that judical district in which
are located the counties within which they lie or from which they
have been incorporated.

                    ADMINISTRATIVE POOCEDURE ACT

   The Conference considered S. 518 and its companion bill H.R.
6163 which would amend and substantially revise the Administra­
tive Procedure Act. The Conference disapproved these two legis­
lative proposals in their present fonn because the proposals con­
tained in them for interlocutory judicial review of administrative
action would impose a substantially increased burden on the federal
courts.
                            OTHER LEGISLATION

   The Conference agreed that the Committee should study further
and report to a later session of the Conference its views on the
following legislation:
     1. 	S. 1642, H.R. 5924, B.R. 6643 and B.R. 6975, all bills which would
          generally revise the patent laws, Title 35, U.S. Code.
     2. 	 B.R. 10216, a bill to restore to persons having claims against the United
          States their right to be represented by legal coUID'Jel of their own
       choosing.
     3. 	S. 1867, B.R. 6487 and B.R. 7657, all bills relating to the establishment
       of a Court of Veterans Appeals.
     4. 	 S. 2641 and B.R. 10100, bills which would transfer the Tax Court to
          Title 28, U.S. Code, as a constitutional court.
   The Conference took no action on H.R. 2077, a bill to amend
Chapter 115 of Title 28, U.S. Code, to provide that courts of the
United States shall not take judicial notice of arrests of persons en­
gaged in peaceful activities in furtherance of rights under the
Constitution.
  The Conference took the position that S. 1351, a bill to provide
for the payment of reasonable costs, expenses and attorney's fees
to defendants in actions by the United States for the condemnation
of real property, was an issue of legislative policy with respect to
which the Conference should take no position.
  The Conference approved the twO' bills embodying proposals
heretofore approved by the Conference:
     1. 	 S. 1153 to amend the patent and tTade-mark laws with respect to appeals
          in patent and trade-mark cases (Conf. Rept., September 1965 Session,
          pp.62-(3).
     2. 	 B.R. 8633 to repeal the provisions of Section 41 of the Act of March 2,
          1917, as amended, relating to the United States District Court for the
          District of Puerto Rico (Conf. Rept., March 1967 Session, pp. 18-19).
  The Conference disapproved the following bills previously dis­
approved by the Conference:
    1. S. 1353 and companion bills to abolish the National Labor Relations
                                      68 

          Board and to establish in its place a United States Labor Court (Conf.
         Rept., September 1966 Session, p. 40).
     2. 	 S. 1837 to amend Section 47 of Titl" 28 U.S. Code, to provide means for
          disqualification of circuit judges for bias and prejudice (Coni. Rept.,
         March 1967 Session, p. 13).
     3. 	 H.E. 11471 to provide for the establishment of a United States Court of
          Labor-Management Relations which shall have jurisdiction over labor
          disputes which adversely affect the public interest of the nation to a
          substantial degree (Conf. Rept., March 1967 Session, p. 21).
     4. H.E. 11633 to provide for the enforcement of support orders in certain
          state and federal courts and to make it a crime to move or transfer in
          interstate and foreign commerce to avoid compliance with such orders
          (Coni. Rept., March 1967 Session, p. 21).
   The Conference considered S. 1277 and companion bills in the
House of Representatives relating to the appointment, terms and
classification of deputy U.S. marshals and to provide for the
appointment of U.S. marshals by the Attorney GeneraL The Con­
ference adopted a statement viewing favorably legislation which
tends to provide for adequate compensation for deputy U.S. mar­
shals but otherwise took no position on these bills since the proposals
embodied therein relate to employees of the executive branch.
COMMITTEE ON THE RULES OF PRACTICE AND
              PROCEDURE
   Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman, presented the report of the
standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
                      UNIFORM ApPELLATE RULES

  Judge Maris presented to the Conference proposed Federal Rules
of Appellate Procedure which have been prepared by the Advisory
Committee on Appellate Rules and approved by the standing Com­
mittee. He advised the Conference that these rules had been widely
disseminated to the bench, bar and law schools for comment in
March 1964 and as to Rule 30 once again in September 1966. The
comments and suggestions received were carefully considered and                      "j'

in many instances incorporated in the proposed rules which the                      .',.
Supreme Court now has authority to promulgate in all types of
cases as the result of enactment of Public Law 89-773, November 6,
1966, amending Section 2072 of Title 28, U.S. Code.
  The Conference considered and approved the proposed Federal
Rules of Appellate Procedure, as well as proposed amendments to
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure made necessary by the adoption of the Appellate Rules,
                                  69 

and directed the transmission of these rules and amendments to the
Supreme Court of the United States with the recommendation that
they be adopted.
                            CIVIL RULES

   Judge Maris advised the Conference that the Advisory Com­
mittee on Civil Rules has approved a draft of revised rules relating
to depositions and discovery which is now being prepared for the
printer and will soon be distributed to the bench and bar for con­
sideration, comments and suggestions.
                         CRIMINAL RULES

  The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules, Judge Maris re­
ported, is now studying various phases of the subject of preliminary
hearing and motions and the procedure for taking guilty pleas un­
der Rule 11. He stated that Professor Frank J. Remington, formerly
a member of the Committee, has taken the position of reporter for
the Committee.
                         ADMIRALTY RULES

  ,The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules is continuing to
study the effect in practice of the amended civil rules in their rela­
tion of maritime litigation. The Committee is proceeding with the
preparation of amendatory legislation to bring existing statutory
law into harmony with the new provisions of the civil rules relat­
ing to admiralty litigation.
           BANKRUPTCY RULES AND RULES OF EVIDENCE

  Judge Maris reported to the Conference that the Advisory Com­
mittees on Bankruptcy and on Rules of Evidence are continuing
intensive work on their tasks of preparing comprehensive drafts of
rules in their respective fields which when ready will be submitted
to the bench and bar for comment.
                 UNIFORM DISTRICT        CoURT RULES
  The Conference discussed the feasibility of adopting uniform
district court rules and agreed that the standing Committee should
examine the advisability of a study of this problem.
    COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  Judge Jean S. Breitenstein, Chairman of the Advisory Com­
                                        70 

mittee on Intercircuit Assignments, reported on the work of his
Committee for the period January 6, 1967 to August 18, 1967.
   During the period covered by the report Judge Breitenstein
stated that the Committee had recommended 37 assignments to be
undertaken by 32 judges. The Chief Justice has approved all assign­
ments recommended by the Committee. Among the assigned judges
were one circuit judge, seven senior circuit judges, 17 district judges,
four senior district judges, one judge of the Court of Claims and two
senior judges of the Court of Claims. He stated that 13 of the 37
recommended assignments were for service in the courts of appeals.
Eight of the assignments to district courts were for the District of
Puerto Rico because of the illness of the judge of that court and
the fact that the second judgeship position had not been filled.
                BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
   The Chairman of the Committee on Bankruptcy Administra­
tion, Judge Oliver D. Hamlin, Jr., presented the report of his
Committee.
   Judge Hamlin stated that the Committee had considered the
recommendations contained in the survey report of the Director
of the Administrative Office, dated July 7, 1967, relating to the                     (
continuance of referee positions to become vacant by expiration of
terms, for increases in salaries of referees and for one new full-time
referee position to become effective, unless otherwise noted, on
October 1, 1967, or as soon thereafter as appropriated funds are
available.
   The Conference considered the Committee's report and the rec­
ommendations of the Director, the judicial councils and the district
judges on the basis of which the Conference took the following
action relating to referee positions and changes in salaries and
arrangements in the several districts concerned. In each instance
the recommendations were approved by the district courts and by
the circuit councils concerned.

   The Conference noted that bankruptcy surveys were conducted
in ten additional districts at the request of judges or referees
of such districts but that the surveys revealed that recommenda­
tions for changes in salaries or arrangements were not justified at
this time. In the District of Oregon on which the Committee had
previously deferred action, Judge Hamlin advised that arepresenta­
tive of the Bankruptcy Division had conferred with the judges of
that district and as a result the court has submitted new recom­
mendations which will require a further survey by the Bankruptcy
Division prior to any recommendations to the Committee or the
Conference.
            REFEREES SERVING WITHOUT ApPOINTMENT

   The Conference noted that three referees have been serving for
a year or longer without appointment following the expiration of
regular six-year terms of office although the filling of the vacancies
involved has previously been authorized by the Conference. These
referee positions are in the Southern District of Texas in which
the term expired June 30, 1961, the Eastern District of Tennessee
in which the term expired November 23, 1964 and the Northern
District of Georgia in which the term expired March 9, 1966.

                              ApPROPRIATIONS
   The Conference noted that estimates of appropriations for fiscal
year 1968 totaling $12,042,000 were pending before the Appro­
priations Committee of the United States Senate. The Conference
also noted that the budget estimates for fiscal year 1969 are higher
by $55,500 for salaries of referees to provide for increases approved
by the Conference at its March 1967 session and the increases
approved by the present session of the Conference. The 1969 esti­
mates also provide for a substantial number of additional clerical
positions because of the increasing burden of the clerical work.
                            NEW CASE FILINGS
  The Conference noted that in fiscal year 1967 a total of 208,329
cases was filed in the bankruptcy courts, a numerical increase of
15,974 cases over the number filed in 1966. This represented a per­
centage increase of 8.3 percent. Approximately 92 percent of the
cases were non-business or the so-called consumer bankruptcy cases.
                                LEGISLATION
   The Conference considered and disapproved H.R. 2895, a bill
to amend Section 57(n) of the Bankruptcy Act. The Conference
noted that this proposed amendment to the Act would eliminate                        t
the one-year period within which infants and insane persons with­
out guardians without notice of the bankruptcy proceedings may
file claims and that all creditors without notice of the bankruptcy
proceedings may file claims without limitation of time if the referee
in his discretion determines such extension necessary to assure the
fair and equitable distribution of the debtor's assets. The Confer­
ence disapproved H.R. 2895 in its present form because the provi­
sions thereof are not limited to corporations, no ultimate time
limit is provided as in the present exceptions and the amendment
is not restricted to prospective distributions to creditors.
     FILING OF JOINT PETITIONS BY HUSBANDS AND WIVES
  In view of the requirements relating to filing fees and the need
for consistent and adequate statistical reports of cases filed, the
Conlerence adopted the following resolution:
     Resolved, That it is the sense of the Conference that, under the Bankruptcy
   Act as presently written, separate filing fees should be charged for each
   estate whether joint 'Or single petitions are filed in husband and wife cases;
   and that, for statistical purposes, each estate shall be reported as a separate
   case.
                                  75
                  AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS
   The Conference noted that the Bankruptcy Division is now
auditing statistical reports of both asset cases closed and arrange­
ment proceedings concluded under Chapter XI. The audit pro­
gram was extended to Chapter XI cases, effective January 1, 1967.
The audit of statistical reports of Chapter XI cases has disclosed a
number of misconceptions as to the proper basis for computing
amounts to be paid to the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund, as
a result of which instructions for determinations of amounts due
the fund will be clarified by the Bankruptcy Division in these cases.
   The Conference noted that a total of 406 arrangement cases was
concluded in the fiscal year 1966. In many of these cases, substan­
tial sums of money are involved and, when requested by the courts,
the Bankruptcy Division staff conducts a preaudit of case records
to determine the accuracy of payments into the Referees' Salary
and Expense Fund before the case is closed. In one such case now
in the process of closing, over 110 million dollars is involved, and
the payment into the fund will approximate $350,000.
                    MATTERS UNDER ADVISEMENT
  The Conference was informed that the number of matters re­
ported as under submission before referees 60 days or longer during
the past six months is consistent with prior reports to the Confer­
ence on this subject. Of the 203 referees reporting, 33 referees had
pending a total of 56 matters and 173 referees had no matters pend­
ing as long as 60 days.
            DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF CHAPTER XIII
   The Conference was advised of the report of the Administrative
Office that in fiscal year 1967 approximately 32,000 Chapter XIII
cases were filed as compared with 28,261 in 1966. The Conference
noted that the trend to increase the use of automatic data processing
facilities for trustees' record keeping is continuing and that par­
ticularly in the larger trustees' offices automatic data processing
methods will provide both improved records and better service to
the parties in interest and the public.
   The Conference was advised that the Committee has studied
the lack of uniformity in the fixing of Chapter XIII trustees' bonds
and to the need in some instances for more adequate surety bonds.
The Conference was advised that the Bankruptcy Division is mak­
                                76 

ing a study of the entire subject for a report to the Committee at
its next meeting and in the meantime the Conference was informed
the Committee has suggested that the Administrative Office recom­
mend surety bonds for Chapter XIII trustees of not less than double
the amount of the average distribution to creditors.
                     SEMINARS FOR REFEREES

   The fifth annual seminar for referees in bankruptcy and the final
seminar in this series will take place in Washington during the week
of March 25, 1968. Regional refresher seminars have been held
since January 1, 1967 at Los Angeles, Atlanta and Cleveland and
a fourth is scheduled to be held at Denver on October 6--7, 1967.
   The Conference noted that the published proceedings of the
Fourth Annual Seminar have now been distributed and that the
seminar program continues to receive a most encouraging response
from judges and referees.

             CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964
   Chief Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act.
   The Conference noted the statistical report for fiscal year 1967
prepared by the Administrative Office and observed that 22,315
orders of appointment had been received by the Administrative
Office. The Administrative Office estimates that when the addi­
tional orders of appointment executed in late June are received, the
total for the year will be in the area of 22,800. For the first time
appointment figures are available for the Court of General Sessions
of the District of Columbia which began to make appointments
pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act on December 1, 1966. Of the
appointments received by the Administrative Office for fiscal year
1967,29 percent were made by U.S. commissioners, 56 percent by
U.S. district courts, four percent by U.S. courts of appeals and 11
percent by the Court of General Sessions for the District of
Columbia.
   On disbursements made under the Act the Conference was
advised that thus far $1,029,886 has been disbursed out of the
appropriation for fiscal year 1967. Cumulative net disbursements
out of the appropriation for fiscal year 1966, as of June 30, 1967,
were $1,998,265. When all outstanding claims have been received
and paid, it is estimated that the total cost of representation of
                                 77 

criminal defendants for fiscal year 1966 under the Act will be
$2,350,000. In 1966 1,290 attorneys waived compensation for serv­
ices rendered. During 1967 the district courts authorized investi­
gative, expert or other services at a cost estimated to be $54,501. In
the same year 22 claims for protracted representation were ap­
proved by the chief judges of the courts of appeals.
   The Conference was advised that for fiscal year 1968 the House
of Representatives has allowed $3,150,000 for the administration
of the Criminal Justice Act, with a ceiling of $150,000 on payments
made pursuant to appointments by the Court of General Sessions
for the District of Columbia. This request is now pending in the
United States Senate. The Conference had already agreed in con­
sidering the report of the Budget Committee that a total sum of
$3,150,000 would be requested for the administration of the Crimi­
nal Justice Act for fiscal year 1969.
                     COUNSEL FOR JUVENILES

   The Conference was advised of two instances in which counsel
had been appointed for a juvenile whose parents are financially able
to obtain adequate counsel but refuse to do so. The Conference
agreed with the Committee recommendation that the number of
instances in which this problem has arisen is too few as yet to
warrant the establishment of a policy statement or guideline other
than to note a memorandum prepared in the Administrative Office
which in summary states that the law of the state wherein the
federal court sits which defines the obligation of a parent to com­
pensate an attorney for professional service incurred by a minor
is controlling.
                               FORMS

   The Conference noted a recommendation by a clerk of court that
the voucher form (Form 4) be amended to contain a statement by
which an attorney can waive compensation. The Conference was of
the view that such a statement would not be consonant with the
purposes of the Act and agreed that no such statement should be
included in the voucher form.
                      SUPREME COURT RULES

  The Conference took note of the fact that the revised Rules of
the Supreme Court which become effective October 2, 1967, provide
that in cases on direct review in which the defendant in the original
                                    78 

 proceeding is financially unable to obtain adequate representation
 or to meet the necessary expenses in the Supreme Court, the Court
 will appoint counsel who may be compensated and whose necessary
 expenses may be repaid to the extent provided by the Criminal
 Justice Act.
           COMPENSATION OF MORE THAN ONE A'l'TORNEY

     The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference a 

  situation in which a district court had appointed an attorney under 

  the Act in a non-capital case and then substituted another attorney 

  for the attorney originally appointed during the course of the litiga­

  tion. The court then approved vouchers for payment to each of the 

  attorneys. The case was not one involving protracted representa­

  tion. The Conference agreed that in this type of situation in a non­

  capital case, compensation for the two attorneys can not exceed 

  $500 and that either the two attorneys involved should make an 

  agreement on the division of the fee or that the court should direct 

  an appropriate division in approving the voucher. In so doing, the 

 Conference noted that 27 district court plans provide for this type 

 of action. 

                       STATUTORY AMENDMENTS                               (
    Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman of the subcommittee ap­
 pointed to consider amendments to the Criminal Justice Act in
 collaboration with the Department of Justice, reported on the
 study being undertaken on the administration of the Act by the
 University of Chicago School of Law under the direction of Pro­
 fessor Dallin Oaks. This project involves the study, in depth, of the
administration of the Act in five selected districts and is scheduled
 to be completed by December 31, 1967. The Conference was in
agreement that until Professor Oaks' study and report were com­
pleted so that a documented recommendation can be adopted and
transmitted to the Congress, the Conference should withhold any
recommendations for amendments to the Criminal Justice Act. The
Conference, however, took cognizance, as the Committee had in its
report, of the many expressions of opinion from many parts of the
country that the statute should be amended to include representa­
tion 6f defendants in post-conviction and ancillary matters, includ­
ing habeas corpus, Section 2255 and revocation of probation
proceedings.
                                79
       ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  Judge George C. Edwards, Jr., Chairman of the Committee, pre­
sented the report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law.
COMMITMENT OF PERSONS ACQUITTED ON GROUNDS OF INSANITY

  The Conference considered the Committee's report on S. 1007,
a bill providing for the commitment of persons acquitted on the
grounds of insanity. The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the
principle of this proposed legislation but agreed with the Com­
mittee recommendation that a suggestion be made to the Congress
that serious consideration be given to making the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare the agency responsible for receiv­
ing persons committed under this proposed legislation in lieu of
the Attorney General as now specified in S. 1007. The Conference
agreed that <the Committee should defer a final report on the bill,
however, pending the issuance of a study by the Department of
Justice which presumably will deal with the establishment within
the executive branch of an institutional program to receive persons
committed under the proposed statute.
    PROBABLE CAUSE HEARINGS AS A METHOD OF DISCOVERY

  The Conference received a report from the Committee requested
at the prior session of the Conference at which S. 945, the federal
magistrates bill, was approved that the Committee consider whether
probable cause hearings before commissioners should properly serve
as a preliminary method of discovery and whether S. 945 would
preclude such function. The Conference noted that the Committee
reported that S. 945, as approved by the Conference (Conf. Rept.,
March 1967 Session, pp. 38-40), does not intend that discovery will
be a primary function of the probable cause hearing. The
Conference took note of the fact that the Advisory Committee on
Criminal Rules is now studying the general topic of discovery in
criminal proceedings and agreed that further action by the Com­
mittee on the Administration of the Criminal Law should await
a report of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules.
              APPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCING

  After approving the principle of appellate review on certain
conditions at its March 1967 session (Conf. Rept., p. 40), the
                                     80 

Committee, at Conference request, gave further consideration to
the problem of ruppellate review of cases where the sentence pre- (
scribed by sta,tute provides for a mandatory minimum sentence.
The Conference approved a recommendation of its Committee con­
firming the general opposition of the Conference to mandatory
minimum sentences. The Conference further considered the spe­
cific provisions of S. 1540, a bill which passed the Senate on June 29,
1967, and noted that this bill does not contain the modifications
heretofore recommended by the Conference (Conf. Rept., March
1967 Session, p. 40). It noted that S. 1540 provides for an applica­
tion for leave to appeal. After discussion of the Committee report
on S. 1540, the Conference voted it.s endorsement of the bill with
the proviso that the statutory standard of review be specified as
the abuse of discretion of the district judge.
                          OTHER LEGISLATION
   The Conference took the action, as indicated, on the following
bills:
     1. 	Disapproved H.R. 7275, a bill to amend the Federal Youth Oorreetions
         Act by changing the terms for commitment thereunder in certain
         instances, to permit the use of ex'aminers and for other purposes.
    2. 	Agreed that S. 917 and companion bills designed to assist state and
         local government in reducing the incidence of crime and to increase
         the effectiveness, fairness and coordination of law enforcement and
        criminal justice systems at aU levels of government were bills which
         lie in the area of legislative discretion. The Conference did, however,
         approve the policy statement contained in Section 2 of S. 917.
    3. 	 Approved H.R. 2537, H.R. 4121, H.R. 5597 and H.R. £354, all MUs
        designed to protect the constitutional rights of mentally incompetent
         persons committed under Title 18. In s~ doing, however, the Conference
         agreed that one change should be made regarding the method of
        handling funds as provided in H.R. 2537 so that the phrase "to the
        court" would be eliminated in the final sentence of Section 251 after
        the words "funds appropriated."
    4. 	Disapproved S. 1194 and H.R. 6944 which would make the voluntary
        character of an admission or confession the sole test of admissibility
        and would limit the jurisdiction of any federal court to review the issue.
    5. 	After considering S. 675, H.R. 7093, H.R. 5386, H.R. 6710, H.R. 10037
        and H.R. 10090, all bills designed generally to prohibit wiretapping
        'and/or eavesdropping, the Conference agreed that the purposes of S. 675
        were most acceptable and approved these purposes and the bill pro­
        vided thllt it be amended to comply with the standards set forth in the
        opinion of the Supreme Court in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967).
    6. 	Disapproved S.J. Res. 22, S. 674, S. 1518, H.R. 7092, H.R. 6709, H.R.
        10889, H.J. Res. 313, H.J. Res. 365, all proposals which inter alia would
        establish a new test of admissibility of an admission or confession by
        amendment to the Constitution or by enactment of a federal statute. (
                                       81 

      7. 	 Considered H.R. 5269 and related bills proposing to establish an Academy
          of Criminal Justice and agreed that the subject matter of these pro­
         posals is generally one of legislative policy.
     8. 	 Approved S. 676 and companion bills which would provide punisbment
          for any person who wilfully endeavors by means of bribery, misrepre­
          sentation, intimidation or threats to obstruct, delay or prevent the
          communication of information relating to violation of criminal statutes
          of the United States.
     9. Approved 	S. 677, H.R. 6053 and H.R. 7095, bills which would allow
          application to the court to compel testimony and grant corresponding
          immunity to one testifying in connection with a violation of 18 U.S.C.
          1952, 18 U.S.C. 1503 or in connection with violations of Chapters 9 and
          11 of Title 18, U.S. Code.

             OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
 Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on the Operation of the Jury System.
                              JURY SELlllCTION

   Judge Kaufman reported on S. 989, a bill which incorporates
Title I of a draft previously approved by the Judicial Conference
(Conf. Rept., March 1967 Session, pp. 41-43), and stated that exten­
sive hearings have been conducted before the Senate Subcommittee
on Improvements in Judicial Machinery and a committ.ee report is
expect.ed in the near future.
   Pursuant to its action at the September 1966 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 57) in approving the principle of random selection of
juries, the Conference agreed to direct the Administrative Office
to communicate with the chief judges of the United States district
courts which have heretofore utilized the "key man" jury selection
system, in whole or in part, to ascertain whether such districts
have since adopted a system of random selection in a manner that
would produce a fair cross-section of the community in the district
or division in which couri is held. The Conference resolved further
that it is desirable that those courts which have not already done
so should convert as soon as convenient from the key man system
to the random system. In so resolving, the Conference agreed to
reaffirm its view that the passage of S. 989 as quickly as possible
would be of substantial benefit in producing desired uniformity in
jury selection and qualification procedures in the federal judiciary.
The Conference voted further to direct the Administrative Office
to provide those courts seeking to convert to a random selection
system with such administrative assistance as may be required,
                                  82

within budgetary limitations, and with such other technical assist­
ance as may be helpful, including the furnishing of model plans,
orders and forms relating to jury selection programs. Each court
adopting a district plan, report, order or rule relating to jury selec­
tion was requested to send copi~s to the Administrative Office.
                      PREJUDICIAL PUBLICITY

   The Conference at its September 1966 session approved a Com­
mittee study of the necessity of promulgating guidelines or taking
other corrective action to shield federal juries from prejudicial
publicity in the light of the Supreme Court decision in Sheppard v.
Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333 (Conf. Rept., p. 57). Judge Kaufman re­
ported that the subcommittee which he had appointed to study this
problem has conducted extensive research, and has met with repre­
sentatives of the press and the communications media. The Con­
ference agreed to approve the continuation of the subcommittee's
work pending the receipt of a report and recommendations.

   ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM

  Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman of the Committee
on the Administration of the Probation System, presented the Com­
mittee's report to the Conference.
                      SENTENCING INSTITUTE

   The Conference at its March 1967 session approved the holding
of a joint sentencing institute of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits at
Atlanta, Georgia, on October 29-31, 1967 (Conf. Rept., p. 36).
Judge Hoffman presented to the Conference and the Conference
approved a detailed agenda for this forthcoming sentencing
institute.
         RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY TREATMENT CENTERS

   The Conference approved H.R. 10511, a bill to amend Title 18
of the U.S. Code to authorize the Attorney General to admit to
residential community treatment centers persons who are placed
on probation, released on parole or mandatorily released. In so
doing, the Conference took note of the fact that at its March
1967 session, it had approved, in principle and purpose, a legisla­
tive proposal now embodied in H.R. 10511 (Conf. Rept., p. 37).
                                  83
               UNITED STATES CoRRECTIONS SERVICE

   Judge Hoffman reported to the Conference that there has been
no action by the Congress on S. 916 or H.R. 5038, bills disapproved
by the Conference at the March 1967 session (Conf. Rept., p. 37).
Judge Hoffman reported further that he had transmitted to the
general counsels of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House
Judiciary Committee copies of his letter of April 12, 1967 to federal
judges and chief probation officers setting forth the approval by
the Conference at its March 1967 session of an amended bill which
would make changes within the correctional organization of the
Department of Justice and would provide a strengthened, well­
structured corrections council to replace the now inactive Advisory
Corrections Council and which would not divide or dislocate the
probation service (Conf. Rept., p. 37).

                  SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

  Judge Theodore Levin, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee on Supporting Personnel.
                        COURTS OF ApPEALS

    The Conference approved that provision be made for 88 addi­
 tional law clerks for the judges of the courts of appeals. In so
doing, the Conference agreed that no additional messenger posi­
 tions should be sought and that upon appointment of an additional
 law clerk for a circuit judge, no replacement be made of the existing
messenger position for the judge receiving such additional law clerk.
The Conference also agreed that upon the granting of the appropri­
ation for additional personal law clerks, the authorization for staff
law clerks be rescinded and the appropriation be converted for the
compensation of personal law clerks.
    The Conference approved resuhmission to the Congress in the
budget for fiscal year 1969 a request for three additional secretaries
for each court of appeals.
   Judge Levin reported that the Committee on Supporting Per­
sonnel had considered at length the request of some chief judges
for the appointment of an administrative assistant to the chief
judge of each circuit. He stated that all members of the Committee
were in agreement that any request to the Congress for legislation
to provide for such an administrative assistant would require a
salary of librarians. The Conference was in agreement that a study
should be undertaken under the aegis of the Committees on Sup­
porting Personnel and Court Administration.
                       ADDITIONAL DEPUTY CLERKS

    The Conference approved a Committee recommendation for 12
 new deputy clerk positions for the courts of appeals and 34 for the
 district courts. The Conference also approved the renewal of the
 request to the Congress for the 49 deputy clerk positions which were
-eliminated from the appropriation for fiscal year 1968 by the
 Congress.
                       CoURT REPORTER-SECRETARY

   The Conference approved -the request of Chief Judge Register,
District of North Dakota, that the duties of his combination posi­
tion of court reporter-secretary be separated and that the judge be
authorized both a secretary and a court reporter.

             TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE

   Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on Trial Practice and Technique.
   The Conference approved at the Committee's suggestion a broad
program by the Committee on Trial Practice and Technique de­
signed to encourage the development of sound methods of dealing
with congested calendars in the district courts through the use of
accelerated calendars and other proven techniques of calendar con­
trol. The Conference further authorized the Committee to cooperate
with those districts having congested calendars in formulating
sound procedures of calendar control consistent with the needs of
their jurisdictions.
   Pursuant to a discussion of the need for preparing seminars for
newly appointed judges, the Conference approved the following
resolution presented by Judge Murrah on behalf of the Committee:
     Re8olved, That inasmuch as approximately one hundred judges have been
   appointed to the federal bench since the last seminar for newly appointed
   judges was held, the Committee on TrIal Practice and Technique is author­
   ized to sponsor and organize one or more seminars for such judges for the
   purpose of acquainting them with the problems of judicial administration
   arising in the operation of the district courts. It is the sense of the Confer­
   ence that the seminar programs should cover such matters as fundamental
   court procedures, techniques of ei'fecti've judicial administration, jurisdiction,
   and substantive problems arising in suits brought under federal statutes.
                                       86
    The number, time, place, duration, and program content of such seminar
    or seminars is left to the discretion of the Chairman.

                          :MULTIPLE LITIGA'l'ION

    Judge Edwin A. Robson presented a report relating to the ac­
 tivities of the Suooommittee for Multiple Litigation. He identified
as the areas of general concern to the subcommittee the air crash
mUltiple litigation, several aspects of antitrust litigation, patent and
trade-mark multiple litigation, products liability multiple litiga­
