by the circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual judicial conference
of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 of this title and shall serve as a mem­
ber of the conference for three successive years, except that in the year follow­
ing the enactment of this amended section the judges in the first, fourth, seventh,
and tenth circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for one year, the judges
in the second, fifth, and eighth circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for
two years and the judges in the third, sixth, ninth, and District of Columbia
circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for three years.
   If the chief judge of any cirCuit or the district judge chosen by the judges

   The conference shall make a comprehensive survey of the condition of business
in the courts of the United States and prepare plans for assignment of judges
to or from circuits or districts where necessary, and shall submit suggestions

fect of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as

ant to law. Such changes in and additions to those rules as the Conference may
deem desirable to promote simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration,

Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modification or rejection, in
accordance with law.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
     OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
  Mr. Ernest C. Friesen, Jr., Director of the Administrative Office
of the United States Courts, had previously submitted to the
members of the Conference his report for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1968, in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C.
604(a) (3). The Conference authorized the immediate release of
the report for publication and authorized the Director to revise
and supplement the final printed edition to be issued later.

                             S'rATE OF THE DOCKETS

(
       Courts of Appeals.-During 1968 there was an increase of 15.3
      percent in new case filings in the courts of appeals for a total of
      9,116 new appeals. Terminations increased over 1967 by almost
      10 percent. Terminations were still substantially less than the
      number of new cases docketed. The appeals pending on June 30,
      1968 were 14.8 percent above the number on the same date a year
      earlier. The greatest increase in new filings was in the Fourth
      Circuit with 27.6 percent, the Ninth with 26.4 percent and the
      Seventh with 24.7 percent. Small decreases were noted only in two
      circuits, the Third and the Eighth.
         The upward trend in the workload of the courts of appeals over
      the past ten years is demonstrated by the fact that in 1960 3,889
      new appeals were filed as compared with 9,116 in 1968. Termina­
      tions more than doubled in this period, from 3,713 in 1960 to 8,264
      in 1968. The pending case figure almost tripled, from 2,220 in 1960
      to 6,615 in 1968. In 1960 there were 68 judges in the courts of
      appeals; during 1968 there were 88 judges in these courts. On June
      18, 1968, the President approved Public Law 90-347 creating nine
      new circuit judgeships and making the foUll' temporary judgeships
(    in the Fifth Circuit permanent.
        District Courts.-The Director's report pointed out that the total
     number of civil and criminal cases filed in fiscal year 1968 rose by
     less than 7/10ths of one percent, thus continuing the leveling trend
     noted in the prior year. Because dispositions fell, however, the
     volume of pending civil and criminal cases at the end of the year
     increased to a new high of 97,245. The drop in terminations is most
     marked in civil cases; dispositions were less by almost 1,300 cases
     in 1968. At the end of 1967 there were 317 district judges in active
     service; by the end of 1968 this number had risen to 323.
        The marked increase in civil filings is particularly noted in three
     areas-federal prisoner petitions, state prisoner petitions, and civil
     rights. Substantial decreases were noted during 1968 in contract
     actions, suits involving real property and forfeiture and penalty
     suits filed by the government.
        The Director noted that median time intervals from issue to trial
     for civil cases remained at 12 months, with 10 months for non-jury
     and 15 months for jury trials. A serious disproportion in median
     time intervals appeared again in the larger metropolitan centers­
(    39 months in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, 36 months in
          828-897--68----2
                                 40 

the Southern District of New York, 31 in the Eastern District of
New York and 25 in the District of Columbia.
   The Director also pointed to the fact that civil cases pending on
the docket for more than three years have continued to rise each
year since 1963 and now constitute 10.3 percent of the pending
civil cases. These cases are concentrated for the most part in the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Southern District of New
York, Maryland, the Eastern District of Louisiana, the Eastern
District of New York, the Northern District of California and the
District of Columbia.
   The volume of criminal cases has remained relatively stable for
twelve years. A total of 30,714 criminal cases was filed in 1968 and
29,492 were terminated. The composition of criminal cases has
changed during the past year, with prosecutions for violations of
the Selective Service Act increasing by 37 percent. Narcotics, bur­
glary, robbery and homicide cases also rose appreciably while sub­
stantial decreases were noted in federal Civil Rights Act cases and
in prosecutions for violation of the immigration laws and the liquor
laws and for fraud.
   The Director stated that for the first time since 1952 new bank­
ruptcy cases showed a decline, with a total of 197,811 cases filed as
compared with 208,329 in 1967. This represents a decrease of five
percent. In 1968 the proportion of business bankruptcies increased
slightly with respect to the total cases filed although, numerically,
there was a small decline. Non-business filings constituted 91.6
percent of all the new bankruptcy filings.
    The Director reported that he has asked the Federal Judicial
Cen ter to make a study of the weigh ted caseload index to determine
whether this standard properly gives an opportunity to determine
judicial workloads. He also pointed to the fact that the delay in
criminal cases is partially attributed to the fact that the United
States Attorneys' offices are understaffed and that in too many
instances-almost 80 percent of the districts-the United States
Attorneys are still permitted to control the criminal calendar. He
 also pointed to the need for circuit administrators who are expert
in personnel matters, in questions of space and other administrative
problems, including paper work, management and calendar
control.

        The Director stated that during the past year the Administrative
     Office had established a computer data base for the civil jury trial
     calendar of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The system is
     designed to provide the court with current information) identifying
     the cases pending on the calendar and reporting on the status of
     pending cases. The system also provides comprehensive information
     on the disposition of calendared cases and on the method by which
     cases are terminated. Since trial counsel are identified in each case)
     the system also provides an indication of the role of counsel in the
     operations of the court and the degree to which local attorneys and
     law firms are active in federal court practice.
       The system is also being extended into the Southern District of
     New York and it is anticipated that further extensions into other
     districts will prove useful and effective in the calendar phase of
     court management.
                     FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER
         Mr. Justice Tom C. Clark, Director of the Federal Judicial Cen­
      ter, reported on the operations of the Center in its first year of
(	    operations. The Director stated that the first meeting of the Board
      was held on March 2, 1968, at which time Mr. Justice Clark was
      named as the first Director. The Board approved the initial budget
     requests of the Center and considered adequate housing facilities,
     as well as the general organization of the staff and the research
     projects pending before the Center. The Board held its second
     meeting on June 4, 1968.
        The Board of the Federal Judicial Center has organized six ad­
     visory committees made up of members from the judiciary, as
     well as from other disciplines, such as business) education, science,
     medical research, puhlic administration, industry and publications.
     The Committees are Operations and Appraisal, Research, Continu­
     ing Education, Innovation and Development, Federal-State Rela­
     tions) and Library and Publications.
        The Director stated that the Congress had appropriated $40,000
     for the initial operations of the Center in fiscal year 1968 and
     $300,000 for fiscal year 1969.
        The Director said that several projects were already in progress
     under the aegis of the Center, including a study of the criminal

 calendar in the Eastern District of New York aided by a grant of
 $8,000 to. the Institute of Judicial Administratio.n from the N a-        i
 tional Defender Program of the National Legal Aid and Defender
Association; a civil docket calendar control study in the Southern
 District of N ew York; a civil study of the calendar in the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania built upon the study undertaken by the
Administrative Office during fiscal year 1968; a comprehensive
study o.f the actual jury operatio.n in the Western District of Mis­
souri aimed at a determination of the present utilizatio.n o.f jurors
to secure more efficiency in operation and a saving in expense (with
the assistance of the American Bar Foundation); an experimental
project under the probation system which will reRect a treatment
tYPo.Io.gy to aid the pro.bation service to determine the most fruitful
supervisory relationships; a further pro.bation project alo.ng the
lines recently co.mpleted at the University o.f California in Berkeley
concerned with presentence and superviso.ry practices; a study o.f
systems procedures in the federal Co.urts, including the relative ad­
vantages o.f the master calendar and individual assignment calen­
daring systems; a study of a clerk's office, using as a test the Clerk's
Office fDr the Eastern District of Louisiana, to. determine the neces­
sary business practices and controls that would produce an efficient       (
operatio.n in a multiple-judge district; the preparatio.n o.f a desk
or bench bo.ok fDr district judges; a study of the assignment system
of judges to panels in a Co.urt of appeals; a study of the screening
process in the CDUrts o.f appeals to prevent severe clogging because
of frivo.Io.US appeals and a study of the increase in habeas corpus
cases in the district courts.
   The Director anno.unced that the third seminar to be conducted
in 1968 fo.r newly appointed judges which will be held in Washing­
ton, D.C., from October 25 thro.ugh November 1, 1968 will for the
first time be held under the sponso.rship of the Federal Judicial
Center, acting in conjunctio.n with Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah,
Chairman of the Judicial Conference Committee on Trial Practice
and Technique which has sponsored all previous seminars fo.r
newly appointed judges.

 JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION
  Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation, reported on the initial activities of the
Panel subsequent to its appointment by the Chief Justice on
                                     43 


    May 29, 1968. Judge Murrah pointed out to the Conference that
    the Panel was created by the enactment of Public Law 90-296,
    signed by the President April 29, 1968. The law created a new Sec­
    tion 1407 of Title 28, United States Code, providing for the transfer
    of certain multidistrict litigation for pretrial pUJ1)Oses only. The
    legislation was enacted partly as a result of the sponsorship and
    endorsement of the Judicial Conference of the United States. Judge
    Murrah said that the other members of the Panel are Judge John
    Minor Wisdom of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Chief
    Judge William H. Becker of the Western District of Missouri,
    Judge Joseph S. Lord, III, of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,
    Judge Edwin A. Robson of the Northern District of Illinois, Judge
    Stanley A. Weigel of the Northern District of California and Judge
    Edward Weinfeld of the Southern District of N ew York.
       Judge Murrah stated that the Panel held its organizational meet­
    ing on June 26, at which time it adopted provisional rules of pro­
    cedure and began operations. The first hearings of the Panel were
    scheduled to take place on August 8, 1968.                '­

                  COMMITTEE ON COMMITTEES

(      Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard of the Second Circuit, Chair­
    man of the Committee on Committees, presented the Committee's
    report.
       Judge Lumbard advised the Conference that the Committee had
    been created as a result of a recommendation made at the Septem­
    ber 1967 meeting of the Conference at which Judge John Biggs, Jr.,
    had stated that the Conference had not reviewed its committee
    structure for more than twelve years and that the time had come
    for a complete survey of the structures of Conference committees
    as to status, number and functions.
       As a result of the Committee's deliberations, the Conference ap­
    proved a recommendation that all of the existing committees of
    the Conference (other than the Committee on Rules of Practice
    and Procedure and its advisory committees which were not con­
    sidered in the Committee's deliberations) should be discharged and
    that the Chief Justice should be authorized to appoint the members
    of such committees and subcommittees as were now authorized
    by the Conference. The Conference agreed further that members
    of the existing committees which are retained should not be dis­
    charged until they are replaced by appointment by the Chief Jus­
(
                                       44 

tice. The Chief Justice reminded the Conference of his impending
retirement, and suggested that it might be more appropriate to
have the reorganization of the Conference committees made by his
successor. After discussion, on motion the Conference agreed that
the appointments should be made by the present Chief Justice be­
fore he leaves office. The Conference agreed to abolish the follow­
ing committees: the Advisory Committee; the Habeas Corpus
Committee; the Special Committee on the Geographical Organi­
zation of the Courts; the Committees on Judicial Statistics, Sup­
porting Personnel and the Revision of the Laws, the assignments
of which will be carried out by subcommittees of the Committee on
Court Administration; and the Subcommittee on Discovery and
Multiple Litigation of the Committee on Trial Practice and
Technique.
   The Conference agreed that its responsibilities can best be dis­
charged through three types of committees:
   (a) 	General committees serving overall requirements of the Conference
       with broadly based membership and operating in a coordinating capac­
        ity for one or more subcommittees as required ;
   (b) Standing committees 	with smaller membership serving a specific need
        of the Conference; and
   (c) Special committees appointed for 	a specific limited purpose with ten­
        ure of no more than two years unless extended by the Conference.
  The Conference voted that three general committees should be
established:
    (a) 	A Committee on Court Administration, with subcommittees on statis­
         tics, on judicial salaries, annuities and tenure; on supporting personnel
         of the courts and on federal jurisdiction, as well as such other subcom­
         mittees as it may determine;
    (b) 	A Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law with sub­
         committees as it may determine;
    (c) 	A Committee on the Operation of the Jury System with such sub­
         committees as it may determine.
  The following standing committees were created by the Con­
ference:
    (a) 	A Committee on the Budget;
    (b) A Committee on ,the Administration of the Bankruptcy System;
    (c) 	A Committee on the Administration of the Probation System;
    (d) 	A Committee on Intercircuit Assignments: and
    (e) 	A Committee on Trial Practice and Technique.
  The Conference voted further that there should be a Special
Committee on the Implementation of the Criminal Justice Act to
                                            45 

     serve until September 1969, at which time the Conference would
     reexamine the need for the continuation of this special committee.
(       The Conference adopted the following guidelines for the opera­
     tion of its committees:
         (a) 	That general committees normally have a member from each circuit
               and that standing committees and special committees should have seven
               members, at least four of whom should be district court judges;
         (b) 	That as a district judgc becomes a circuit judge, he should submit his
               resignation;
         (c) 	That, exeept as the Chief Justice may deem desirable for special reasons,
               no judge should serve on more than one committee at the same time
               nor should members of the Board of the Federal Judicial Center or
              judges designated to serve on the Multidistrict Litigation Panel serve
               as members of Conference committees during their terms of office on
               the Board or on the Panel;
         (d) 	That all future committee and subcommittee appointments be for terms
              of six years, with members initially appointed for .two-year, four-year
              and six-year terms, and, except as the Chief Justice may otherwise
              determine for special reasons, that the only members who should be
              eligible for reappointment to the same committee would be those orig­
               inally appointed for a two-year term;
         (e) 	That general committees and standing committees be empowered to
               appoint such subcommittees as they may deem necessary, but no judges,
              except m-embers of <the parent oommittee, should be app;)inted 00 any
              subcommi,ttee without the approval of the Chief Justice;
         (f) 	That whenever there is a disagreement between a general committee
(	            and a subcommittee with respect to a matter which is reported to the
              Judicial Conference, such disagreement should also be reported to the
              Judicial Conference :
         (g) 	Where recommended by the chairman of the parent committee, and ap­
              proved by the Chief Justice, the chairman of a subcommittee may report
              in person at a meeting of the Judicial Conference;
         (h) 	That committee and subcommittee meetings be held sufficiently in ad­
              vance of the Judicial Conference meeting to permit proper circulation
              of reports; that, whenever feasible, meetings should be limited to one
              day and that at least one committee meeting a year should be held
              in Washington:
         (i) 	That matters involving financing or application for financing should be
              undertaken only with the prior approval of the Chief Justice or the
              JUdicial Conference.
        The Conference agreed that the staff of the Administrative Of­
     fice should be augmented in order that the Administrative Office
     may perform fully and adequately the staff functions required by
     the Conference committees and subcommittees, including a legis­
     lative reference service. The Conference approved the recommen­
     dation of the Committee that representatives of the Administrative
     Office should attend all committee and subcommittee meetings,
     record the minutes of such meetings and under the guidance of
(
                                  46 


committee chairmen prepare necessary preliminary studies as well
as the drafts of committee reports and any other staff functions
required for the proper implementation of committee work.
   With the acceptance of the report of the Committee on Commit­
tees, the Conference agreed that this Committee had completed its
assigned tasks and the Committee was discharged.

                JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
   The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Chief Judge
William J. Campbell, presented his Committee's report. Judge
Campbell reported that the Congress for fiscal year 1968 appropri­
ated for the judiciary (exclusive of the Supreme Court) the sum of
$92,574,000. The cost of operating the courts, including the Admin­
istrative Office and the Federal Judicial Center, aggregated
$92,116,000, leaving an unobligated balance of only $458,000 to be
returned to the Treasury-less than one-half of one percent of the
total obligationa,l authority. Judge Campbell stated that the budget
estimates for the judiciary (exclusive of the Supreme Court) for
fiscal year 1969, as submitted to the Congress in January 1968, were
in the total amount of $98,066,000. Subsequently, the estimates
were amended to include $538,000 for the Federal Judicial Center
and $6,395,000 to implement the Jury Selection and Service Act
of 1968. Of this total, the Congress actually appropriated $100,425,­
500. The appropriation bill for fiscal 1969 provides for the appoint­
ment of 55 additional law clerks by circuit judges. The Congress,
however, denied requests for 12 deputy clerks for the courts of
appeals and 83 deputy clerks for the district courts, as well as re­
quests for 33 stenographers for the courts of appeals, 97 additional
full-time clerical positions for referees in bankruptcy and 12 posi­
tions for the Administrative Office. The appropriations act allowed
$4,000,000 for the fees of jurors and $300,000 for the Judicial
Center.
   Judge Campbell reported further that on August 20, 1968 a re­
quest for supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1969 was
submitted to the Bureau of the Budget. This supplemental request
included $623,000 to cover the cost of nine additional circuit judges
to be appointed pursuant to Public Law 90-347, enacted June 18,
1968, and $1,341,000 required in connection with the Jury Selection
and Service Act of 1968. The sum of $24,000 was included for the
Administrative Office to cope with an increased workload.
                                     47 

       The Conference approved the Budget Committee's recommenda­
    t,ions for fiscal year 1970 which, exclusive of the United States
(   Supreme Court and the United States Customs Court, aggregated
    $111,242,000, an increase of $10,171,000 over the amounts appro­
    priated for 1969, adjusted to reflect proposed supplementals for pay
    costs. The budget for 1970 provides for the additional circuit
    judges created by the act of June 18, 1968 and the staffing for those
    judges, as well as for the employment of 33 stenographers and 36
    deputy clerks for the courts of appeals, 205 deputy clerks for the
    district courts and 24 additional positions for the Administrative
    Office. The budget also provides for implementation of the actions
    of the Conference at this meeting with respect to new referee posi­
    tions, changes in salaries and arrangements for existing referees, for
    14 clerical positions to staff new referees' offices and those being
    converted from a part-time to a full-time status and 18 clerical
    positions for established referees' offices. The sum of $800,000 is
    included to cover the cost of liberalized classification standards
    for law clerks and $250,000 for liberalized classification standards
    for crier-law clerks.
       The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
    Office to submit to the Congress a request for supplemental appro­
(   priations for pay costs and other supplemental appropriations for
    fiscal year 1969 as may be necessary. The Conference further ap­
    proved the budget estimates for fiscal year 1970 and authorized the
    Director of the Administrative Office to amend the budget esti­
    mates for 1970, as necessary by reason of the enatJtment of the
    Federal Magistrates Bill and other pending legislation and for any
    purpose which could not be anticipated at the time of the Com­
    mittee report.
                          JUDICIAL STATISTICS

      Judge Harvey M. Johnsen, Chairman of the Committee on
    Judicial Statistics, presented the report of the Committee.
                              PENDING CASES

      The Conference approved the Committee recommendation that
    an immediate and concerted effort be made in every circuit and
    district to dispose promptly of all criminal cases pending over one
    year, excluding those involving fugitives or defendants otherwise
    unavailable for trial. The Conference directed the Director of the
(        323-891-68---8
                                 48 

Administrative Office to communicate with the Attorney General
concerning the expedition of the criminal cases pending in the dis­
trict courts and the Conference urged the circuit councils to give
early consideration to this growing problem. The Committee had
pointed out that in 1968 criminal cases pending in all districts in­
creased another nine percent to a record of 14,763 cases, double the
number pending ten years ago. More than 2,000 criminal cases
other than fugitive cases were pending on district court dockets
more than a year as of June 30, 1968.
   Civil cases pending more than three years rose from 5,546 at the
end of 1963 to 8,241 pending a.t the end of 1968. The Conference
adopted the Committee recommendation that the circuit councils
and district courts take all steps necessary to reverse this trend and
to reduce the backlog of these cases.
             STATISTICS IN THE CoURTS OF ApPEALS

   The Conference reaffirmed its previous position that cross­
appeals and other multiparty appeals should be separately docketed
and separately counted statistically, both as a matter of sound
docketing practice in relation to procedures and the collection of
docketing fees and also in the assurance of comparability in sta­
tistical comparison. The Conference agreed with the Committee
that in the case of a joint notice of appeal there would be only one
appeal but each party is entitled to file his own separate notice of
appeal and to raise questions not raised by other parties in which
instances there are separate appeals deserving of separate docketing
and consideration. The Conference also agreed that with regard
to separate but related appeals which may be consolidated for pur­
poses of argument or opinion, docket entries should be made only
in the principal case with an appropriate cross reference on the
other docket sheets so that all documents can be kept in one file
and the impact on the workload of the clerk's office be kept to a
minimum.
   With regard to a request that a uniform method of processing
prisoner petitions in the courts of appeals be considered, the Con­
ference agreed with the Committee recommendation that each
court of appeals once again review its docketing procedures and
undertake to conform them to the procedures prescribed by the
Conference in March 1964 (Conf. Rept., p. 38), at which time the
Conference directed that there be maintained in the clerk's office
                                      49 


    of the courts of appeals, in addition to the present docket, another
    record book entitled "Miscellaneous Record."
                          ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

       Judge Johnsen reported that the Committee had received com­
    munications from the Chief Judges of the Fourth and Sixth Cir­
    cuits recommending additional circuit judgeships in these circuits.
    'll1e Committee had also received a letter from the Chief Judge of
    the First Circuit outlining a prospective need for the addition of a
    circuit judgeship on a projection basis but containing no definitive
    recommendation. Judge Johnsen advised the Conference that the
    Committee had reviewed with care the situation in these courts and
    several other circuits in which the level of case filings in 1968 is
    arguably larger in workload than it should soundly be, even dis­
    counting prisoner petitions which are a significant part of the case­
    load in some circuits, particularly the Fourth. The Committee
    pointed out, however, and the Conference agreed that only within
    the past few months Congress has enacted a bill authorizing nine
    new circuit judgeships, and 10 additional circuit judgeships were
    authorized only two years ago. Additionally, there is an unevalu­
    ated factor in the courts of appeals, namely, the impact which a
(   second law clerk for each judge may have on the capacity of the
    courts to sustain a higher level of case dispositions per judge. The
    Conference, accordingly, agreed to defer consideration of additional
    circuit judgeships at this time.
       Judge Johnsen advised the Conference that the Committee had
    made a full and comprehensive review and survey of all of the dis­
    trict courts. Four years have elapsed since the Committee's last
    general survey of district judgeship needs and although many re­
    quests for additional judgeships have arisen on an emergency basis
    during these four years, none of the situations was found to be so
    critical as to require emergency action. Judge Johnsen stated that
    the Committee had studied the nature and extent of the accumu­
    lation of cases, the rate of attrition in the build-up of the backlog,
    the rate of dispositions as a matter of overa.ll judicial performance
    as an aspect of the ability of the court to cope with its caseload, the
    trends in case filings and the comparative weighted caseload per
    judgeship with the awareness that the weighted caseload requires
    revision. In recognition of the policy of reviewing judgeship needs
    once every four years, the Committee also included as a delibera­
                                     50 

tive element a factor of projection. These factors, Judge Johnsen
stated, considered in the light of the recommendations of the judi­
cial councils of the circuits and the individual district courts fused          (
themselves into what the Committee considered to be the demon­
strably justifiable needs for judgeships in the district courts now
and in the next four years, except as extraordinary developments
may occur in some individual situations.
   The Committee recommended and the Conference approved the
recommendations for additional judgeships in the district courts
as follows:

       In light of the recommendations approved by the Conference,
     the Conference disapproved at this time two pending bills, H.R.
     19019 which would provide two additional judgeships for the
(	   Fourth Circuit and S. 2905 which would provide two judgeships for
     the Sixth Circuit.
                         COURT ADMINISTRATION
      Judge John Biggs, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on Court
     Administration, presented the Committee's report.
                         JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT

        Judge Biggs reported to the Conference that pursuant to the au­
     thority given to the Committee at the March 1967 meeting (Conf.
     Rept., p. 15) to propose revisions to the Judicial Survivors Annuity
     Act, the Committee and members of the staff of the Administrative
     Office have had under consideration drafts of bills designed to bring
     the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act into line with the Civil Service
     Retirement Act; in particular, with those provisions relating to
     members of Congress.
        Judge Biggs presented to the Conference for its preliminary con­
     sideration a draft bill which the Conference approved, in principle,
(
                                  52 

which would achieve this result. He advised the Conference that the
proposed bill has not been approved at this time in all respects
either by the Civil Service Commission or by the Senate Subcom­
mittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery. He advised that
the Committee would keep the proposed draft under study and
would bring it to the Conference for formal approval when it is in
substantially final form.

                INSPECTION OF JUDICIAL RECORDS

  Judge Biggs reported that the Comptroller General of the United
States conferred with the Committee in an effort to effect on site
inspection of records of various judicial offices of the United States
courts. The Comptroller General advised that he has this duty by
law but up to the present has been able to discharge this function
only at the seat of government. The Committee recommended and
the Conference approved the recommendation that the Director of
the Administrative Office enter into an agreement with the General
Accounting Office for the proposed on site inspection of court
records on a nationwide basis.

                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  Judge Biggs advised the Conference that his Committee was in
agreement with the recommendation of the Committee on Judicial
Statistics which the Conference had approved for the creation of
additional district court judgeships. The Committee on Court Ad­
ministration had differed from the Committee on Judicial Statistics
only with respect to the six judgeships recommended for the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia. Judge Biggs'
Committee would favor making these judgeships temporary until
a determination had been reached as to whether local criminal
cases would be transferred to some other court. In view of the prior
approval by the Conference of the report on judicial statistics, this
point was not pressed.

                    PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

  The Conference approved S. 3263, 90th Congress, and H.R.
16993, 90th Congress, which would provide for the holding of terms
of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon at
                                      53 

    Coquille. The Conference noted that these bills had been approved
    by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.
      The Conference disapproved H.R. 16867 and H.R. 17184, both
    90th Congress, which would provide for the holding of court by the
    United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsyl­
    vania at Easton and Philadelphia or their environs. The Conference
    noted that these bills had also been disapproved both by the judges
    of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and
    by the Judicial Council of the Third Circuit.
              TRANSFER OF AND ELIMINATION OF DIVISIONS

       The Conference approved H.R. 16975, 90th Congress, which
    would transfer Haywood County from the Western to the Eastern
    Division of the Western District of Texas. The Conference noted
    that this proposed bill had also been approved by the Judicial
    Council of the Sixth Circuit.
       The Conference also approved the recommendation of the J udi­
    cial Council of the Ninth Circuit that the divisions of the Eastern
    and Western Districts of Washington and the divisions of the Dis­
    trict of Idaho be eliminated. It approved placing this recommenda­
    tion in the omnibus judgeship bill proposed by the Committee on
    Judicial Statistics and approved by the Conference.
                      MATrERS RELATING TO JUDGES

       Judge Biggs reported to the Conference that S. 3055- had been
    introduced in the Senate by Senator Tydings, Chairman of the
    Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery, and that
    hearings had been held on this proposed bill which is in five titles
    and provides for a national commission to investigate the official
    conduct of any judge, for the retirement of judges, both for age and
    disability, for revisions of the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act, for
    disclosure by judges of financial assets and for the methods of selec­
    tion of chief judges of circuits and districts. Judge Biggs advised
    that Senator Tydings plans to revise S. 3055 in the light of hearings
    that have been conducted and that the revised bill will be intro­
    duced in the 91st Congress along with revisions of S. 3071 and S.
    3061 providing, among other things, for the mandatory retirement
    of judges.
       Judge Biggs advised the Conference that the Committee will
(
                                  54 

continue to consider these bills, as revised, and report to a subse­
quent meeting of the Conference.
                     REVIEW OF I.C.C. ORDERS
   At the February meeting of the Conference (Con£. Rept., p. 12),
the Conference approved S. 2687 which would provide that instead
of review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission by
three-judge district courts, jurisdiction for review of I.C.C. orders
would be placed in the respective United States court of appeals,
thereby eliminating direct appeal to the Supreme Court. Judge
Biggs reported that this bill had now passed the Senate with an
amendment providing that for good cause shown a court of appeals
may extend the time for filing a petition for review for an addi­
tional period not exceeding sixty days. The Conference approved
the bill as amended.
   In response to an inquiry of Chief Judge Harper as to how court
reporters could be procured and paid if a court of appeals required
a hearing with oral testimony on the issue of whether a stay of an
I.C.C. order should be granted, the Conference requested the Chair­
man to take up this question with the Chairman of the Budget
Committee to assure that courts of appeals have an opportunity to
utilize the services of a court reporter not only in such I.C.C. cases
                                                                         (
but whenever they might be needed for purposes of taking
testimony in courts of appeals.
       CoNTRACTS    WITH   PRIVATE REPORTING COMPANIES
  Judge Biggs reported to the Conference that the Director of the
Administrative Office had discussed with the Committee the desir­
ability of enacting a statute to provide that a chief judge of a
district court could enter into a contract with a private reporting
company at rates approved by the Judicial Conference to perform
such reporting duties as may be deemed necessary by the inability
of the court reporters of the court to perform such duties. The
Conference approved the referral of this question to the Committee
on Supporting Personnel for study and recommendation.
                      CoURT REPORTERS ACT
  Judge Biggs advised the C-onference that Judge Hastings, Chair­
man of the Committee on the Implementation of the Criminal
Justice Act, had called to the Committee's attention a proposed
                                            55 

    amendment which would enable Criminal Justice Act defendants to
    obtain the benefits of 28 U.S.C. 753 without the need for additional
    eligibility screening. The amendment would automatically accord
    benefits available under the present statute to the Criminal Justice
    Act as well as to the in forma pauperis pro se appellant thereby
    eliminating the need for a declaration of in forma pauperis status.
    The Conference approved this legislative proposal and a recom­
    mendation that it be enacted by the Congress.
                        OTHER LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

       The Conference considered S. 1195 which would enact the Office
    of Administrative Ombudsman and S. 3123 which would establish
    a two-year study of the Office of Administrative Ombudsman and
    determined that "ince neither of these bills would affect directly
    the administration of the United States Courts, the Conference
    would refrain from expressing an opinion respecting them.
       The Conference disapproved H.R. 15326 which would abolish the
    Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries
    established by Section 225 of the Federal Salary Act of 1967.
        The Conference voted its disapproval of the following legislative

                        NATIONAL FOUNDATION OF LAW
        Judge Biggs advised the Conference that several bills were pend~
     ing which would establish a National Foundation of Law-S. 2602,
     S. 2607 and H.R. 13584.
        The Conference considered H.R. 13584 and voted its disapproval
     of it in its present form. It noted the report of the Chairman that S.
     1033 which would set up within the Department of Justice an Of­
     fice for Judicial Assistance is in the process of being redrafted and
     will be submitted for future Conference consideration.

             COMITTEE ON SUPPORTING PERSONNEL
       Judge Theodore Levin, Chairman of the Committee on Support~
     ing Personnel, presented the Committee's report.

         AnMINISTRATAVE ASSISTANTS                TO   CIRCUIT CHIEF JUDGES
       The Conference affirmed its support of S. 3062 providing for
     the position of administrative assistants to the chief judge of each
I\
                                        58 


of the courts of appeals. This legislation carries out a recommenda­
tion approved by the Conference at its February 1968 meeting
(Conf. Rept., p. 31). The Conference agreed that if the bill is not
passed by the 90th Congress, its reintroduction in the next Con­
gress and its enactment should be vigorously pursued.

                              CoURT REPORTERS

   The Conference reaffirmed its action at the February 1968 meet­
ing (Conf. Rept., p. 31) that Title 28, United States Code, Section
753(e) be amended to eliminate the maximum and minimum limi­
tations upon the annual salary of reporters and to give the Con­
ference the authority to fix salaries of official court reporters.
   The Conference noted that H.R. 16805 had been introduced in
the 90th Congress in pursuance of this recommendation. The Con­
ference agreed that if the bill is not passed in the 90th Congress,
its reintroduction in the 91st Congress should be urged. In order to
afford some relief in the meantime, the Conference agreed with the
Committee recommendation that transcript rates should be in­
creased as follows:
    (1) 	 Daily copy from the present rate of $1.50 per page for the original to
         $2.00 with a flat rate of $.50 per page for each copy after the original;
    (2) 	 Ordinary copy from the present rate of $.90 per page to $1.00 per page
         for original copy. with a flat rate of $.40 per page for each copy after the
         original.
   The Conference considered and disapproved a request from the
Chief Judge of the Northern District of California for an addi­
tional court reporter, noting that the court now has eight active
judges and that eight reporters are authorized.

  Judge Levin reported that he had requested the chief judge of
each of the courts of appeals to submit a projection of the require­
ments of his court for a five-year period. He also noted that while
the Congress had appropriated sufficient funds to permit employ­
ment of a second law clerk for each active circuit judge who had
requested such assistance, the appropriation for fiscal year 1969
did not provide for any additional deputy clerks or additional secre­
tarial assistance for the courts of appeals. The Conference there­
upon approved the Committee recommendation reaffirming prior
Conference decisions communicated on two occasions to the Con­
                                       59 


gress for the authorization of 33 secretarial positions for the courts
of appeals, together with the necessary appropriations to cover
these positions. The Conference also authorized the request for 36
additional deputy clerk positions in the courts of appeals.
  The Conference agreed with the Committee action in disapprov­
ing requests for mes.sengers for the courts of appeals, noting the
action of the Conference at the September 1967 meeting (Conf.
Rept., p. 83) that no additional messenger positions should be
sought and should a second law clerk be authorized for each cir­
cuit judge, no replacement would be made of the existing messen­
ger position for the judge receiving such additional law clerk.
                 LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY FACILITIES

   Judge Levin reported that he had conferred with Judge Biggs,
Chairman of the Committee on Court Administration, concerning
the need for a study of central libraries existing in various federal
courthouses. As a result, the Committee recommended and the
Conference approved the recommendation that the Director of the
Federal Judicial Center be consulted as to whether the Center
might find it appropriate to undertake a complete study of the li­
braries, librarians and related matters and if the Center is unable
to undertake the responsibility, the Committee, in cooperation
with the Committee on Court Administration and the Adminstra­
tive Office, should engage the services of professional assistance and
request an appropriation for that purpose. Pending a resolution of
this matter, the Conference agreed that consideration of grades for
librarians and assistant librarians be deferred.

                   SALARY LIMITS FOR LAW CLlllRKS

  Judge Levin reported that his Committee had undertaken a
comprehensive survey of recently adopted salary schedules for law
graduates eligible for law clerk positions. As a result, the Com­
mittee recommended to the Conference and the Conference ap­
proved an increase in JSP grades for law clerks, secretary-law
clerks and crier-law clerks, as follows:

  The Conference further authorized the Chairman of the Budget
Committee to seek a supplemental appropriation for the purpose
of these increased grades and determined that such increases should
take effect immediately upon receiving the supplemental appro­
                                  61 

priation and be made available to present law clerks as well as to
those subsequently appointed. The Conference also agreed that if
the additional appropriation is obtained, the statutory limitation
on the combined salaries of secretaries and law clerks should be in­
creased accordingly.
         PERSONNEL FOR DISTRICT COURT CLERKS' OFFICES

  Judge Levin advised the Conference that the Jury Reform and
Selection Act of 1968 will add to the burdens of the clerks' offices in
the district courts. These clerks' offices are already heavily burdened
because of other factors, particularly the increases in filings of
prisoner petitions. Judge Levin noted that a supplemental appro­
priation request has been submitted to the Congress which would
provide for 166 deputy clerks to implement the Jury Selection and
Service Act of 1968. The Conference authorized the Director of the
Administrative Office and the Budget Committee to review the
action taken on the supplemental appropriation and in light
thereof to make such adjustments as may be necessary in the num­
ber of new deputy clerk positions requested for fiscal year 1970.
            QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROBATION OFFICERS

   At the present time the Judicial Salary Plan includes minimum
qualification standards for the appointment of probation officers
requiring that the appointee possess a college degree and that he
have either two years of experience in personnel work for the wel­
fare of others or two years of specialized graduate training or spe­
cific combinations of experience and advance training. The
standards, however, provide further that any other qualifications
are acceptable if in the opinion of the appointing judge they are
equivalent to the combination of experience and advance training
specified in the plan. The Conference agreed to amend the Judicial
Salary Plan with respect to qualifications for appointment of pro­
bation officers so as to provide that in lieu of specific requirements
of advance training and experience, the appointee may possess
qualifications which in the opinion of the appointing judge and the
Director of the Administrative Office, subject to review by the
appropriate committee of the Conference, are equivalent to those
specified in the plan.
                                     62 

                              INTERPRETERS 

  The Conference authorized the establishment of the position
of interpreter in Grade JSP 5 ($5,732 per annum) for the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

              COURT REPORTER-SECRETARY POSITIONS
   The Conference approved the request of Chief Judge Guthrie F.
Crowe of the United States Court for the Canal Zone to divide his
present combination position of court reporter-secretary into two
separate positions. The Conference authorized the Judge of the
District Court of Guam to divide his present combination position
of court reporter-secretary into two positions.

                   NATIONAL PARK CoMMISSIONER
  The Conference noted and approved a request of the Chief Judge
of the Western District of Kentucky that the annual salary of the
commissioner in Monmouth Cave National Park be increased from
$1,000 to $2,000. In so doing, the Conference noted that the annual
salary of this position had at one time been $3,000 but because
of reduced caseload the court had requested a salary reduction to
$1,000. The Conference noted that the court is now of the view that
the caseload has developed to the point where the position should
properly be raised to $2,000.

                EXPENSES OF JURY COMMISSIONERS
  In execution of the statutory responsibility to establish schedules
for expenses of jury commissioners, the Conference agreed­
   (a) 	Inasmuch as there is no provision for clerical assistance or office ex­
       penses for jury commissioners, all necessary assistance should be pro­
       vided by the respective clerks of court;
   (b) 	Necessary travel and subsistence should be paid in accordance with
                                                                                  1
                                                                                  .
        Government Travel Regulations. These regulations now govern the
       travel and subsistence of supporting personnel and should apply to jury
       commissioners.

        RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
  Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing Committee Oft..­
Rules of Practice and Procedure, reported on the work of the
Committee and its advisory committees.
                                 63 

   Judge Maris stated that the Chief Justice has appointed Profes­
sor Bernard J. Ward, former reporter to the Advisory Committee
on Appellate Rules, as reporter to the standing Committee.
   He noted that the Committee on Appellate Rules has completed
its assignment and that the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure
have gone into effect as of July 1,1968. The advisory committee has
been discharged and any suggestions relating to the appellate rules
will be considered by the standing Committee.
   Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules
is continuing to receive comments and suggestions from the bench
and bar on the tentative draft of revised discovery rules which was
published in November 1967. The final date for comments is Janu­
ary 1, 1969 and soon thereafter the Committee hopes to complete
its consideration of the suggestions and comments and to present
a tentative draft to the standing Committee in the spring of 1969.
   The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is continuing to
study those phases of criminal procedure on which it has not hereto­
fore reported, particularly, the arraignment and other pretrial
procedures.
   The Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules, with the assist­
ance of its newly appointed reporter, Professor Preble Stolz, is
giving consideration to the operation of the unified civil rules with
respect to maritime cases and is also studying the supplemental
admiralty rules with a view to their improvement and enlargement,
if needed.
   The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules is continuing
its work. Professor Lawrence P. King and Professor Vern Country­
man have been appointed associate reporters of the committee to
work with Professor Kennedy who is in general charge of the work.
   The Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence is preparing a
tentative draft of uniform rules of evidence which it hopes to have
ready for publication and public discussion early in 1969.
       INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES
  The report of the Advisory Committee on Intercircuit Assign­
ments was presented by the Committee Chairman, Judge Jean S.
Breitenstein.
  Judge Breitenstein advised that the Committee has recom­
mended 28 assignments in the period from February 9, 1968 to
September 6,1968, the assignments to be undertaken by 24 judges.
                                 64 

One senior circuit judge accepted three assignments but for per­
sonal reasons will be unable to fulfill two of them. Two other senior
circuit judges each accepted two assignments but because of cal­
endaring problems, the service of one of them will not be needed
at the designated time.
   The Chief Justice approved all assignments recommended by the
Committee except two to district courts in which unusual condi­
tions developed after the Committee made its recommendations.
   Eight senior judges accepted intercircuit assignments.
   Judge Breitenstein pointed out that special programs designed
                                                                            I
to clear heavy dockets appeared to be increasing in number. The
evaluation of such programs and the recruitment of the necessary
judges present perplexing questions. The Committee interprets its
                                                                            i
                                                                            'I
instructions from the Conference to give it no freedom to evaluate          I
such programs or to determine priorities between programs
competing for the available judgepower.
  Judge Breitenstein reviewed the work of the Committee in the
period from March 11, 1960 to September 6, 1968. During that
period the Committee recommended 432 assignments. Of these,
69 were undertaken by senior circuit judges and 81 by senior district
judges. The two circuits contributing the most judges in active
service for intercircuit assignments were the Ninth with 45 and         (
the Eighth with 31. The two circuits contributing the fewest active
judges for intercircuit assignments were the Seventh with five and
the Third with 10. The two circuits to which the greatest number
of assignments were made were the Fifth with 113 and the Second
with 67. The two circuits to which the least number of assignments
were made were the Eighth with three and the Fourth with four.
About 35 percent of the assignments were made to courts of
appeals and 65 percent to district courts.
  In evaluating the work of the Committee, Judge Breitenstein
pointed out that the evaluation of intercircuit assignments on the
basis of trials and trial days is not realistic and may be misleading
because it neither includes nor reflects the large amount of im­
portant judicial work done in addition to trials. Nevertheless, he
asserted, such statistical evaluation is significant. For the past
ten-year period the average cost per trial conducted by a judge
assigned from without a circuit was $250 and the average per trial
day was $114. According to the reports of the Administrative
Office, the annual recurring cost of one district judgeship is
                                        65 

$84,900. For a cost 5.25 times that amount, inrercircuit assign­
ments resulted in 1,784 trials consuming 3,901 trial days. If a
trial judge would work 200 days a year trying cases, the cost per
trial day on the basis of the annual recurring cost of a district
judgeship would be $424. This compares with $114 per trial day
on inrercircuit assignments.
   Judge Breitenstein advised the Conference that he had testified
before the Senare Subcommitree on Improvements in Judicial
Machinery on the subject matter of intercircuit assignments. He
also quoted from a recent report of the American Bar Foundation
which states that "fuller utilization of temporary inrercircuit
assignments can be made within the present circumstances."
   Judge Breirensrein concluded on behalf of the Committee that
it is their view that the statistics indicate that intercircuit assign­
ments play an important and valuable role in the operation of
the federal judicial system. The present system, however, operares
largely on an ad hoc personal arrangement basis. Such a sysrem can
not and will not produce the most advantageous use of judicial
personnel. In view of these circumstances, the Committee made six
recommendations to the Conference, all of which were approved
by the Conference, as follows:
   (1) 	Adopt the policy that a federal judge has a responsibility. first, to the
        particular court of which he is a member, second, to the other courts
        within his OWitJ. circuit, and, third, to the courts outside his circuit.
   (2) Except 	for emergency situations, courts in need of help, through the
        chief judge of the circuit, shall forecast that need by at least six months
        and advise the committee of the times and places where help is required
        and of the number of judges desired.
   (3) 	When there are conflicting requests for the available judges, the com·
       mittee shall determine the relative priorities of such requests.
   (4) 	The practice of intercircuit assignments of active judges on a personal
       arrangement basis is not approved.
   (5) 	The committee shall make requests of the Chief Judges of the circuits
       for judges available to respond to requests for help. The results of
       such requests shall be reported to the Conference.
   (6) 	No judge shall be assigned out of his circuit without his consent and,
       in the case of active judges only, without the consent of the Chief Judge
       of his circuit.
   Judge Breitenstein stared that the Advisory Committee on Inter­
circuit Assignments functions on a continuing basis in view of the
nature of its assignment. He stated that because of the recom­
mendations of the Committee on Commitrees which the Conference
had adopted which calls for the reorganization of committee
                                 66 

structure, the Advisory Committee has refrained from making rec­
ommendations except as to senior judges on assignments scheduled
to begin after January 1, 1969. The Conference directed the Com­
mittee to continue to function as it has, without reference to any
cut-off date, until such time as the committee membership is re­
placed. Any assignments made by the present committee which
are approved by the Chief Justice shall not be subject to re-review
by a newly organized committee.
           OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman of the Committee on the
Operation of the Jury System, presented the report of the
Committee.
                     PREJUDICIAL PUBLICITY

   At the prior meeting of the Conference in February 1968 (Conf.
Rept. p. 16), Judge Kaufman presented to the Conference the re­
port of the subcommittee which had been charged with preparing
guidelines or taking other corrective action to assure federal juries
from prejudicial publicity in light of the Supreme Court decision in
Shepherd v. Maxwell, 348 U.S. 333. The Conference at that time
agreed to accept the report for study, to circulate it immediately      (
to all federal judges and to release it to the news media with the
request that all comments and suggestions be made prior to July 1,
1968. In accordance with the Conference's instructions, Judge
Kaufman reported that the responses received as a result of the
February action of the Conference were generally enthusiastic over
the report, as written, and that an overwhelming number expressed
views most favorable to all its recommendations. Views were re­
ceived from 58 individual judges (writing for themselves and not
the court), of whom 46 fully approved the report and 12 approved
in part or with some relatively minor qualification or suggestion.
Three courts totaling 24 judges also appoved the report in part or
with similar qualifications or suggestions. Some individual com­
ments proposed the extension of the recommendation to encompass
additional subjects not covered in the report or more stringent re­
straints on the press. In addition, the First, Fourth, Fifth and
Eighth Circuit Conference each approved the report by a total of
118 judges in favor with 32 opposed. The Sixth Circuit Conference
                                       67 

permitted nonjudicial members to vote with the judges of the
circuit. The report was there approved by a narrow margin.
  Judge Kaufman advised that the Committee had made some
changes in the report that was circulated after the February meet­
ing. The Conference approved the report as amended and author­
ized its immediate release.
                  JURY SELECTION AND SERVICE              ACT
   Following the action of the Conference at its February 1968
session (Conf. Rept., p. 16), the Committee undertook the task of
preparing guidelines to assist the district courts in conforming to
the requirements of the new legislation. These guidelines were pre­
pared and distributed to all federal judges and district court clerks.
The members of the Committee and the Administrative Office have
also attempted to assist the district courts in the preparation of
their plans which are required by the Jury Selection and Service
Act of 1968.
   Judge Kaufman stated that the Committee had considered the
district jury plans which describe as a daily compensation for jury
commissioners a daily rate within the statutory maximum without
specifying any pro rata amount of compensation for a period of
service of less than the usual 8-hour day, and with respect there­
to the Committee had drafted for Conference action the following
resolution:
     Be U resolved, That in respect to those district jury plans which have
   described as the daily compensation of citizen jury commissioners a daily
   rate within 'the statutory maximum without specifying any pro rata amount
   of compensation for a period of service of less than the usual Sob-our day, such
   provision shall be interpreted to mean that the jury commissioner shall be
   compensated at a prorated amount for any period of less than 8 hours in any
   given work day.
     Be it further resolved, That the Administrative Office be instructed to
   take whatever steps are necessary to prepare and distribute an appropriate
   voucher for jury commissioners in lieu of the present version of AO Form 60.
   The Conference approved the foregoing resolution of the
Committee.
   Judge Kaufman also stated that the Committee had distributed
a form of questionnaire and related documents to be sent to the
prospective juror as part of the guidelines. After evaluating the
comments received on this questionnaire form and revising it in the
light of those comments, the Committee presented the question~
                                   68 

naire for Conference action and the Conference approved the Juror
Qualification Questionnaire as presented to it.                           (   ,

           PILOT STUDY ON UTILIZATION OF JUROR TIME

   At the September 1966 session of the Conference the Conference
authorized the Chairman to cooperate with the Institute of Judi­
cial Administration in a study of the possible use of data com­
puters for court administration, specifically including a pilot study
of the possibility of the use of computers for the administration of
the jury system in order to achieve a more accurate prediction of
the jury requirements and to reduce costs (Conf. Rept., p. 57).
   Judge Kaufman reported that he has been able to utilize the
facilities and resources of the American Bar Foundation which has
assigned a research attorney to undertake the pilot project which
is now under way in the Western District of Missouri.

   ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Pro­
bation System was presented by the Committee's Chairman, Chief
Judge Walter E. Hoffman.

                      SENTENCING INSTITUTE

  At the February 1968 session the Conference approved the plans
of the District of Columbia Circuit for holding a sentencing insti­
tute in the fall of 1968 (Conf. Rept., p. 30). Judge Hoffman
presented the proposed agenda for the institute to be held Novem­
ber 22-23, 1968 for Conference consideration and the Conference
voted its approval of the proposed agenda.

           BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION OF ApPOINTEES

   Judge Hoffman advised that it has been the practice for many
years for the Administrative Office to request the Attorney General
for a background investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investiga­
tion of each person appointed to the position of probation officer.
Judge Hoffman stated that his Committee had taken note of the
fact that each district court relies not only on the performance of its
own probation officers but on the performance of the entire proba­
tion system. It is a rare occasion when a presentence investigation
can be completed for any court without the probation officer calling
                                  69 

into action the probation officer in one or more other districts.
Because of the mobility of our population, a person placed on pro­
bation in one district is likely to be supervised during the course of
his probation in one or several other districts. The character of a
person appointed as a probation officer is of concern not only to the
court making the appointment but to every court in the federal
establishment.
   Judge Hoffman stated that since the policy of the Director of the
Administrative Office requesting background investigations of ap­
pointees had begun when the Probation Division was part of the
Department of Justice, the Judicial Conference had never formally
approved this policy with respect to the investigation of the back­
ground of each person appointed to what is clearly a sensitive
position. The Conference instructed the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office to continue this policy and to arrange for a full
investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the back­
ground of every proposed appointee. The Conference further urged
that district courts should wherever feasible have such investiga­
tion accomplished prior to appointment.
                      DEFERRED PROSECUTION

   Judge Hoffman reported that the Committee's study of deferred
prosecution and the plan for preprosecution probation was con­
tinuing but the Committee was of the view that the ramifications
of this subject was such as to require more extensive study than can
be afforded by anyone committee of the Conference. The Olairman
requested and the Conference granted him leave to discuss with the
Director of the Federal Judicial Center the matter of deferred
prosecution with a view toward the possibility of a study, in depth,
of this problem by the Center.
      ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  Judge George C. Edwards, Jr., Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.
         PERSONS ACQUITTED ON GROUNDS OF INSANITY

  Judge Edwards advised the Conference that a subcommittee
was studying the bills now before the Congress providing for the
commitment of persons acquitted on the grounds of insanity. He
                                 70 


reminded the Conference that at the September 1967 meeting he
had discussed S. 1007 and that the Conference had reaffirmed its
approval of the principle of the proposed legislation (Conf. Rept.,
p. 79). The subcommittee requested further time for the study of
the pending bills and of a draft version of a proposed bill prepared
by the Administrative Office. The Conference expressed its agree­
ment with the request for further time in which to study this
subject for report to the Conference at its next session.
                        BAIL REFORM     ACT
   Several additional bills have been introduced in the 90th Con­
gress, Judge Edwards reported, relating to problems which have
arisen in the administration of the Bail Reform Act. These bills
have all been referred to a suooommittee chaired by Judge Chilson
for a comprehensive study to be b8.'3ed on the experiences both of
federal judges and of the Department of Justice in the administra­
tion of the Act. The conference expressed its agreement with such
a study and deferred consideration of any of the pending legislative
proposals at this time.
                   FEDERAL MAGISTRATES BILL
                                                                       (
   Judge Edwards advised the Conference that the Federal Magis­
trates Bill previously approved by the Conference (Conf. Rept.,
March 1967, pp. 38-40) had p8.'3sed the Senate in substantially the
form approved by the Conference and was pending in the House of
Representatives. He stated that the House Judiciary Committee
had amended the bill in certain minor respects but had iP'feserved
all of its major features.
   The Conference expressed its approval with the House amend­
ments and directed that an appropriate communication of its action
be transmitted to the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary
of the House of Representatives.
                         CIVIL DISORDERS

  The Conference was advised that the Committee has been con­
cerned with the serious problem that h8.'3 faced the administration
of justice in areas of riots or civil disorders. The problems of ac­
cording accused persons prompt release proceedings and prelimi­
nary hearings and of assigning counsel where necessary placed a
severe strain on the judicial machinery.                               (
                                 71 


   The conference noted that the area of possible federal jurisdic­
tion in respect to civil disorder emergencies has recently been ex­
tended by the provisions of Title I and Title X of Public Law
90-284. The Conference, therefore, directed that this problem be
brought to the attention of the Federal Judicial Center as a possible
a,rea of study.

COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
                   ACT
   Judge John S. Hastings, Chajrman of the Committee to Imple­
ment the Criminal Justice Act, presented the Committee's report
to the Conference.
                  ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   Judge Hastings presented to the Conference the report of the
Administrative Office on appointments and payments under the
Criminal Justice Act through June 30, 1968. This report reflects
that the Administrative Office during fiscal year 1968 received
25,334 orders appointing counsel under the Criminal Justice Act.
Because other orders of appointment made prior to June 30 will be
received by the Administrative Office during the early months of
fiscal year 1969, these figures can not be regarded as final. For the
same reason, cost figures for fiscal year 1968 are not final.
   During 1968 the Administrative Office paid vouchers submitted
under the Criminal Justice Act in the aggregate amount of $3,887,­
266. The district courts during 1968 authorized investigative, ex­
pert and other contractual services estimated to cost $83,116. The
chief judges of the courts of appeals approved 24 claims for
protracted representations during the year.
   After considering the report of the Administrative Office, the
Conference authorized the Director to distribute copies of the
report to all federal judges, as well as to the Chief Judge of the
District of Columbia Court of General Sessions and to the Chief
Judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
                    STATUTORY AMENDMENTS

  At the February meeting of the Conference Judge Hastings ad­
vised of the completion of the survey report on the operation of the
Act undertaken by the University of Chicago School of Law under
the direction of Professor Dallin Oaks (Conf. Rept., p. 25). Judge
                                 72 

Hastings stated to the Conference that the subcommittee chaired
by Judge Harvey M. Johnsen had now made a thorough study of
the Oaks' report and had met on several occasions with representa­
tives of the Department of Justice to consider methods of meeting
the suggestions and criticisms made in the Oaks' report as well as
to comply with the mandate of the Congressional Conference
Committee that the Department of Justice, in collaboration with
the Judicial Conference, shall report to the Congress on the merits
of an assigned counsel system as compared with a public defender
system.
   Since the Department of Justice is not yet ready to make a final
determination on the comparative merits of the two systems and
since Judge Hastings' Committee shares this position, the Confer­
ence authorized the Committee to continue its study, in collabora­
tion with the Department of Justice, in the expectation that a final
report may be ready for consideration in 1969.
   Judge Hastings referred to the Conference action in 1967 (Conf.
Rept., p. 78) at which the Conference took cognizance of the many
expressions of opinion from many parts of the country that the
Criminal Justice Act should be amended to include representation
of defendants in post conviction and ancillary matters, including
habeas corpus, Section 2255 and revocation of probation proceed­       (   i

ings. Judge Hastings stated that the subcommittee had completed
its study and recommendations of proposed amendments to the
Criminal Justice Act and Judge Hastings presented these proposed
amendments to the Conference. These amendments specifically
bring within the purview of the Act probation revocation proceed­
ings; they provide for the possibility of compensation of counsel
appointed from the approved panel who may have represented a
defendant after arrest but prior to arraignment; they specifically
include defender organizations as well as legal aid agencies; they
provide for compensation to counsel for representation in ancillary
matters appropriate to the proceedings; they recommend an in­
crease in the rate of compensation in the light of the present price
structure without altering the basic principle of the Act that the
rates should not be compensatory in the normal sense and they
increase the maximum amount which may be paid for representa­
tion. They include the costs of transcripts authorized by the court
as a reimbursable expense and they provide a different standard for
excess payments approved by the chief judge of the circuit. They
                                                                       (
                                  73 

extend the excess payment provision to appellate proceedings and
the use of expert services. The amendments also provide for com­
pensation to assigned counsel when a full-scale evidentiary hearing
is required in connection with representation in habeas corpus
and Section 2255 matters.
   After consideration of the proposed amendments, the Conference
voted approval thereof and directed transmission of these amend­
ments to the Congress and the Attorney General.

                            GUIDELINES

   The Conference agreed with the recommendation of the Com­
mittee that sufficient experience has now been gained in the opera­
tion of the Act to make it feasible to prepare guidelines in the
administration of the Act for the use of judges, clerks of court
and commissioners. The Conference noted that the Chairman of
the Committee had appointed a subcommittee to study and prepare
such guidelines.
              NARCOTIC ADDICT REHABILITATION ACT

   The Conference noted that Titles I, II and III of the Narcotic
Addict Rehabilitation Act provide for the appointment of coun­
sel. Since Title I and Title II cases are criminal in nature, the Con­
ference was of the view that such cases already fall within the
coverage of the Criminal Justice Act. Section 313 of Title III
of the Act provides that counsel assigned by the court in civil com­
mitment proceedings shall be entitled to reasonable compensa­
tion in an amount to be determined by the court and to be paid
upon order of the court out of such funds as may be provided by
law. The Conference was of the view that civil commitment pro­
ceedings under Title III do not properly belong within the purview
of the Criminal Justice Act but that courts should be guided in fix­
ing compensation under Title III by the rates established by the
Criminal Justice Act. The Conference also agreed that courts
should follow the format of orders used under the Criminal Justice
Act in Title III cases.
             BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
  Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman of the Committee on the Ad­
ministration of the Bankruptcy System, presented the Committee's
report.
                                         74 


   Judge Weinfeld stated that the Committee had considered the
recommendations in the survey report of the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Office, dated June 25, 1968, and in the supplemental
survey report, dated July 12, 1968. These reports recommend the
continuance of referee positions to become vacant by expiration of
term, for changing one part-time position to a full-time position,
for the creation of one additional part-time position and for the
discontinuance of certain designated places of holding bankruptcy
court. These recommendations which had been approved by the
district courts and circuit councils concerned were approved by the
Conference, with the changes to become effective October 1, 1968,
unless otherwise stated, as follows:

        regular place of office, territory and places of holding court to remain
        as at present.
   Judge Weinfeld stated that bankruptcy surveys were conducted
in six additional districts at the request of the judges or referees of
such districts and that the studies made by the Bankruptcy Divi­
sion reveal that recommendations and changes are not justified at
this time. Included in the requests were recommendations for in­
creases in compensation of referees in two districts. The Director
made no recommendation for salary increases in these districts be­
cause of the enactment of the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary
Act of 1967 which contains provisions for the creation of a commis­
sion to review legislative, judicial and executive salaries, including
the salaries of referees in bankruptcy.

                              ApPROPRIATIONS

  Judge Weinfeld stated that the Congress had approved the full
amount of the estimate for referees' salaries for fiscal year 1969
totaling $4,588,000. The amount requested for the expenses of
operating referees' offices, however, w.as reduced from $8,617,000
to $8,200,000. The principal item of reduction was the disallowance
of the request for 97 additional clerical positions for referees' offi­
ces for fiscal year 1969.
  For the first time Congress provided that the expenses of operat­
ing the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office in 1969
be appropriated out of the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund.
Judge Weinfeld noted in this connection that obligations against
the fund have exceeded payments into it for the fiscal years 1966,
1967, and 1968 and that it is anticipated that obligations will again
exceed receipts by a substantial amount in fiscal year 1969.



                                                                                      (
                                  77
                        NEW CASE FILINGS

  In fiscal year 1968 the total number of cases filed was 197,792,
a decline of 10,537 cases or 5.1 percent from 1967. This is the first
year since fiscal year 1952 that the filing of new cases has dropped
below the total of the preceding year and it is only the second time
that this has occurred since World War II.
   In 1968 the proportion of business bankruptcies increased slightly
with respect to the total cases filed although, numerically, there was
a small decline. Non-business filings constituted 91.6 percent of all
of the new bankruptcy filings.

                            LEGISLATION

   The Conference considered and voted its disapproval of S. 2997,
a bill to authorize the waiver of certain fees in bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The Conference considered H.R. 16711, 90th Congress, a bill to
amend Section 57(n) of the Bankruptcy Act. At its September 1967
meeting the Conference had considered and disapprOVed H.R. 2895,
a bill to achieve the same purpose (Conf. Rept., p. 74). At that time
the Conference stated that it was disapproving the legislation be­
cause the provisions were not limited to corporations, no ultimate
time limit was provided as in the present exceptions and the amend­
ment was not restricted to prospective distribution to creditors.
   The Conference noted that the present bill, H.R. 16711, is de­
signed to meet the comments of the Conference made at its Septem­
ber 1967 meeting. The Conference requested the Bankruptcy Divi­
sion to make a thorough analysis of the new proposal and report to
the Conference at its next meeting.

                 AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   The Conference noted that in the audit of statistical reports of
closed asset cases and arraignment proceedings successfully con­
cluded under Chapter XI during the past six months, approxi­
mately 225 inquiries have been made by the Audit Unit. The audit
program continues to reveal more overpayments to the Salary and
Expense Fund than underpayments. The Conference was advised
that statistical report forms for reporting successfully terminated
Chapter XI cases have been revised and simplified with a view to
                                 78 

increasing accuracy of the data reported and expanding the data
supplied to the Bankruptcy Division in these cases.
                                                                       (
                  MATTERS UNDER ADVISEMENT

  The Conference was told that of the 214 referees reporting for
the quarter ending March 31, 1968, 176 reported no matters held
under advisement for 60 days or longer. The remaining 38 referees
reported a total of 72 matters undecided, a sum which in the view of
the Bankruptcy Division is normal.

             DEVELOPMENTS UNDER CHAPTER          XIII
   The Conference was advised that the Bankruptcy Division has
continued its study of accounting systems and audits of the records
of Chapter XIII trustees. While it does not appear feasihle to pre­
scrihe a uniform accounting system for all trustees, it does appear
feasihle and desirahle to prescribe minimum accounting standards
which accounting systems should meet. The Bankruptcy Division
is preparing and puhlishing such standards.
   The Conference also noted that progress has heen made in ohtain­
ing meaningful audits of Chapter XIII trustees' records and ac­
counts at reasonable costs in conformance with the guidelines          ( ,
adopted by the Conference at its September 1963 session (Conf.
Rept., pp. 87, 88). The Conference noted that the Committee
had approved proposals of the Bankruptcy Division in implemen­
tation of this program with instructions to bring the proposals to
the attention of the referees who supervise Chapter XIII trustee
operations.
                    SEMINARB FOR REFEREES

   The fifth annual seminar for referees in bankruptcy was held
in Washington during the week of March 25-29, 1968. These five
seminars have given every referee an opportunity to participate in
one of the national seminars.
   Regional two-day seminars have continued since the last ses­
sion of the Judicial Conference. Regional seminars have been held
in Chicago and New York City and additional seminars are con­
templated during 1968 for St. Paul, Minnesota, Portland, Oregon,
and either Atlanta or Athens, Georgia.
                                  79
                    COSTS OF ADMINIS'fRATION

  The Conference noted continued improvement in overall costs
of administration in straight bankruptcy cases. In fiscal year 1964
the percentage cost of administration of these cases was 26.6 per­
cent in cases having an average realization of $4,840; in 1967 the
percentage cost was 22.8 percent in cases having an average real­
ization of $5,445.

           BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION OF ApPOINTEES

   Judge Weinfeld pointed out to the Conference that referees in
bankruptcy are quasi-judicial officers who take the same oath of
office as judges but that at the present time no investigation is made
on a regular basis except on special requests of the district court
concerned of appointees to referee in bankruptcy positions. He
stated also that many trustees in Chapter XIII proceedings handle
substantial sums of money and occupy positions of trust and that
the Committee is of the view that where the district courts con­
cerned are of the opinion that such trustees should be the subject
of a background investigation, a policy should be adopted to pro­
vide for such investigation.
   The Conference noted and approved these recommendations)
adopting a policy that all appointees to referee in bankruptcy posi­
tions be the subject of investigation by the F.RI. and that Chap­
ter XIII trustees shall be the subject of such investigations upon
recommendation of the district courts concerned.

                  REVISION OF THE LAWS
   Judge J. Skelly Wright, Chairman of the Committee on Revision
of the Laws, presented the Committee's report.
   The Conference approved the Committee's recommendation ap­
proving S. 2716, 90th Congress, a bill which would update references
in certain federal statutes to Oklahoma state courts dealing with
Indians.
   The Conference approved S. 2941, 90th Congress, which would
amend the provisions of Chapter 5, Title 5, United States Code,
making the Freedom of Information Act applicable to the District
of Columbia government. When the Freedom of Information Act
was passed in 1966, the operations of the District of Columbia gov­
                                         80 

ernment were excluded from its coverage. This bill would remedy
the omission.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee recommendation
that it express no view on S. 858, 90th Congress, which would
amend the Interstate Commerce Act with respect to recovery of
reasonable attorneys' fees in succeessful suits for recovery of dam­
ages sustained in the transportation of property by common car­
rier. The Conference was of the view that this legislation
presented a policy question which addresses itself to Congress and
presents no substantial problem in judicial administration.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee recommendation
that S. 3163, 90th Congress, a bill to provide courts of the United
States with jurisdiction over contract claims against non-appropria­
ted fund activities of the United States, concerns a matter of fiscal
policy which is properly a concern of the Congress rather than the
judiciary. The Conference, therefore, expressed no view on S. 3163.
The bill is similar to H.R. 3084, 90th Congress, on which the Con­
ference declined to express its views at the February 1968 meeting
(Con£. Rept., p. 15).
   As to S. 3305, S. 3306, H.R. 16706 and H.R. 16707, 90th Congress,
bills which would provide for federal jurisdiction over cases arising
out of certain operations of commercial aircraft, the Conference
approved, in principle, the proposed legislation insofar as .
    (1) 	 It would create a federal callS'e of action and a 'body (}f unif(}rI1l fed­
         eral law covering damage claims arising out of commercial aviatloo
         activity;
    (2) 	It adopts and expands the Multidistrict Litigation Act prooedures; and
    (3) 	It provides foc extraterritorial service of process and subpoenas through­
        out the country.
  The Conference noted that the Senate bills are now under active
consideration in the Senate Subcommittee on Improvements in
Judicial Machinery.
  The Conference disapproved insofar as the bill relates to judicial
review of attorneys' fees set by administrative agencies H.R. 15150,
90th Congress. The Conference noted that it has disapproved simi­
lar bills, S. 1073 and H.R. 10216, 90th Congress, at its February
1968 meeting (Conf. Rept., p.14).
   The Conference voted disapproval of H.R. 15118, 90th Congress,
a bill which would amend Title 28, United States Code, to require
three-judge district courts to determine cases involving reversal of
a decision of the highest court of a state.
                                 81 

   The Conference approved H.R. 5713, 90th Congress, to amend
Section 2401 of Title 28, United States Code, expanding the time
for filing tort actions by persons under the age of 21 or mentally
ill or imprisoned on a criminal charge. The Conference noted that
the bill is similar to H.R. 4334, 90th Congress, which was ap­
proved by the Conference at its March 1967 meeting (Conf. Rept.,
p. 20).
   The Conference voted its approval, in principle, of Sections 137
and 294 of H.R. 5924, a bill providing for a general revision of the
patent laws. Section 134 provides that the burden of persuasion is
on the applicant for a patent and Section 294 for collateral estoppel
when a claim in a patent is finally found to be invalid and author­
izing cancellation thereof by the court.
   At the same time the Conference voted its disapproval of two
other sections of the proposed legislation, namely, Section 147 re­
lating to the review of Patent Office decisions and Section 747 pro­
viding for appointment by district courts of civil commissioners for
patent cases.
   The Conference voted its disapproval of H.R. 17441, 90th Con­
gress, amending Title 28, United States Code, to incorporate therein
provisions relating to the creation of a United States Labor Board
and the abolition of the National Labor Relations Board. The bill
is similar to H.R. 12659 and H.R. 12993 disapproved by the Confer­
ence at its February 1968 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 15), as well as to
similar bills disapproved by the Conference at its September 1967
meeting (Conf. Rept., pp. 67, 68).
   The Conference voted its disapproval of H.R. 17742, 90th Con­
gress, providing for the enforcement of support orders in certain
state and federal courts and making it a crime to move or travel in
interstate and foreign commerce to avoid compliance with such
orders. The bill is similar to H.R. 5267, 90th Congress, disapproved
by the Conference at its March 1967 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 21),
and H.R. 11663, 90th Congress, disapproved by the Conference at
its September 1967 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 68).
   Judge Wright advised the Conference that the Committee on the
Revision of the Laws, meeting jointly with the Committee on Court
Administration, has deferred its study of district court jurisdiction
pending the completion of the American Law Institute study of the
division of jurisdiction between state and federal courts. The
American Law Institute study is now complete and recommends
                                       82 

far-reaching changes not only in diversity jurisdiction but in the
federal question jurisdiction as well.
   Before completing their study of the recommendations and be­
fore completing their own, the Committees requested and were
granted authorization by the Conference to obtain copies of the
ALI study for the bench and bar in order to obtain the reaction and
the response of the bench and bar to the ALI study. The Confer­
ence further approved the recommendation that the chief judge
of each circuit he requested to obtain the consensus of the judges of
his circuit concerning the ALI study and report thereon by July 1,
1969.
  The Conference approved S. 2721, 90th Congress, relating to the
amendment of the Expediting Act, 15 U.S.C. 29; 49 U.S.c. 45, with
the following exceptions:
    (1) 	'!'here should be included in the legislation a prOvision for repeal of
         Section 1 which requires the calling of a three-judge court on certifica­
        tion of the Attorney General and
    (2) 	the elimination of the provision for appeals from interlocutory orders
         under 28 u.s.c. l292(b).
   The Conference recommitted to the Committees on the Revision
of the Laws and on Court Administration for further study S. 2041
and H.R. 10100, 90th Congress, bills which would transfer the Tax                    (
Court of the United States to Title 28, United States Code, as a                         '
constitu tional court. In so doing, the Conference noted that Senator
Tydings had advised the Conference in his presentation to the Con­
ference that his Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Ma­
chinery was going to give further study to these legislative
proposals.
             TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE
  Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Committee on
Trial Practice and Technique, presented the Committee's report.
  Judge Murrah advised the Conference that two seminars for
newly appointed district judges had been held thus far in 1968.
These seminars have been expanded to a nine-day format, includ­
ing a full day session on sentencing in criminal cases. So far 55
judges have attended the 1968 seminars. A further seminar is
scheduled to be held commencing October 25 and will he the first
held in conjunction with the Federal Judicial Center.
  In view of prior Conference authorization that the Committee
                                                                                     (
                                        83 


initiate a broad program designed to encourage the development
of sound methods of dealing with congested calendars in the dis­
trict courts through the use of accelerated calendars and other
proven techniques of calenedar control and the further authoriza­
tion that the Committee cooperate with those districts having
congested calendars in formulating sound procedures of calendar
control consistent with the needs of the jurisdiction (Con£. Rept.,
Sept. 1967, p. 85), Judge Murrah stated that the Committee con­
siders to be essential to any accelerated calendar program the
following:
    (1) 	Careful and thorough analysis of the inventory of pending cases, per­
         haps through the use of computer techniques;
    (2) 	 Adequate nwnber of judges to be available for the trial of cases;
    (3) 	 Timely notice to the bar advising of the objectives of the program and
         the need for the bar to complete preparation for trial as promptly as
         possible;
    (4) Adequate pretrial conference review, and
    (5) 	 The setting of cases for trial with strong judicial control over requests
        fo'r continuance.
   Judge Murrah stated that his Committee is prepared to offer
its assistance to any district in a cooperative effort to deal effectively
with any problem of congestion.
                          MULTIPLE LITIGATION

   Judge Murrah presented to the Conference a complete revision
of the Outline of Suggested Precedures and Materials for Pretrial
and Trial of Complex and Multiple Litigation. The Conference
voted its approval of this revised report and authorized its dis­
semination. The Conference agreed that the pUblication should be
in looseleaf form so that it might be updated periodically and
it agreed that the Committee should continue to be in charge of
such necessary revisions and updating.
