REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
                   OFFICE
  Ernest C. Friesen, Jr., Director of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts, had previously submitted to the members of
the Conference his report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969,
in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 604(a) (3). The
Conference authorized the immediate release of the report and
                                  49 

authorized the Director to revise and supplement the final printed
edition to be issued later.

                        STATE OF THE DOCKETS

   Courts of Appeals.-New case filings in the courts of appeals
went above the 10,000 level for the first time in 1969, Mr. Friesen
stated. New cases docketed numbered 10,248, while cases disposed
of increased to 9,014, also the highest on record. Because of the
large increase in filings, however, the pending caseload on June 30,
1969 reached an all-time high of 7,849. Mr. Friesen advised the
Conference that the upward trend in new case filings which began
in 1961 has resulted in more than doubling the pending caseload
in the last seven years.
   The increase in cases docketed was registered in nine of the
eleven circuits, with the highest increase in the Fifth Circuit-27.9
percent; the Ninth Circuit was next with 26.4 percent; the Second
 Circuit reflected an increase of 17.8 percent and the District of
Columbia-15.8 percent.
   The increase in cases docketed in 1969 came almost entirely from
decisions of the United States district courts and was heavily re­
flected in habeas corpus appeals by federal prisoners which were up
55 percent and in appeals from the denial of motions to vacate
sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255 which were up 29 percent.
   District Courts.-The new case filings in 1969 reflected a sharp
departure from the leveling trend in both civil and criminal cases
in the district courts reflected in fiscal year 1968. Civil filings and
dispositions, respectively, increased by 8.0 percent and 6.5 percent
during 1969. Total civil actions filed in the district courts in 1969
were 77,193 and the dispositions were 73,354. Numerically, the
largest increase was in the filing of prisoner petitions which ac­
counted for one out of every six civil cases filed in the United States
district courts in 1969. The median time interval from issue to trial
for civil cases was 13 months, an increase of one month over 1968.
   Criminal cases filed in 1969 reached an all-time peak of 33,585
as compared with 30,714 cases filed in 1968. Terminations reached a
new high of 30,578 but the pending caseload rose to 17,770. Of
this pending caseload at the end of the year, 3,521 had been pending
more than six months but less than one year and 2,625 had been
pending more than one year but less than two years.
     372-659--70----2
                                 50 

   The type of criminal cases filed in 1969 changed considerably
from those filed in 1968. Selective Service Act cases, for example,
were up 81 percent, illegal immigration cases were up 57 percent
and prosecutions for violation of the narcotics laws were up 21 per­
cent. Declines were noted particularly in prosecutions for the viola­
tion of the liquor laws and in fraud cases.
   Bankruptcy.-For the second successive year new bankruptcy
cases declined. In 1969 a total of 184,930 bankruptcy cases was
filed. This is a decline in filings of 6.5 percent. The heaviest nu­
merical declines in 1969, as in 1968, were in the Sixth and Ninth
Circuits. Of the total filings, 91.7 percent were non-business bank­
ruptcies. The number of business bankruptcies remained at a
fairly stable level of 8.3 percent of the total.
      COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
  Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on Court Administration.
                  RESOLUTIONS OF JUNE    10, 1969
  At a special meeting of the Judicial Conference of the United
States on June 10, 1969 four resolutions were passed, three of
which required further implementation and report to the next
session of the Conference by the Committee on Court
Administration.
  Judge Ainsworth stated that his committee which met in mid­
August had discussed at considerable length the first resolution of
June 10, 1969 (Conf. Rept., p. 42) relating to the performance of
services other than judicial duties by federal judges. He stated that
his committee recommended to the Conference that no change
should be made in Resolution I short of one year's experience under
the resolution as drafted. At the end of a year the committee pro­
posed that it would then report to the Conference with regard to
the operation of the resolution and any modification whjch might
be indicated.
   The Chief Justice advised the Conference that in this connection
he had received a letter, dated October 27,1969, from Chief Justice
Roger J. Traynor of California, Chairman of a special committee
of the American Bar Association created in August 1969 to study
the entire problem of revising the canons of judicial ethics. Chief
                                       51 

Justice Traynor's letter stated that his committee had held its
first meeting on October 25 and that it hopes to have a tentative
draft of the proposed standards of judicial conduct available for
consideration by the bench and bar by mid-year of 1970. Chief
Justice Traynor's letter continued:
     There wUl be obvious advantages if the rules finally developed for federal
   judges can take into account the work of our committee. lit will be fortunate
   if both the federal and state judiciaries can eventually abide by the same
   set of basic canons, and if the federal judiciary can avoid the poflsible clash
   of Circuit Oouncils in interpreting what is considered appropriate non­
   judicial services. To achieve these ends the members of the committee
   respectfully suggest that the Oonterence may wish to consider suspending
   for as long a period as it deems appropriate any further action on all the
   resolutions adopted in June. We make this suggestion so that the Oonference
   in whatever action tit ultimately takes, may have the benefit of the research
   and work of this coonmittee.
  After considerable discussion of the request of Chief Justice
Traynor and his committee, the Conference adopted the following
resolution:
     Whereas, judges have, since June 10, 1969, 'been reporting their non­
   judicial activities to the judicial councils of the respective cireuits in ac­
   cordance with a resolution adopted by the Judicial Conference of the United
   States, and it now a,ppears that since the Judicial Conference provided no
   guidelines or standards, the various judicial councils of the circuits acting
   without standards or guidelines have not acted uniformly, and
     Whereas, the American Bar Association is now conducting a study on the
   subject of judicial conduct, including the non-judicial activities of judges,
   and the ABA advUles that this study will be substantially completed by
   the Summer of 1910 and that this study will permit a more thorough under­
   standing of ,the subject matter, it is hereby resolved :
     That for the calendar yea-r 1969 and the calendar year 1910, Resolution I
   of June 10, 1969, with respect to compensation for non-judicial services by
   judges be suspended, and instead,
        (a) 	Th8.t the Chief Justice be authorized to appoint a receiving oflicer
             to receive reports;
        (b) 	That any judge who in any quarterly period receives compensation
            for non-judicial services, in a total amount exceeding $100, shall
             report the same forthwith to the receiving oflicer, on forms to be
             furnished, with the details thereof;
        (c) 	That these reports be forwarded by the receiving oflicer to the
            members of a panel of three, United States judges designated by
             the Chief Justice,but be at all times kept confidential by them
            except to tbe extent that the panel concludes that they should be
            brought tu the attention of the Judicial Conference in executive
            session for consideration of any aspect as to which the panel feels
            there may be a question of conflict with standards of Judicial con­
            duct, or except to any othe-.t" extent that the Conference shall order;
                                     52 

       (d) 	Finally, that the Conference cooperate and collaborate with the
           American Bar Association Committee on the Code of Judicial Con­
           duct and that the Chief Justice be authorized, in his discretion, to
           designate one or more representatives of the Conference to present
           the views of the federal judiciary to that Committee, if requested.
   Judge Ainsworth then reported on Resolution II of June 10 and
advised the Conference that his committee had agreed upon a fi­
nancial statement and a procedure for the implementation of the
filing of such a financial statement and he recommended that the
Conference authorize the immediate transmission of this proposed
financial statement and procedure for its implementation to all
federal judges with a request that they submit their comments
thereon prior to January 1, 1970. Judge Ainsworth stated to the
Conference that this would permit the committee to report back
to the Conference at its March 1970 session on any changes deemed
appropriate in view of the comments received, thus permitting the
Conference to adhere to the timetable established in June for the
filing of the first reporting statement on May 15, 1970 for calendar
year 1969.
   The Conference approved the transmission to all federal judges
for comment of the proposed financial statement and procedure for
its implementation and also voted that, in soliciting the views of
the judges, they also be requested to give their views on the desir­
ability of any financial reporting by federal judges.
    Resolution III of June 10 called for a progress report by the
Committee on Court Administration on the formulation of stand­
ards of judicial conduct. Judge Ainsworth stated that when his
committee had last met, the American Bar Association had voted
the creation of a committee to revise the standards of judicial
conduct which has since been appointed and is now functioning.
He stated that his committee recommended to the Conference that
it be authorized to work in close cooperation with the American
Bar Association committee to avoid duplication of effort and that
the committee be permitted to defer any report on Resolution III
until the ABA committee has reported and its recommendations
have been subjected to scrutiny and study. The Conference agreed
to this procedure.
    Judge Ainsworth then, in implementation of Resolution IV of
June 10, presented to the Conference a draft bill to amend Section
331 of Title 28, United States Code, to authorize the Judicial
Conference of the United States to promulgate rules and standards
                                 53 

governing the conduct of United States judges. The Conference
approved the transmittal of this draft to the Congress.

               JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT
   Judge Ainsworth presented to the Conference a revised draft of
S. 1511, the bill drafted by the Senate Subcommittee on Improve­
ments in Judicial Machinery, to provide benefits for survivors of
federal judges comparable to benefits received by survivors of
members of Congress. Judge Ainsworth stated that representatives
of the committee had worked in close collaboration with the Senate
Subcommittee and the Civil Service Commission and that certain
technical changes might still be required in the draft but he stated
that his committee recommended approval of S. 1511, in principle.
The Conference agreed and authorized committee representatives
to continue to work with representatives of the Senate Subcom­
mittee and other interested agencies to eliminate any technical
difficulties which might remain in the draft of the statute.

                 JUDICIAL REFORM ACT OF 1969
   Judge Ainsworth next reported on S. 1506, 91st Congress, a bill
styled the {(Judicial Reform Act of 1969." He stated that Title I
of the bill provides for a national commission of judges to pass
upon the good behavior of a judge. It gives investigative powers
 to the oommission and provides for an appeal by way of certiorari
to the Supreme Court of the United States if the Judicial Confer­
ence returns a finding of misconduct. If upon final disposition of
the case by the Court, the determination is adverse to the judge,
the bill provides that he shall be removed from office as if he had
been found guilty by the Senate in an impeachment proceeding
and a successor judge may be appointed by the President.
   Judge Ainsworth reminded the Conference that this subject
matter ha.s been considered by the Conference in the recent past
and that draft bills have been circulated by the Conference to the
entire federal judiciary on this subject matter. He stated that
while there was considerable disagreement within his commit­
tee as to whether this subject matter can best be handled by a na­
tional commission or by the grant of additional authority to the
judicial councils of the circuits, the committee had resolved to
recommend Conference approval of Title I of S. 1506. After
                                 54 

discussion of this item, the Conference requested that the com­
mittee again consider Title I and attempt to reconcile differences
of view and asked the committee to report back to the March
1970 session of the Conference.
   In considering the provisions of Section 201 of Title II of S. 1506
providing for the retirement of a Justice or a judge after twenty
years of continuous service, the Conference agreed with the com­
mittee recommendation that this statute should be amended to
provide that a judge may retire after twenty years of continuous
service if he has reached the age of sixty. The same comments were
made to S. 1508, a separate bill carrying out the provisions of Sec­
tion 201 of Title II.
   Judge Ainsworth stated that his committee had given careful
consideration to Sections 390(a) and 390(b) of Title IV of S. 1506
relating to conflicts of interest and had reached the conclusion
that the language now in Title 28, United States Code, 455, is pref­
erable. The Conference agreed.
   In considering Section 391 of Title IV and several other bills
relating to the filing of financial statements by judges, the com­
mittee recommended and the Conference agreed that the form
of financial statement prepared by the committee and authorized
for circulation for comment by federal judges was preferable.
   The Conference requested the committee to consider further the
proposals of Title V of S. 1506 which are also included in S. 1514
providing for the service of district judges upon the judicial coun­
cils of the circuits.
   In considering Title V of S. 1506 relating to court executives for
circuit and district courts, the Conference expressed its preference
for the provisions relating to court executives as contained in S.
952 as it passed the Senate on June 23, 1969. The Conference
opposed, however, the method of selection of court executives pro­
vided in S. 952, namely, from a panel of three names proposed
by the Director of the Administrative Office.
   The Conference requested the committee to study further the
provisions of S. 1507 which would require mandatory retirement
of Justices and judges upon reaching the age of seventy.
   It also requested further committee study of S. 1513 which would
amend Section 294 of Title 28, United States Code, to permit the
assignment of duties to a judge retired involuntarily under Section
372(b) but who is willing and able to undertake additional judicial
duties.
                                   55 


   The Conference expressed approval of S. 1512 which would
amend Section 372(a) of Title 28, United States Code, to provide
that each Justice or judge retired under that section shall receive
the salary of his office during the remainder of his lifetime.
   The Conference also approved an amendment to Section 373
of Title 28, United States Code, to provide that a judge in the terri­
tories and possessions may retire after twenty years of service, con­
tinuous or otherwise, at the salary the judge was receiving when
he relinquished his office.
   The Conference disapproved S. 1515 providing that a judge can­
not begin to serve as chief judge after reaching the age of sixty-six.
                  MATTERS RELATING TO JUDGES

   The Conference considered H.R. 4080, a bill to provide a pension
 for the widow of Judge R. H. Weber who died some four months
 short of five years of service as required under the Judicial Survivors
Annuity Act and voted its disapproval of this bill..
   The Conference disapproved a proposal which would provide
for the voluntary retirement at full pay of federal judges at age
sixty after eigh t or more years on the bench.
   The Conference also disapproved a proposal submitted by a fed­
eral judge which would provide that a judge who becomes a wid­
ower may stop making contributions or may withdraw his
contributions to the Survivors Annuity Fund.
   The Conference voted its disapproval of H.R. 10281 which would
provide for recalculating the insurance to be paid to the widow of
Referee Fishberg of New Jersey who died three weeks before his
salary and insurance would have been increased by operation of
statute.
   The Conference voted disapproval of H.R. 1874 which would
permit Judge Pence of Hawaii to include in computing his aggre­
gate years of judicial service under 28 U.S.C. 371, 372 and 376 the
period of time in which he served as a territorial judge. The Con­
ference had disapproved similar legislation in March 1967 (Conf.
Rept., p. 13).
   The Conference also disapproved H.R. 11360, a bill which would
permit federal judges to exclude from gross income for tax pur­
poses pensions and retirement pay received while "performing full
judicial service."
                                56
                     DIVISIONS OR DISTRICTS

   Judge Ainsworth advised that the Committee on Court Admin­
istration had considered several bills which had been referred by
the Congress affecting existing judicial districts or divisions.
   In response to considering the committee's report, the Confer­
ence voted its disapproval of S. 2364 which would establish one
additional judicial district and one additional permanent judgeship
in Ohio and H.R. 11352 which would create an additional judicial
district in Ohio and authorize two district judgeships for the dis­
trict. The Conference noted that these bills had been disapproved
by the Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit.
   The Conference approved S. 1646 which would create a new
Middle District of Louisiana with court to be held at Baton Rouge
and in so doing noted that this legislation had been approved by
the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit.
   The Conference approved H.R. 2072 which would transfer Hay­
wood County from the Western Division to the Eastern Division
of the Western District of Tennessee. Similar legislation had been
approved by the Conference in September 1968 (Conf. Rept., p.
53) and in March 1969 (Conf. Rept., p. 8).
   The Conference also approved H.R. 2501 which would include
Panola and Shelby Counties within the Marshall Division of the
Eastern District of Texas. Similar legislation had been endorsed at
the February 1968 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 10).
                   PLACES OF HOLDING     CoURT
   The Conference considered several bills affecting places of hold­
ing court and in each instance acted in accordance with the recom­
mendations of the judicial councils of the respective circuits
involved.
   The Conference approved H.R. 777 which would require the
holding of court at Coquille, Oregon. The Conference had approved
a similar bill in September 1968 (Conf. Rept., p. 52).
   The Conference endorsed H.R. 7039 for the holding of court at
Reading in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and noted that
a similar provision was included in S. 952 as it passed the Senate
on June 23,1969. The Conference had approved a similar proposal
in September 1968 (Conf. Rept., p. 53).
   The Conference then disapproved the following:
                                 57 

  H.R. 2066 for the holding of court at Fort Lauderdale in the
Southern District of Florida;
  H.R. 9639 for the holding of court at Richmond in the Southern
District of Indiana;
  H.R. 6167 for the holding of court at Rockford in the Northern
District of Illinois;
  S. 981 and H.R. 8786 for the holding of court in Hyattsville in
the District of Maryland and H.R. 9833 which would amend 28
U.S.c. 124( d) by eliminating the phrase "at no expense to the
government" in connection with the holding of court at Odessa,
Texas.
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  Judge Ainsworth stated that Conference views have been asked
on S. 2040 which would make permanent the temporary judgeship
in the Eastern District of Wisconsin and H.R. lO902, a bill to ac­
complish the same purpose. The Conference took no action on these
bills inasmuch as similar provisions were in S.. 952, the bill which
passed the Sena~e on June 23, 1969.
   The Conference considered H.R. 6761 to provide two additional
judgeships for the Western District of Texas. The Conference.had
previously recommended one additional judgeship for this district
and this recommendation was contained in S. 952 as it passed the
Senate, (see Conf. Rept., March 1969, p. 8). The Conference agreed
that the emergency standard under which the Conference has
operated in approving additional judgeships other than at the time
of the quadrennial survey indicated that two additional judgeships
for the Western District of Texas could not be supported and,
acGQrdingly,voted its disapproval of H.R. 6761.
              NATIONAL CRIME STATISTICS CENTER

  The Conference voted its. approval of H.R. 5225, a bill which
would establish a national crime statistics center independent of
any existing department or agency.
                       STATISTICAL REPORTS

  The Conference noted the concern expressed by the Committee
on Court Administration that in some instances the judicial councils
of the circuits might not be giving full consideration to the quar­
terly statistical reports of the Director of the Administrative Office
     372-659--70~
                                      58 

and, therefore, approved the following resolution recommended
by the committee:
   The Administrative Office of the United States Courts is instructed to call to
    the attention of each circuit judge in active service the statutory obligation
   imposed upon the judicial council of each circuit by Section 332 of Title 28
   to meet at least semi-annually to consider the quarterly reports of the Direc­
   tor of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and to take such
   aotion thereon as may be necessary for the effective and expeditious admin­
   istration of the business of the courts, within the circnit.
   Judge Ainsworth advised the Conference that representatives of
the Subcommittee on Judicial Statistics are working closely with
the Federal Judicial Center in a study designed to test the validity
of the weighted caseload index. He stated that the Center has en­
tered into a contract with the Graduate School of the Department
of Agriculture for this study. He also said that the subcommittee
is giving close consideration to a revision of the J.S. 10 Form with
a view possibly even to eliminating this form in favor of some
other reporting method.
   Judge Ainsworth also stated that the subcommittee is prepar­
ing for its quadrenniel survey of the courts of appeals in 1970 and
haa requested the Administrative Office to update its statistical
tables compiled for the 1966 report on the courts of appeals pre­
pared by former Deputy Director Will Shafroth.

                        SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

   Court Reporters.-The Conference noted that.S. 952 as it passed
the Senate contained two provisions previously recommended by
the Judicial Conference. One provision would eliminate the maxi­
mum and minimum limitations upon the salaries of court report­
ers (see Conf. action, Feb. 1968 Report, p. 31, and September
1968 Report, p. 58). The second provision would allow for contract­
ing with court reporter services for temporary purposes in emer­
gency situations (see Conf. action, March 1969 Report, p. 9).
   The third section of S. 952 relating to court reporters provides
for electronic court reporting in situations when reporters are not
necessarily present. The Conference voted its endorsement of this
proposal.
   Chief Judge Cowen moved that the Conference endorse legis­
lation tha.t the Court of Claims be permitted to contract for re­
porting services in the same manner as is now permitted for the
Tax Court. The Conference voted its approval and authorized
                                   59 

the Administrative Office to draft such legislation for transmittal
to the Congress.
  Clerks of Court.-On Committee recorrunendation the Confer­
ence voted an increased salary schedule for the clerks of court for
the circuits and districts as follows:
   Oourts of Appeals___________________________________________   28,000
   Large Districts____________________________________________    28,000
   Medium Districts__________________________________________     25,000
   Small Districts-______________________________,____________    22,000
   Territorial OOurts__________________________________________   18,000

   The Conference also approved a revision of the Judicial Salary
Plan for a one-grade increase in the position of Chief Deputy Clerk
in the district courts and a two-grade increase in the circuit courts
subject to the availability of funds, as follows:
Courts of Appeals: 

   Large. office: 

        From JSP 13 to ___________________________________________ JSP 15
    Medium office :
       From JSP 12 to____________________________________________ JSP 14
    Small office:
       From JSP 11 to____________________________________________ JSP 13
District Courts:
    lAnge districts:
         From JSP 14 to____________________________________________ JSP 15
   Medium districts:
      From JSP 13 to____________________________________________ JSP 14
   Small districts:
      From JSP 12 to____________________________________________ JSP 13

   The Conference also approved a maximum entrance classification
of JBP 11 for the pro se clerks who are attached to the clerk's office
for administrative purposes. This conforms to the cWsification now
in effect for judges' law clerks generally.
   Court Criers.-The Conference noted a recommendation of Chief
Judge Hastie that a new position of court crier-secretary be created
and referred this matter for study to the Committee on Court
Administration.
   Interpreters.-The Conference voted to approve the establiSh­
ment of the position of Spanish Interpre.ter in the United States
District Court for the Eastern Distri6tof N ewYork.
                           ADMINISTRATION

  In response to a resolution propOsed by Chief Judge Brown at
the March 1969 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 9) look­
ing toward the employment of every modern means of management
available and the utilization of scientific long*range planning and
programming, the Conference adopted the following resolutions:
    (1) 	 That the Conference continue its program of taking all possible meas­
         ures to improve methods and procedures in the courts; and the Confer­
          ence and its agencies, the Committee on Court Administration. the
          Subcommittee on Supporting Personnel. and the Administrative Office
          have the responsibility of exploring supporting personnel problems and
          promising innovations. as to positions. methods, etc., to enable the
          judiciary to anticipate and meet its continuously increasing burdens;
    (2) 	 That the Conference exert every effort to obtain for the courts the sup­
         porting personnel necessary to insure that they are adequately staffed to
         perform properly their judicial and administrative functions; and in its
         relations with the Congress, the Conference, through its proposed budget
         requests and otherwise, communicate fully the problems of the judiciary,
         request the appropriations required to meet these needs. and to the maxi­
         mum practicable extent urge Congressional acceptance of such proposals
         and recommendations;
    (3) 	That the Conference support the efforts of the Administrative Office to
          secure an appropriation that will provide the special and technical
          personnel necessary to afford expert mallRl;"ement assistance on operating
          problems;
    (4) 	 That the Conference reaffirm its prior request that the Chief Judge of
         each Circuit Court of Appeals furnish the Administrative Office a pro­
          jection of the personnel needs of his court, and that such projections be
         furnished annually by May 1 of each year;
    (5) 	 That the Conference request that the Chief Judge of each District Court
         furnish the Administrative Office with Ii projectIon of the personnel
          needs of his court by May 1 of each year.

                           LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

   The Conference considered S. 961 and H.R. 8373, 91st Congress,
bills which provide for federal jurisdiction and a body of uniform
federal laws for cases arising out of aviation and space activities.
The Conference at its September 1968 session had approved, in
principle, similar bills introduced in the 90th Congress (Conf.
Rept., p. 80). The Conference reaffirmed its support of these legis*
lative proposals.
   Upon the request of the Chairman of the Civil Service Commis­
sion, the Conference 'considered S. 682, 91st Congress, a bill de*
signed to protect civilian employees of the executive branch of the
government in the enjoyment of their constitutional rights and to
prevent unwarranted governmental invasion of privacy and spe­
cifically Section 4 of the bill which would give the employee the
right to go directly into the federal courts~ Inasmuch as Section 5 of
                                 61 

the bill provides for the utilization of the administrative process by
the aggrieved employee, the Conference disapproved Section 4 as
being inconsistent with the provisions of Section 5.
   The Conference next considered a draft bill prepared by the
Department of Justice to amend the Expediting Act (15 U.S.C.
27, 28; 49 U.S.C. 44, 45). The Conference noted that similar leg­
islation had been presented for its consideration in September 1968
 (Conf. Rept., p. 82) at which time the Conference had approved
the legislation, in principle, with two exceptions. Inasmuch as the
present legislation was designed to meet these objections, the Con­
ference approved the Justice Department's draft, in principle.
   The Conference also noted and approved a draft bill of the
Department of Justice which would permit actions for condemna­
tion of real property in more than one state for a single federal
project to be tried in the same district court.
   The Conference also approved S. 2624 and H.R. 12691, 91st
Congress, bills which would amend the statutory provisions relat·
ing to judicial actions and administrative proceedings in the Cus·
toms Court and in appeals from decisions of the Customs Court.
   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
        .      CRIMINAL LAW
  The Report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law was presented by the Chairman, Judge George C.
Edwards, Jr.
  COMMITMENT OF PERsONS ACQUITTED ON THE GROUND OF
                             INSANITY

   Judge Edwards advised the Conference that for the past six
years legislation has come before the committee and the Confer­
ence and that at the March 1969 session he advised the Conference
(Conf. Rept., p. 9) that he had appointed a subcommittee to study
legislative proposals providing for the commitment of persons
acquitted on the grounds of insanity. Representatives of the sub­
committee met with representatives of the Department of Justice,
Bureau of Prisons, National Institute of Mental Health- and the
Public Health Service. This interdepartmental group noted that
S. ,979 and H.R. 447 taken together would constitute a complete
revision of Chapter 313 of Title 18, United States Code. Working
                                       62 

from these two bills the interdepartmental committee had drafted
an entire revision of Chapter 313 and Judge Edwards stated that
his committee approved this draft and recommended it to the Con­
ference for approval. The Conference was in agreement with the
recommendation of the committee and directed the Administrative
Office to transmit copies of the draft bill to the Congress.

                    EXPEDITING CRIMINAL JUSTICE

   Pursuant to the authorization of the Conference at the March
1969 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 10), Judge Edwards reported that
a subcommittee had considered a number of factors bearing on
the delay of criminal cases and studied the statistical data provided
by the Administrative Office. As a result of the deliberations of
this subcommittee, Judge Edwards stated that his committee recom­
mends to the Conference adoption of a resolution declaring long
pending cases as "judicial emergencies." After discussion of this
matter, the Conference voted the following resolution:
      Resolved: 1. That it is the sense of the Conference that criurlnal cases in
   the federal courts, except cases involving fugitives, persons in the military
   services, and persons in mental or penal institutions who are unavailable
   for trial, which are pending for more than one year as of the close of any
   fiscal year, are a judicial emergency to be regarded as such by all judges
   within any circuIt where such cases are found;
                 2. That <the Director of the Administrative Office is hereby auth­
    rized and directed to prepare at the end of each fiscal year and send to the
    Chief Judge of each Circuit a list of all sueh cases pending within the circuit
   for more than one year, with copies to the Chief Judge and United States
   Attorney of each affeeted distrIct within the circuit. The Director is
   authorized and directed to send a copy of all such Usts prepared by him also
   to (1) the Attorney general of the United States for his information and
   such comments which he cares to make, and (2) the Committee on the
   Administration of the Oriminal Law;
                 3. That the Judicial Councils of each Oircuit are requested to
   make appropriate plans for the disposition of these cases pending for more
    than one year on the dockets.

                ABoLITION OF THE DEATH PENALTY

  Judge Edwards advised. the Conference that two bills, H.R. 666
and H.R. 2176, to abolish the death penalty under all laws of the
United States, had been referred to the Conference for comment.
He stated that his committee was· of the view that thi's subject
matter was primarily one of policy to be determined by the Con­
gress but that the committee recommended, however, that the Con­
                                 63 

ference express the view that the death penalty with certain
possible exceptions should be abolished. A motion to table this
recommendation carried.
                     OBSCENITY LEGISLATION

  Judge Edwards stated that the views of the Conference were
sought on two bills relating to obscenity, H.R. 5171 and H.R. 7201,
but that the committee was of the view that the Conference should
defer any action on such legislation pending the report of the
President's Commission on Obscenity. The Conference agreed with
this recommendation.
               ApPELLATE REVIEW OF SENTENCING

   Judge Edwards stated that the Conference's views had been
sought on H.R. 6188, a bill which would allow either the govern­
ment or the defendant to file with the district court an application
for leave to appeal the sentence of the court of appeals. The bill
grants discretionary authority to the court of appeals to review
the merits of the sentence to affirm, increase, modify or vacate the
sentence. The Conference noted that it had previously considered
legislation on the subject of appellate review of sentences and had
conditioned its approval (Conf. Rept., March 1967, p. 40). The
Conference expressed the view that some form of review of sen­
tences was desirable and requested the Committee on the Admin­
istration of the Criminal Law to study the problem further to
determine which form of review would most nearly meet the
endorsement of the Conference and which forum would most
appropriately be utilized for such purposes.
                        BAIL REFORM ACT

   Judge Edwards stated that his committee had studied a number
of bills introduced into the 91st Congress, First Session, to amend
the Bail Reform Act of 1966, including S. 288, S. 289, S. 546, H.R.
335, H.R. 578, H.R. 2781, H.R. 1033, H,R. 5864 and H.R. 8782.
Judge Edwards stated that the main thrust of most of the pending
bills is to provide for some form of preventive detention pending
trial. Mter discussion of this subject matter, a motion to table
Conference action at this time carried.
                                64

                    IMMUNITY OF WITNESSES
   The views of the Conference have been sought on H.R. 11157,
a bill which would make uniform a large number of immunity
statutes and which provides both for approval of the Attorney
General and a court or agency order before immunity is granted.
Judge Edwards st.ated that this is the first bill originating out of
the deliberations of the National Commission on Reform of Crim­
inal Law. He stated that an identical bill is pending in the Senate,
S. 2122. The Committee recommended Conference approval of this
legislative proposal and the Conference agreed.

                 ORGANIZED CruME LEGISLATION
  Judge Edwards advised that legislation was pending before the
Congress on the subject of organized crime, the underlying pur­
poses of which are so crucial and the remedies proposed so far­
reaching in the administration of the criminal law as to make them
the subject of special study by the committee. He advised the
Conference that he had appointed a special subcommittee to exam­
ine these legislative proposals in depth.
   COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY 

                  SYSTEM 

  Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System.
                     GP.AND JURY HANDBOOK
  Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that a subcommittee,
chaired by Judge Howard C. Bratton, had completed its efforts
in preparing a handbookfot federal grand jurors authorized by
the Conference at its September 1968 session. Judge Kaufman
reminded the Conference that for many years a handbook for
federal petit jurors, originally approved by the Judicial Confer­
ence, had been in use an~ found effective and helpfuL He stated
that the handbook for grand jurors seeks only to familiarize pro­
spective grand jurors with the nature 9f the grand jury and of
their duties as its members. It Clearly. contemplates an oral charge
by the court arid is infunded onlY.to supplement such a charge.
Upon recommendation of the committee, the Conference approved
                                        65 

the draft of the handbook for federal grand jurors with one minor
textual change and authorized its immediate printing and distribu­
tion to those courts desiring to use it.
                    EFFECTIVE USE OF JUROR TIME

   Judge Kaufman reminded the Conference that at the March
meeting he had reported on a study undertaken under the auspices
of the American Bar Foundation on the effective utilization of
jurors and that the Conference had expressed a desire to extend
this research project to a major metropolitan court center where
the need for efficient utilization of juror time is most critical. He
stated that he is attempting to enlist the services of the Federal
Judicial Center and the Institute of Judicial Administration to
assist the American Bar Foundation in conducting such studies in
the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York. He advised that
he would report further to the Conference on this subject at the
next session. The Conference moved to request the Federal Judicial
Center to study this problem, giving it a top priority in its research
program and asking for the necessary appropriations to accomplish
the task.
   In connection with the subject of effective utilization of jurors,
Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that a subcommittee had
conducted a selective survey addressed to the chief judges of 19
districts with the heaviest trial calendars and a survey of all district
court clerks. The result of this survey was to show that no district
involved had encountered any insurmountable problems in select­
ing jurors in accordance with the new Act but that implementing
the Act did impose an excessive workload on district court clerks'
offices. It was apparent that this criticism was directed principally
to the work involved in accomplishing the initial filling of the mas­
ter jury wheel and that, therefore, the problem was largely tran­
sitional. Pursuant to committee recommendation, the Conference
approved a four-point program:
    (a) 	That commencing in 1971, reports made to the Judicial Oonference
         pursuant to 28 U.S.O. 1OO3(a) be submitted to the Administrative Office
         within six months after each refilling of the master jury wheel in the
         respective district or division, but in no event, less often than every four
         years;
    (b) 	Tbat the time inte,rval for periOdic refilling of the master jury wheels
         be limited to a maximum of every four years;
    (c) 	That courts objecting to keeping a separate roster of perrous excused
         for individual hardship pursuant to 28 U.S.O. 1866(c) (1), be advised to
         eliminate such record keeping by amending their plans to provide that
     372-659--70----4
                                      66 

         the names of such persons be returned to the qualified jury box unless
         the court granting the e.xcuse should otherwise rule at the time of the
        excuse:
    (d) 	That the official juror qualification form be amended in several
        particulars.

      PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER THE JURY SELECTION ACT

   At the March 1969 session the Conference had charged the Com­
mittee on the Operation of the Jury System with undertaking a
study of the general system for the submission of periodic reports
by the district courts on the operation of their respective selective
jury systems as contemplated by 28 U.S.C. 1863(a). Judge Kauf­
man presented to the Conference regulations and forms adopted by
the committee for this purpose. The periodic reports contained
three different types of data: general information as to jury selec­
tion, an analysis by race and sex of a fair sample of persons con­
sidered for jury service and an analysis by race, sex and occupation
of a fair sample of persons who have actually reported for jury
service. The Conference approved the proposed regulations and
forms for periodic reports and directed that they be circulated to
the district courts prior to the date on which the first report is re­
quired to be submitted.
                               LEGISLATION

   Judge Kaufman stated that H.R. 10966 had been introduced and
would make mandatory an answer to the race question on the
juror qualification form, thus eliminating the option which is now
given to a prospective juror to answer or refuse to answer the
question as to race. He advised the Conference that empirical
studies undertaken thus far have indicated that unless the question
on race is answered, it will be difficult to prove that prospective
jurors are being drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.
He stated that his committee also deemed it important that the
questIOn as to occupation should be answered so as to assist in de­
termining whether the selection process is reaching a fair balance of
persons of diverse economic background. Upon recommendation of
the committee, the Conference approved the principle embodied in
H.R. 10966 but expressed the view that it would be preferable
also to make mandatory a reply to the question on occupation.
   The Conference further agreed that, pending possible legisla­
tive amendment to the Jury Selection and Service Act as proposed,
                                   67 

 those courts undertaking a review of the racial balance of their
 master jury wheels which find that more than five percent of the
 juror questionnaires in any drawing are returned either with the
 employment or racial information omitted should make further
 solicitation of those questionnaire recipients concerned to obtain
 their voluntary cooperation in providing the missing informaton.
    The Conference considered and on committee recommendation
 disapproved S. 2373, a bill which would provide jury trials in
 condemnation proceedings in the district courts of the United
 States. The bill would accord the right to a jury trial in land con­
 demnation proceedings to a defendant aggrieved by a determina­
 tion of just compensation by a commissioner appointed by a district
 court under Rule 71A(h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
 Similar legislation was disapproved by the Conference in Septem­
 ber 1965 (Conf. Rept., p. 63) and in March 1967 (Conf. Rept.,
 p. 	 21).
   Judge Kaufman next reported on the provisions of Title I of
 S. 30, a bill relating to the control of organized crime in the United
 States. Judge Kaufman stated that Ti'tle I proposes sweeping
changes in the procedures and functions of the federal grand jury.
It provides, among other things, that a grand jury on its own motion
 can extend its term as long as 36 months. It may report to the At­
torney General that an attorney, investigative officer or agent ap­
pearing before it on behalf of the United States has not performed
his duties "diligently and effectively," and it would, in fact, restore
the former system of returning presentments. These provisions
would be applicable to all grand juries and not restricted to those
engaged in investigations of "organized crime." Judge Kaufman
stated that the committee had concluded that the bill would se­
riously diminish the power of judges to supervise the activities of
grand juries, that it would invite grand juries to intervene in mat­
ters best left within the control of the executive and legislative
branches and, in general, that it would disrupt the orderly adminis­
tration of justice. He stated that while the Congress had not specifi­
cally requested the views of the Conference, the bill would alter
an important facet of the judicial process so drastically that an
expression of Conference opinion would hardly be inappropriate.
The Conference expressed its agreement with this point of view
and voted its disapproval of the provisions of Title I of S. 30.
                                 68
                         VOIR DIRE SURVEY

   Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that the committee in
April 1969 addressed a questionnaire to all federal district judges
designed to elicit data relating to voir dire procedures in the sev­
eral courts and seeking suggestions for reducing the time consumed
between the first appearance of a prospective juror at the court­
house and his selection as a juror. The responses to this question­
naire are under study and will be the subject of report to the
Conference when the committee is ready to make specific recom­
mendations. Among other things, the committee is considering the
supplemental questionnaire in use in some districts to facilitate
the juror selection process.
   Judge Kaufman stated that at the August meeting of his com­
mittee, Assistant Attorney General Leonard of the Civil Rights
Division of the Department of Justice delivered a comprehensive
report on the results of a survey of the views of United States At­
torneys on the operation of the new Jury Selection and Service Act
of 1968. Among other things, Mr. Leonard pointed out that the
great majority of United States Attorneys believed the Act is
functioning welL He stated that none of the reports reflected any
legal challenge to the respective selection systems since the Act
became effective.
                AUTOMATION OF JURY SELECTION

   Judge Kaufman advised the Conference that three metropolitan
courts are now automated and substantially all juror clerical tasks
are now performed by computer in the District of Columbia and the
Eastern and Sou them Districts of New York. It is hoped that dur­
ing fiscal year 1970 an additional four to eight courts will be auto­
mated. This computer service, when fully utilized, will not only
address the juror summons but will simultaneously imprint the
juror's name, address and number on his pay voucher through use
of a newly devised procedure that joins this voucher to the juror's
summons.
                 CHARGE TO A DEADLOCKED JURY

  Judge Kaufman stated that his committee had considered an
extensive report submitted by Judge Steckler on the "current status
of the law as respects the Allen charge." Judge Kaufman stated
                                 69 

that his committee favored the recommendation on this subject
matter of the American Bar Association's "Project on Minimum
Standards for Criminal Justice, Trial by Jury." He noted, however,
that the subject matter was currently the subject of litigation in the
courts and, accordingly, the Conference adopted a motion to table
further consideration of the subject of a charge to a deadlocked
jury.

         RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
   The report of the standing Committee of the Conference on
Rules of Practice and Procedure was presented by the Committee
Chairman, Judge Albert B. Maris.
   Judge Maris summarized the work of the advisory committees
and stated that. the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is
currently in the process of approving preliminary drafts of amend­
ments to a number of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
which will shortly be circulated to the bench and bar for comment.
   He noted, with sorrow, the death on March 27, 1969 of Senior
Circuit Judge Walter L. Pope who had rendered distinguished
service over a period of ten years as Chairman of the Advisory
Committee on Admiralty Rules. He stated that Judge Herbert
W. Christenberry has been appointed to succeed Judge Pope and
that the Advisory Committee on Admiralty Rules is continuing its
study of the operation of the Unified Federal Rules of Civil Pro­
cedure and especially the supplemental admiralty rules in cases of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. A request has been submitted
to all members of the Maritime Law Association of the United
States to furnish the Advisory Committee with their experience
in this regard. When the responses to this request have been
received, the Advisory Committee will undertake to formulate
such amendments as may be found desirable and they will. be
circulated to the bench and bar.
   The Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules is continuing the
large task of preparing rules of procedure for bankruptcy proceed­
ings and also for the various forms of debtor relief proceedings
provided by the Bankruptcy Act.
   The preliminary draft of Uniform Rules of Evidence for Fed­
eral Courts is now being circulated to the bench and bar for
comment.
                                  70 

RULES OF PROCEDURE IN HABEAS CORPUS AND SECTION 2255 CASES
   Judge Maris stated that in the opinion of the Supreme Court,
concurring in this respect with the dissenting opinion of Mr.
Justice Harlan in the case of Harris v. Nelson, 1969,394 U.S. 286,
300 (Footnote 7), it is stated to be the view of the Court that the
rule-making machinery should be invoked to formulate rules of
practice with respect to federal habeas corpus and (28 U.S.C.)
§ 2255 proceedings on a comprehensive basis and not merely con­
fined to discovery. Accordingly, the committee recommended to
the Conference that it grant authorization to prepare such rules
of procedure. The Conference agreed and concurred further in the
recommendation of the committee that the task be assigned to
the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules since both habeas
corpus and § 2255 proceedings relate in fact to and are in substance
extensions of criminal cases even though they have been treated
technically as civil proceedings.
                         ApPELLATE RULES
   Judge Maris reminded the Conference that upon the discharge
of the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules the standing Com­
mittee assumed the responsibility for the study of the operation
and improvement of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
He said that the committee has already received a number of sug­
gestions for changing the appellate rules but it determined that
most of the suggestions should await further study and experience
with the rules which have been in effect only since July 1, 1968. IJe
said that the committee did, however, propOSe immediate consid­
eration of two amendments to the appellate rules: (1) that Rule
30(c) be amended to require permission of a court of a,.ppeals before
the filing of the appendix to the briefs may be deferred, and (2) that
Rules 30(a) and 31(a) be amended to permit a court of appeals to
reduce the time allowed for filing of briefs and the appendix if
reduction of the time will expedite the hearing of argument.
   After some discussion, a change was made by the Conference in
the proposed amendment to Rule 31(a) and the Conference ap­
proved the transmission to the Supreme Court, with recommenda­
tion for approval, the following changes in the. Federal Rules of
Appellate Procedure:
                                         71 


    30(a) Duty of Appellant to Prepare and File; Content of Appendix: Time
    for Filing; Number of Copies. The appellant shall prepare and file an appendix
    to the briefs which shall contain: (1) the relevant docket entries in the pro­
    ceeding below; (2) any relevant portions of the pleadings, charge, findings
    or opinion; (3) the judgment, order or decision in question; and (4) any
    other parts of the record to which the parties wish to direct the particular
    attention of the court. The fact that parts of the record are not included in
    the appendix shall not prevent the parties or the court from relying on such
    parts.
    Unless filing is to be deferred pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (c)
    of this rule, the appellant shall serve and file the appendix 'I'I'i:thlft 4e ~
    at ~ ~ f)ft wffieft ~ l'eeeffi is mea 'with his brief. Ten copies of the ap­
    pendix shall be filed with the clerk, and one copy shall be served on counsel
    for each party separately represented, unless the court shall by rule or order
    direct the filing or service of a lesser number.
        •           •           •           •           •           •           •

    References to the Record may be Made in the Briefs When Alternative
    Method is Used. If ~ epf)elleBt sheD Be eleetr 6i' if the court shall so provide
    by rule for classes of cases or by order in specific cases, preparation of the

   days after service of the brief of the appellee, but, except for good cause
   shown, HI reply b,rief must be filed at least 3 days before argument. If a ClJurt

   are filed, and $t8 practwe is to dQ so, it may 8horten the periods prescribed
   above for 8erving and fiUng brief8, either by rule for aU Ca8es or for clas8es
   of ooses, or by order for specific cases.

                                    CIVIL RULES

   Judge Maris said that the committee had received from the Ad­
visory Committee on Civil Rules its revised draft of amendments
to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the discovery
procedure. He said that the draft had been approved by the Ad­
visory Committee in April after it had received and considered the
comments and Buggestions of the bench and bar with respect to the
preliminary draft which had been published and widely circulated
in November 1967 and after the Advisory Committee had modified
                                  72 

portions of the draft in the light of those suggestioru!. Judge Maris
stated that the standing committee carefully considered this draft
at its meeting and modified some of the Advisory Committee's pro­
posals in comparatively minor respects. He recommended to the
Conference that it approve for transmission to the Supreme Court
of the United States, with a recommendation for approval, amend­
ments to Rules 5, 9, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 45 and 69 and
Form 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Conference
approved the Committee recommendation and directed the trans­
mission of these proposed rule changes to the Supreme Court.

    COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  Chief Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee on Intercircuit Assignments covering the period
September 8,1968 to August 11,1969.
   Judge Harper stated that during the period in question the
committee recommended 54 assignments to be undertaken by 43
judges. Of this number four were circuit judges in active status, four
were senior circuit judges, 15 were district judges in active status
and 12 were senior district judges. The other assignments were by
judges of the special courts and by retired Supreme Court Justices.
   Judge Harper advised that there were 15 assignments to the
circuit courts of appeals, ten assignments to the Court of Customs
and Patent Appeals, one assignment to the Court of Claims and
28 assignments to the district courts.
           COMMITTEE ON TRIAL PRACTICE· AND
                     TECHNIQUE
   The report of the Committee on Trial Practice and Technique
was presented by its Chairman, Chief Judge Joe K Estes.
   Judge Estes stated that his committee has undertaken several
studies to develop methods and techniques of effective judicial
administration, including :first drafts of sample jury instructions to
be used in tax and antitrust cases, techniques to be used in pro­
ceedings under Rules 16 and 17.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure and is planning further studies on the use of a panel
of impartial medical experts, bifurcated trials before the same jury
of the i~sues of liability and damages, methods of achieving a specif­
jcation of issues in patent cases prior to discovery and a suggested
post-conv:iction conference in criminal cases to consider any possible
post-conviction remedies.
                                  73 

   Judge Estes further advised that studies were being undertaken
in connection with a stipulation to a verdict of less than twelve
jurors and submission of written instructions to the jury. In this
connection the Conference noted the inordinate use of jurors and
requested the committee to investigate this matter in coordination
with the Federal Judicial Center.
   Judge Estes stated that his committee is also considering the
problem of time limits in third-party practice and pretrial formula­
tion of issues.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

            BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM 

   The report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Bankruptcy System was presented by the Committee Chairman,
Judge Edward Weinfeld.
   Judge Weinfeld reported that the committee han considered
the recommendations contained in the survey report of the Director
of the Administrative Office of June 23, 1969, as well as the recom­
mendations of the circuit councils and district judges concerned,
for increases in the salaries of four full-time referees, for continu­
ance of 13 referee positions to become vacant by expiration of
term, for the creation of one additional part-time referee position
and for the designation of additional places of holding court in
one district.
                       SA~ OF REFEREES

   At the March 1969 meeting of the Conference, action was taken
to increase the salaries of referees pursuant to a report of the Presi­
dent's Salary Commission authorized under Public Law 90-206.
Not included in the Conference action in March were the Districts
of Northern Oklahoma, Western Oklahoma and Utah (Conf. Rept.,
p. 16). The Chief Judge of the Tenth Circuit had advised the com­
mittee that his judicial council now recommended immediate im­
plementation of these salary increases from $22,500 to $30,000 per
year in the districts which were omitted from the Conference action
in March. The proposal for the increases in salaries of these refer­
ees was included in a vote slip circulated among the members
of the Conference in September 1969 and approved by the Confer­
ence at that time.

                    CHANGES IN REFEREE POSITIONS

   Because the position of referee in bankruptcy at Columbus,
Georgia, was scheduled to expire on October 15, 1969, the Confer­
ence by vote slip in September approved the continuation of this
position.
   Judge Weinfeld next presented to the Conference recommenda­
tions in the survey report relating to the changes in arrangements
for the filling of vacancies in referee positions in certain districts
as approved by the district courts and the circuit councils involved.
The Conference approved each of these recommendations, to be
effective November 1, 1969 unless otherwise noted, subject to the
availability of funds.

              CoMPENSATION FOR FuLL-TIME REFEREES

  Judge Weinfeld stated that a subcommittee which he had ap­
pointed reported to the full committee on the criteria and method
of fixing the salaries of full-time referees. The subcommittee
emphasized the statement of policy approved by the Judicial
Conference at the March 1969 session to the effect that the main­
tenance of a self-supporting bankruptcy system, as contemplated
by Section 40 of the Bankruptcy Act, is no longer possible without
placing an inordinate financial burden upon bankrupts and the
assets of bankrupts. Pursuant to the subcommittee's report, the
committee recommended to the Conference and the Conference
approved a statement of policy that the present criteria for fixing
salaries of full-time referees should be eliminated from the Bank­
ruptcy Act and all full-time referees should be paid at the same
rate within the limit upon such salaries established by the Presi­
dent's Salary Commission.
                             NEW CASE FILINGS

  The decline in the filing of new bankruptcy cases noted in fiscal
year 1968 continued in fiscal year 1969. In 1967 a record number
of 20S,329 cases was filed. The number declined in 1968 to 197,799
and in 1969 to 184,930. Of the total filings during fiscal year 1969,
91.6 percent were nonbusiness bankruptcies.

                      MATTERS UNDER SUBMISSION

  The cornmittee noted a marked improvement in matters under
submission. The most recent quarterly reports show a total of only
47 matters under submission for over sixty days, the second lowest
total ever reported.
                                     77
      SOCIAL SECURITY AND        TAX   IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS

  Judge Weinfeld advised the Conference that the committee had
been informed of a request from the Internal Revenue Service for
assistance in obtaining Social Security or Tax Identification Num­
bers of bankrupts and debtors on bankruptcy notices of first meet­
ings to creditors to aid the Internal Revenue Service in locating
quickly and accurately through its automatic data processing sys­
tem the tax liability of the bankrupt or debtor and to permit the
prompt filing of claims. Pursuant to committee recommendation,
the Conference adopted the following resolution:
     ResoZved. That it is the sense of the Conference that. effective imme­
   diately. all petitions in bankruptcy or under the special relief chapters of
   the Bankruptcy Act shall contain the Social Security or tax identification
   number of the bankrupt or debtor in order that such numbers may be in­
   cluded on notices of first meetings of creditors to assist the Internal Rev­
   enue Service in the prompt and accurate filing of claimS' and the prompt
   aUowance of refunds in these proceedings.

                               LEGISLATION

   The Conference approved, in principle, Senate Joint Resolution
88 which would establish a commission to study the bankruptcy
laws. The Conference expressed a preference, however, for the com­
position of such a commission along the lines provided by the Com­
mission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries, Public
Law 90-206, rather than to require the President to appoint two
active practitioners in the field of bankruptcy law and to require
the Chief Justice to appoint two full-time referees in bankruptcy.
   The Conference approved, in principle, H.R. 6664, a bill which
would amend Section 1, 5, 32, 64 and 65 of the Bankruptcy Act
relating to partnerships and partners with the proviso that Sec­
tion 5 (d) (1) be amended to read:
      The court in which a petition is filed by or against a partner­
     ship shall have summary jurisdiction to determine upon due
     notice and hearing who are the partners thereof.
The words "upon due notice and hearing" were recommended for
insertion 88 a resul t of Conference action.
   The Conference approved, in principle, H.R. 6665 which would
authorize the bankruptcy court to determine the dischargeability
or non-dischargeability of provable debts and render judgments
thereon.
                                78 

   The Conference approved, in principle, H.R. 6792, an omnibus
bill relating to Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act.
   The Conference expressed no view on the proposals in H.R. 3676,
a bill to give priority to pension fund contributions earned within
three months of bankruptcy, inasmuch as these provisions appear
to involve matters of public policy for the determination of the
Congress.
    COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

              PROBATION SYSTEM 

   Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman, presented the com­
mittee's report.
   Judge Hoffman reminded the Conference that in September, by
vote slip, the members had approved the agenda for the Third Cir­
cuit Sentencing Institute held in mid-October at Morgantown,
West Virginia.
   Judge Hoffman advised that the Ninth Judicial Circuit was
planning to hold a sentencing institute in the spring of 1970 and
the Conference approved the proposal, noting that the agenda
would be submitted for approval at the March 1970 session of the
Conference.
   Judge Hoffman, who is also a member of the Advisory Committee
on Criminal Rules, advised the Conference that the Probation
Committee has worked in close collaboration with the Advisory
Committee in connection with changes in Rule 32 with respect to
presentence investigations and has submitted its own recommenda­
tions to the Advisory Committee for revision of the rule.
   He stated that the committee has under consideration the need
for establishing uniform policy and procedure for jurisdictional
transfers of probationers and that the committee also plans to
survey the judges of the district courts to ascertain the circum­
stances under which a probation officer routinely is present in
court and the circumstances under which each judge regards the
presence of a probation officer to be absolutely essential.
COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL MAGIS­
               TRATES ACT
 Judge William E. Doyle, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee to Implement the Federal Magistrates Act.
                                       79
                   SURVEY REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR

   Judge Doyle reminded the Conference that 28 U.S.c. 633(a) (1)
required the Director of the Administrative Office no later than
October 17, 1969 to conduct a survey to determine the number of
appointments of full-time and part-time magistrates, the loca­
tions at which they should serve and their respective salaries and
make recommendations to the Judicial Conference of the United
States. Judge Doyle presented the Director's report and recommen­
dations and requested the authority to transmit this survey report
and recommendations to the judicial councils of the circuits and to
the district courts. The Conference approved this action and re­
quested the district courts and the judicial councils to present their
comments on the survey report no later than January 1, 1970 so
that the committee at its next meeting in January 1970 might
examine the comments received and make such further recommen­
dations to the Conference as may then be indicated.
   Judge Doyle advised the Conference that his committee had
furnished the Director with certain general guidelines to assist him
in making the initial survey and later surveys as may be required.
These guidelines were in eight general categories:
    (1) Types of functions to be assigned to the magistrates;
    (2) Additional duties which 	may be assigned but are discretionary with
         the court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 6S6(b) ;
    (3) AntiCipated workload;
    (4) 	 Combination positions, as for example, combining the work of a part­
         time magistrate and a part-time referee In bankruptcy;
    (5) 	 Salary levels-since gradations or levels of salary for full-time services
         are contemplated by the statute and should be used;
    (6) Backup positions which 	the committee regards as questionable to be
         used in emergency situations;
    (7) 	 Forfeiture of collateral which is worldng w.ell in the pilot distri~; and
    (8) 	Other considerations, such as restraints in making recommendations
          in the initial survey since the system will be a continuing one and
         whereas increases in positions and salaries can easilY be made, the
         elimination of positions or decreases in salaries would be most di1Iicult.

                     CONFLICT OF INTEREST RULES

   At the March 1969 meeting the Conference adopted six regula­
tions affecting possible conflict of interest on the part of part-time
magistrates. During the course of the survey which the Adminis­
trative Office conducted, the committee became aware of the
inherent danger of retaining a part-time employee who was both
                                      80 

a confidant of the judge in handling general court business and an
advocate at the bar. Pursuant to discussion of this matter, the
Conference agreed on the following resolution:
     A part-time magistrate who is assigned additional duties under Section
   636(b) of Title 28, United States Oode, may not appear as counsel in any
   case, civil or criminal, in the district court for which he is appointed_ This
   prohibition shall not extend to a part-time magistrate whose additional
   assignments are limited to the review of prisoner petitions or service as a
   special master in a specified case.

                         COSTS OF THE SYSTEM

  Under 28 U.S.C. 634(a), as amended by the Magistrates Act,
full-time magistrates may receive up to $22,500 per annum in
salary, and part-time magistrates may receive up to $11,000 per
annum. Full-time magistrates will be provided with secretarial
assistance and other support. The statute also provides for reim­
bursement of actual and necessary expenses incurred by part-time
magistrates in the performance of their duties, in accordance with
regulations issued by the Director of the Administrative Office and
approved by the Conference. Under the present commissioner
system costs of secretarial 3.S8istance, stationery, and telephone
calls are borne by the commissioners out of their fee earnings.
Therefore, in addition to the payment of the salaries of the part­
time magistrates, the government will be assuming substantial
additional costs under the new program in the way of support
services and equipment.
  Judge Doyle advised the Conference that the Administrative
Office had prepared an estimate of the cost of establishing part­
time magistrate positions at authorized salary levels.

                             PILOT DISTRICTS

   At the March 1969 meeting the Conference agreed to the estab­
lishment of the magistrates system in five pilot districts: California,
Southern; District of Columbia; Kansas; N ew Jersey and Virginia,
Eastern. Judge Doyle stated that the system has been functioning
satisfactorily in these districts and has proved to be of substantial
assistance to the courts. The establishment of the program, how­
ever, has required more time than was anticipated, particularly in
the administrative tasks associated with setting up offices and
getting acquainted with new duties.
                                81 

 . On motion of Chief Judge Stanley of the District of Kansas,
the Conference approved an increase in the salaries of the two full­
time magistrates in Kansas from $20,000 to $22,500 with such
increases to be promulgated as required by statute on November
1,1969.
                    STANDARDS FOR SELECTION

   The Conference at the March 1969 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 31)
considered tentative standards for the pilot districts and requested
the committee to study further the problem of other standards. The
Conference reaffirmed the need of an investigation and report from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation on all applicants selected
prior to appointment. The Conference further agreed that there
should be public announcement that appointments are to be made
to the office of magistrate.
COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
                   ACT
 Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act.
                 ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

  Judge Hastings advised the Conference that the Administrative
Office had prepared a cumulative report on appointments and
payments from the effective date of the Act, August 20, 1965,
through June 30, 1969. The Conference received copies of this re­
port and authorized its dissemination to all federal judges.
  Judge Hastings advised that the statistical report of the Ad­
ministrative Office would hereafter be carried as an appendix to the
Director's Annual Report and would be published with it.
  The cumulative report shows aggregate disbursements of
$10,213,643. During the last fiscal year, Judge Hastings said, that
there was a marked increase in the volume of vouchers submit­
ted by court-appointed counsel and payments during fiscal year
1969 amounted to $4,027,671. It was necessary for the first time to
seek a supplemental appropriation in the sum of $850,000, thus
making the appropriation for the Criminal Justice Act for fiscal
year 1969 $4,000,000. He said that it is estimated that in the
current year this total will be increased by $300,000 to handle the
                                   82 

volume of vouchers expected from the Juvenile Court of the Dis'­
trict of Columbia.

                     STATUTORY AMENDMENTS

   Judge Hastings reminded the Conference that at its September
1968 session the Conference had approved numerous amendments
to the Criminal Justice Act based on a survey report prepared under
the direction of Professor Dallin Oaks of the University of Chicago
School of Law (Conf. Rept., pp. 71-73). These amendments were
incorporated in a bill introduced early in the 91st Congress by
Senator Hruska as S. 650. Later in the session Senator Hruska in­
troduced a second bill, S. 1461, incorporating the substance of the
changes approved by the Conference and contained in the earlier
bill S. 650 but making certain additional proposals relating to the
Criminal Justice Act. The principal change is a new subsection
 (h) which provides for two types of public defender organization
available for a district or the part of a district in which at least 200
defendants annually require the appointment of counseL The first
alternative is a federal public defender organization and the sec­
ond a community defender organization defined as a nonprofit
defense counsel service established and administered by any orga­
nization authorized by the district plan to provide representation.
   On committee recommendation, the Conference approved these
two types of public defender organization set forth in subsection
 (h) with certain changes relating to the administration of a public
offender office which would require the judicial council of the circuit
to approve the number of full-time attorneys to be attached to such
organization and in general to provide for the operation of such
an organization under rules and regulations issued by the Judicial
Conference of the United States.
   Judge Hastings pointed out further that S. 1461 compensates
court-appointed counsel at $20.00 per hour for all types of service.
The Conference, on recommendation of the committee, approved
$20.00 an hour as a minimum but adhered to the principle that a
distinction should be recognized between service rendered in court
and service rendered out of court and recommended, therefore, to
the Congress that this distinction be maintained in the compensa­
tion provided in S. 1461.
                                83 

                           GUIDELINES

   The committee received a report from its subcommittee which
has prepared guidelines in implementation of the Criminal Justice
Act. Judge Hastings said that his committee was not prepared to
recommend any guidelines at this time, however, because of the
likelihood of the early amendment of the Act and because full
implementation of the Magistrates Act which may occur in 1970
makes premature any issuance of guidelines at this time.
                   STATUS OF THE COMMITTEE

   Judge Hastings reminded the Conference that in adopting the
report of its Committee on Committees in September 1968, it
agreed that the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act
should be a special committee of the Conference and that the
Conference would reexamine the need for the continuation of this
special committee at its fall session in 1969 (Conf. Rept., pp. 43­
46). The Conference agreed that the work of the committee was
not finished and that it would be awkward at this time to transfer
its duties to any other committee. It voted, therefore, to continue
this special committee in existence for one additional year, at
which time the need to continue the committee would again be
considered.
                JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
   Because of the necessity of filing the budget request for fiscal
year 1971 with the Bureau of the Budget on or before October 15,
it was necessary to obtain Conference approval of the proposed
budget by mail. Judge Weinman, Chairman of the Committee, re­
ported that this was accomplished and the budget wa.s duly
submitted.
   Judge Weinman stated that Congress in the Annual Appropri­
ation Act of 1969, Public Law 90-470, approved August 9, 1968,
appropriated for the judiciary, exclusive of the Supreme Court,
$100,429,500. An additional $6,552,500 was provided in the Second
Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1969 which included $4,907,400
for pay costs. Thus, the obligational authority for fiscal year 1969
(exclusive of the Supreme Court) was $106,982,000, whereas the
cost of operating the courts in that year was $106,345,000, leaving
a prospective unobligated balance of $637,000. The Supplemental
                                 84 

Appropriation Act contained provisions which made the funds
included therein available for obligation for certain limited periods
in fiscal year 1970.
   The budget estimates for the judiciary, exclusive of the Supreme
Court, for fiscal year 1970, as submitted to the Bureau of the
Budget in October 1968 and to the Congress in January 1969,
were in the total amount of $114,145,000. Subsequently, the esti­
mates were amended to include an additional $7,466,400 to cover
increases in salaries granted to judges, referees in bankruptcy and
other executives.
   The Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 1970, as approved by the
House of Representatives, contains obligational authority in the
amount of $117,694,000 for the judiciary, exclusive of the Supreme
Court. This is an increase of $10,712,000 over the adjusted appro­
priations for 1969 but $3,917,400 less than the amended budget
estimates. Judge Weinman advised the Conference that as of the
time of the meeting the Appropriation Bill was still before the Sen­
a,te for action.
   The bill, as approved by the House of Representatives, for fiscal
year 1970 provides for the appointment of 18 additional clerks for
the courts of appeals and continuing authority for 83 deputy
clerks (out of a request for 166) for the district courts provided
in the Second Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1969. Funds also
were provided for the reclassification of law clerks and secretary­
law clerks under the revised standards adopted by the Judicial
Conference. Six additional positions for the Administratice Office
were also authorized but a request for 33 stenographers for the
courts of appeals was denied as was a request for 39 additional
deputy clerks for the district courts to cope with increased work­
loads. No funds were allowed for additional referees nor for cleri­
cal positions for referees' offices.
   J udge Weinman stated that supplemental requests for pay costs
for fiscal year 1970 will be required and that it will be necessary
to seek supplemental appropriations of $549,000 for salaries and ex­
penses of United States magistrates in the pilot districts, an addi­
tional $800,000 for fees and allowances of jurors and $1,150,000
for fees and expenses of court-appointed counsel ($850,000 to cover
a deficiency resulting from increases in the volume of appointments
and average cost per case, plus $300,000 for fees and expenses of
court-appointed counsel in the Juvenile Court for the District
of Columbia.)
                                  85 


   Judge Weinman stated that the budget estimates for fiscal year
'1971, which had already been approved by the Conference by mail
vote, aggregate for the judiciary, exclusive of the Supreme Court,
the Customs Court and the Federal Judicial Center, a total of
$124,957,400, an increase of $4,324,400 over the amounts appro~
priated for 1970 adjusted to reflect proposed supplementals for
pay costs.
   The budget estimates for 1971, Judge Weinman stated, include
funds for an anticipated increase of five in the average number of
senior judges to be carried on the rolls. It also includes funds for
the employment of 32 additional deputy clerks for the courts of
appeals. Judge Weinman pointed out that the sum $549,000 under
the caption "Salaries and Expenses, United States Magistrates,"
is intended to cover only the salaries and expenses of the magis­
trates in the five pilot districts. This item will subsequently have
to be amended to include funds to implement the Magistrates Act
fully. The additional sum will have to be calculated after the Judi­
cial Conference has determined the number of full-time and part­
time magistrates to be authorized. It is also proposed that the ap~
propriation for court-appointed counsel will have to be increased
by $850,000 to provide sufficient funds for payments of fees and
expenses of court-appointed counsel incurred during fiscal year
1971. An additional sum of $300,000 will have to be sought for
counsel to be appointed for the Juvenile Court of the DistrIct of
Columbia. Because the current limitations on the aggregate sal~
aries of secretaries and law clerks to district judges preclude the
appointment of crier-law clerks in Grade JSP 9 if the district judges'
law clerk and secretary are classified in Grades JSP 12 and JSP
10, respectively, it is also proposed that the limitations, including
the limitation applicable to chief judges in district courts with five
or more judges, be increased to the extent of $1,463.00.

               COMMENTS ON LEGISLATION
  Chief Judge Bazelon recommended to the Conference that an
expression of Conference views should be made on an amendment
to S. 3016, then pending in the House of Representatives, which
would give the governor of each state an item veto over legal
service programs in his state. It would also remove the power of
the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity to override a
governor's veto. Judge Bazelon reminded the Conference that fed~
                                 86 

eral courts are authorized to appoint counsel for indigents in civil
as well as criminal cases, and, therefore, an expression of Conference
views would be appropriate. He moved that because of the amend­
ment's potential impact upon the administration of civil justice
in the federal courts, the Conference should disapprove the
proposed amendment. The Conference concurred in this
recommendation.

                ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
   The Chief Justice suggested to the Conference that he thought
it would be helpful in the administration of the affairs of the
Conference if an Executive Committee not to exceed five members
were to be created. The Conference concurred in this suggestion
and approved the establishment of an Executive Committee.
   The Chief Justice stated that he also would like to appoint an
ad hoc committee for the purpose of reporting to the Conference
at the March 1970 session on questions of jurisdiction among the
several committees of the Conference. This ad hoc committee would
be requested to furnish definitions and guidelines as to the activ­
ities of the Conference committees. The Conference concurred in
this suggestion.

PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS
   At the request of Chief Judge Van Oosterhout, the Conference,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, consented to the pretermission of the
terms of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to be held
in 1970 anywhere except in St. Louis, Missouri.

           RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
on matters considered at this session where necessary for legislative
or administrative action.
  For the Judicial Conference of the United States.
