REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE 

     OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS 


   Mr. William E. Foley, Acting Director of the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts, reported to the Conference on
the business of the United States courts during the first half of the
fiscal year 1970.
   Mr. Foley indicated that during the half-year period from July 1
through December 31, 1969, there was a 14 percent increase in the
number of appeals docketed in the United States courts of appeals.
During this period there were 5,600 appeals filed compared with
4,908 appeals filed during the same period the previous year. While
appeals disposed of also increased, the number terminated was more
than 1,000 less than the number filed and the number of pending
appeals increased to 8,894, compared with 7,540 pending a year ago.
   In the United States district courts civil cases filed during the 6­
month period increased 15 percent over the similar period last year.
Total civil cases filed were 42,361 compared with 36,705 filed a year
ago. Criminal case filings increased to 18,740 during the half-year
period, up 12 percent from the 16,719 filed during the same period a
year ago. Civil cases disposed of were 4,000 less than the number
filed and the number pending on December 31, 1969 climbed to 90,­
392-a new record high. Criminal cases disposed of were 1,500 less
than filings and the number of criminal cases pending on December
31,1969, exceeded 20,000.
   The increase in civil case filings in the district courts during the
first half of the fiscal year resulted primarily from large increases in
civil suits under Title III of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act
of 1966, the Civil Rights Act, and petitions by persons confined in
state and federal penal institutions. The increase in criminal cases
results largely from an increase in the number of auto theft cases
and in the prosecution of violations involving the rules and regula­
tions governing weapons and firearms.

                 FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER

  Mr. Justice Clark, Director of the Federal Judicial Center, re­
ported to the Conference on the operation of the Center from Oc­
tober 1969 to March 1970. He noted that the budget for the fiscal
year 1970 was finally approved at $600,000, double the previous
year. Justice Clark reported on the adoption of the individual cal­
     381-989--70----2
                                         4


endar system in several district courts, the programs being carried
on in the courts of appeals designed to expedite the disposition of
cases, various research projects undertaken by the Center, and the
education and training programs recently conducted, including a
seminar for newly appointed United States district judges and two
seminars for judges of the United States courts of appeals. He also
described several innovative projects in which the Center was en­
gaged and gave a report on publications and special activities.

                                NEW DIRECTOR

  The Chief Justice announced that Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit had
been selected by the Board to be the new Director of the Federal
Judicial Center succeeding Justice Tom C. Clark. Judge Murrah
will assume his new duties very shortly. The Conference thereupon
adopted the following resolution:
   Gratefully and with affection and respect, the Judicial Conference of the United
States salutes Mr. Justice Tom C. Clark as he retires from his o1fice as the first
Director of the Federal Judicial Center. Blending wisdom, innovative imagination
and practicality. he has quickly transformed the concept of 'a Federal Judicial
Center into a useful and effective instrumentaUty for stimulating, supporting,
organizing, and administering important study, research and action projects, all
calculated to improve the functioning of the COUI"ts of the United States. It is a
measure of the stature of Justice Clark and the confidence he inspires that he
quickly won and mobilized the wholehearted support of Congress and the Execu­
tive, as well as the Judiciary. Whatever the Federal Judicial Center may accom­
plish in the future, its success will continue to be attributable in large measure
to the sound and confidence-inspiring beginning of this enterprise under the direc­
tion of Justice Clark.

                      ELECTION OF BOARD MEMBER

   The Conference was advised that the 2-year term of Judge
William A. McRae, Jr. of the Middle District of Florida as a mem­
ber of the Board of the Federal Judicial Center would terminate
on March 28. Upon recommendation of a special committee ap­
pointed by the Chief Justice to propose a successor, the Conference
elected Judge Gerhard A. Gesell of the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia to a 4-year term as a member
of the Board commencing March 28. The Conference extended
its appreciation to Judge McRae for the service which he rendered
to the Center and to the judiciary as a member of the Board dur­
ing the last 2 years.
                                  5

  JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION

   Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Chairman of the Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation, reported on the transfer of cases by
the panel during the period July 1 through December 31, 1969.
   Judge Murrah stated that during this period the Panel trans­
ferred 173 civil actions from one district to another for coordinated
or consolidated pretrial proceedings, bringing to 540 the total
number of transfers made by the Panel since the enactment of
the new law, 28 U.S.C. 1407. The 173 cases transferred include
135 so-called tag-along cases filed after the original transfers made
by the Panel. The other 38 cases involve seven new groups of
multidistrict litigation.
   The Conference discussed various problems that have arisen in
regard to the filing of class actions pursuant to Rule 23, Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. It was recommended that a study be
made of class actions, particularly in regard to the amount of
lawyers' fees and the improper solicitation of cases. In this regard,
the attention of the Conference was directed to a new local rule
of court adopted in the United States District Court for the North­
ern District of Texas relating to class actions.

                JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS

   Chief Judge Carl A. Weinman, Chairman of the standing Com­
mittee of the Conference on the Budget, presented a brief oral
report to the Conference on the status of the appropriations bill
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971. The Conference was in­
formed that the hearings on the bill had been completed in the
House of Representatives and that a report by the Appropriations
Committee would be made in due course.
   The Conference approved the making of a request for a supple­
mental appropriations for the fiscal year 1971 in such amount as
may be necessary to finance the establishment of the United States
magistrate positions which were approved by the Conference at
this session. The Committee was authorized to request such an
appropriation.
                                        6

     JURISDICTION OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEES
   Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard, Chairman of a special com­
mittee appointed to consider guidelines relating to the jurisdiction
of committees of the Judicial Conference and jurisdiction and pro­
cedures for Conference action on legislative proposals and other
matters on which Conference action is requested, reported the
view of the Committee that no purpose would be served by attempt­
ing to define the jurisdiction of the committees of the Conference
beyond the description contained in the report of the Committee
on Committees which was approved by the Conference at its
September 1968 session (Conf. Rept., p. 43). The Committee sug­
gested that any question regarding jurisdiction and action by the
Conference might best be determined by an executive committee
of the Conference to be appointed by the Chief Justice.
   After a full discussion the Conference approved the recom­
mendation of the Committee and authorized the Chief Justice to
appoint a standing committee of the Conference, to be called
the Executive Committee, to consist of as many members as he
may determine. The Executive Committee would be charged with
the following duties:
  To advise upon any question relating to the jurisdiction of the committees of
the Conference and determine such question between meetings of the Conference;
  To determine whether any matter not considered and reported upon by a com­
mittee of the Conference should be considered by the Conference. If the Executive
Committee is of the view that such matter should be referred to a committee
before presentation to the Conference, then such matter shall not be considered
by the Conference, prior to a committee report thereon, except upon a three­
fourths vote of the members of the Conference;
  To consult with the Chief Justice at his request.

       COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
 Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
Court Administration, presented the Committee's report.

                          FINANCIAL REPORTING

  Judge Ainsworth reported to the Conference that pursuant to
the resolution of November 1, 1969 (O:)11f. Rept., p. 52), a pro­
posed financial statement, together with a procedure for its imple­
mentation was transmitted to all Federal judges with a request for
                                          7

their comments. These comments, as well as the Conferencereso­
lution of November 1, 1969 (Conf. Rept., p. 51), concerning re­
ports with respect to compensation for nonjudicial services, were
considered by a subcommittee of the Committee on Court Admin­
istration. He advised that his Committee, after consideration and
discussion of the subcommittee's report, recommended to the Con­
ference a new reporting form which would require that all Federal
judges, including judges in senior status performing some judicial
services, report every 6 months, commencing with the period end­
ing June 30, 1970, for the preceding 6 months, as to monies received
from extrajudicial services, gifts, payments of excess expenses, po­
sitions held in business or other organizations and participation in
cases where the judge had any financial interest. He said that the
Committee recommended that copies of these reports be filed
within 30 days after the end of the reporting period with the Re­
view Committee of the Judicial Conference, now chaired by Judge
Edward A. Tamm; with the judicial council of the circuit, or the
appropriate court; and with the office of the clerk of court of which
the judge is a member, where they will be made available to the
public immediately.
   The Conference after considering these recommendations voted
its approval of them and adopted the reporting form set forth

 A. 	 State your total income for all extrajudicial services performed. by you, in­
      cluding lecturing, teaching, writing, serving as a trustee, executor or direc­
      tor, and all other services performed by you. (If none, write "N<me.")
 B. 	 AB to any such income from a single source in excess of $100, list and de­
      scribe !!!eparately the service!!! rendered, specifying the amount of time spent
      on each matter and the compensation received for each matter.
                                          8

II. GIFTS
       List and describe separately each gift received by you or your spouse or any
       member of your immediate family in your household during the period
       which had a Wilue in excess of $100. Gifts received from a member of your
       immedia te family (e.g., parents, spouse, children and sibling!l) may be
       excluded. For each gift, state .the donor and your best estimate of its value.
        (If none, write "None.")
III. 	EXCESS EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT
       List and describe separately all reimbursements for your nonfederal ex­
       penses which exceeded the actual out-of-pocket cost of those expenses, in­
       cluding any such excess reimbursement which was paid to members of your
       family or staff who were accompanying you. For each instance, state the
       source and the amount of the excess reimbursement. (If none, write
       "None.")
IV. 	PARTICIPATION IN CASES
  A. 	 Have you participated in the hearing or decision of any case, knowing at
       the time of such participation that you, your spouse, or any member of your
       immediate family in your household had a financial interest in any of the
       named partie!l? If so, state the name of the case, the nature and amount
       of the interest, the amount in issue in the case, and the reasons why you
       deemed it proper to participate. (If none, write "None.")
          Note: This statement relating to "participation" is in terms of "know­
       ingly participated" for the following reason: The Conference recognizes
       that because of the existence of many mutual and diversified investment
       funds, large conglomerates and trusts having a wide range of investments
       and affiliates, there may be cases in which a "named party" may own in­
       terests in a corporation, ,but Which ownership is not known to the judge
       who (or whose spouse or family member in his household) may also be a
       stockholder of such corporation. The Conference recognizes tha.t without
       knowledge of such stock ownership ,by the party, the judge's action could
       not be affected by this fact. Thus, the report to be made under this require­
       ment relates only to the "knowing" participation by the judge. In this para­
       graph IV the term "party" does not include the U.S. government.
  B. 	 Have you engaged in any transaction involving the securities or other prop­
       erty of a party to a case while that case was pending before you? If so, for
       each such transaction state the name of the case, the nature and amount
       of the transaction, the amount in issue in the case, and any explanation you
       may wish to make. (If none, write "None.")
  C. 	Have you participated in the hearing or decision of 'any case at a time when
       you knew that your spouse or any member of your immediate family in your
       household was an officer or employee of any named party in the case? If so,
       state the name of the case and why you deemed it proper to participate. (If
       none, write "None.")
V. POSITIONS HELD DURING REPORTING PERIOD
  A. 	List all positions held by you in any organization, business or charitable,
       such as an officer, director or trustee, regardless of whether any compensa­
       tion was received therefor. (If none, write "None.")
  B. 	List all other fiduciary positions, such as trustee or executor. (If none, write
       "None.")

    *	                 '"                 '" 	               *                  '"

   I certify that the above statement is accurate, true and complete to the best
of my knowledge and belief.

   Judge Ainsworth stated that his Committee recommended that
no other financial reporting form be required, whether of assets and
liabilities or otherwise, pending the completion of the report of the
Committee of the American Bar Association which was created in
1969 to revise the standards of judicial conduct. The Conference was
in agreement that it would be premature and inadvisable to suggest
additional reporting pending a study of the recommendations of
the American Bar Association Committee.
   Judge Edward A. Tamm, Chairman of the Review Committee,
reported to the Conference on the activities of his Committee and
Judge William B. Jones, a member of the Interim Advisory Com­
mittee on Judicial Activities, reported on the activities of that Com­
mittee in the absence of the Chairman, Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, who
was unable to be presen t.

                    JUDICIAL REFORM ACT OF 1969

   Judge Ainsworth informed the Conference that all technical
changes required to be made in S. 1511, 91st Congress, to amend the
Judicial Survivors Annuity Act, have been made, but that the bill
is still pending before the Senate Subcommittee on Improvements
in Judicial Machinery.
   The provisions of S. 1511 are also included in S. 1506, 91st Con­
gress, as Title III. The provisions of Title I and Title II of S. 1506
relating to the creation of a National Commission on Judicial
Disability, which were referred back to the Committee by the
Conference at its session in October 1969 (Conf. Rept., p. 53), re­
main under study. A report will be made at the next session of the
Conference.
   Title V of S. 1506 would incorporate the provisions of S. 1514,
91st Congress, to provide membership of district judges on the
judicial councils of the circuits. After full consideration the Con­
ference voted unanimously to disapprove this proposed legislation.
   The proposal contained in S. 1507, 91st Congress, to provide
for the mandatory retirement of justices and judges at age 70
remains under consideration by the subcommittee and a report will
be made at a later date.
                                 10 


   S. 1513, 91st Congress, would amend 28 U.S.C. 294, to authorize
the assignment of duties to a judge who was retired involuntarily
under Section 372(b). The Committee recommended approval of
the bill provided that it is amended to provide for a certificate
concerning the retired judge's ability to perform judicial duties.
The Conference, after full discussion, concluded that the pro­
visions of S. 1513 are declaratory of existing law and that the bill
is not needed.

    ADDITIONAL DIVISIONS AND PLACES OF HOLDING COURT


   H.R. 5981, 91st Congress, would transfer Madison County from
the Middle District to the Northern District of Florida. The
Conference was informed that the bill had been approved by the
judges of the districts affected and by the Judicial Council of the
Fifth Circuit. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference approved the bill.
   The Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit and the judges of the
Middle and Southern Districts of Florida have recommended the
transfer of Lee and Charlotte Counties from the Middle District
to the Southern District of Florida, and the transfer of Highlands
County from the Southern District to the Middle District of
Florida. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved a draft bill submitted by the Committee and directed
that it be transmitted to the Congress.
   S. 2998 and H.R. 13853, 91st Congress, would provide for the
holding of court at Hempstead in the Eastern District of New York.
Both bills have been disapproved by the Judicial Council of the
Second Circuit. The Conference, upon recommendation of the
Committee, voted to disapprove the bills.
   The Conference voted to take no action with respect to S. 3099,
S. 3079, and H.R. 13563, 91st Congress, to provide for the holding
of court at Allentown in the Eastern District of Pensylvania pend­
ing receipt of the views of the Judicial Council of the Third Circuit.
   The Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit and the judges of the
Southern District of Mississippi have approved S. 3122, 91st Con­
gress, to provide for the holding of court at Gulfport, and S. 3255,
91st Congress, to provide for the holding of court at Natchez. The
Conference voted to approve both bills, provided that the holding
of court at Natchez be without cost to the United States.
                                   11 


                         HEARING EXAMINERS


   H.R. 14688, 91st Congress, would redesignate hearing examiners
as "administrative trial judges." The Conference at its September
1966 session (Conf. Rept., p. 40) expressed the opinion that the
designation "hearing examiner" is well understood and that the
proposed change would be inappropriate and confusing. The Con­
ference was informed that the Administrative Conference of the
United States at its October 1969 session disapproved the change
in the title of ((hearing examiner." After further consideration, the
Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of this legislation.

                        SUPPORTING PERSONNEL


   Clerks of court.-The Committee reported that requests for
additional clerical positions in the offices of the clerks of the courts
of appeals, which were not funded in the fiscal year 1970, have
been included in the appropriations request for the fiscal year
1971, together with requests for additional positions not received
in time to be included in the fiscal year 1970 appropriations bill.
No request has been made in the 1971 appropriations for addi­
tional personnel in the offices of the clerks of the district courts
in view of the action taken by the Conference at its last session
requesting the chief judges of the district courts to submit to the
Administrative Office, no later than May 1, 1970, a 5-year pro­
jection of personnel requirements. The Committee will report on
the results obtained from these projections at the next session
of the Conference.
   Secretaries to judges.-J udge Ainsworth informed the Confer­
ence that the Subcommittee on Supporting Personnel has con­
tinued to study the question of increasing salaries of secretaries
to judges. At its last meeting the subcommittee received a report
indicating that 20 out of the last 25 secretaries appointed by
judges received considerably more pay with the courts than they
had received in their previous positions. The figures, however,
represented basic pay rates and did not include bonuses and other
fringe benefits normally associated with private industry. The sub­
committee is currently taking steps to obtain information from the
larger law firms regarding salaries paid to secretaries in metropoli­
tan areas.
     381-989--70----3
                                  12 


   The Committee recommended, however, that the Conference
endorse legislation to place the retirement annuities of secretaries
to judges on the same basis as the retirement of congressional
secretaries and that the Director of the Administrative Office be
authorized to express the views of the Conference to the Congress.
This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
   Crier-secretary.-The Conference, upon recommendation of the
Committee, disapproved a proposal to establish a position of crier­
secretary to a district judge.
   Court criers.-Judge Ainsworth reported that the Committee
was of the view that Grade JSP 5 constitutes a fair and adequate
compensation for the duties of the position of court crier and that
no change in grade classification should be made at this time. The
Conference, after full consideration, voted to approve a new classi­
fication of crier-clerk at one step higher than the present classifica­
tion of court crier. To be eligible for this position the judge must
certify that the crier-clerk is performing clerical duties in addition
to those of court crier.
   Interpreters.-Upon recommendation of the Committee, the
Conference approved the establishment of the position of Spanish
Interpreter in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York.
   Librarians.-The Committee reported that most of the courts
of appeals have skilled personnel in charge of libraries who are
either persons trained in library science, or lawyers who have for
a long period of time devoted their efforts to the duties of a li­
brarian. The Committee, accordingly, is considering the need for
a reclassification of these positions to a higher grade and has re­
quested the Subcommittee on Supporting Personnel to report on
this matter at the next Committee meeting so that a definite rec­
ommendation may be made to the Conference at its next session.
   Secretary-law clerk.-The Director of the Administrative Office
had determined that experience as a legal secretary is not equiva­
lent to a formal legal education and admission to the bar under
the Judicial Conference qualification standards for secretary-law
clerk. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved the position taken by the Director.
   Reporter-secretary.-Upon recommendation of the Committee,
the Conference authorized the creation of the position of reporter­
secretary to Chief Judge Fred M. Taylor of the District of Idaho.
                                 13
                     ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

   The Conference was informed that the quadrennial survey of the
need for additional judgeships in the United States courts of ap­
peals is now underway and that a report will be made to the
Conference at its next session.
  Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference dis­
approved both the proposal to increase the number of additional
judgeships recommended for the Northern District of California
from two to three, and the proposal contained in H.R. 11510, 91st
Congress, to provide for the appointment of an additional judge­
ship for the Middle District of Tennessee. The Committee had
reported that there is no indication that an emergency situation
exists in these districts at this time to require the consideration of
district judgeship needs other than at the time of the quadrennial
survey.
   The Conference was advised that the House-passed version of
the omnibus judgeship bill, S. 952, 91st Congress, did not contain
provision for seven district judgeship positions which the Confer­
ence had recommended. The Conference, thereupon, reaffirmed its
approval of these judgeships and recommended that they be re­
stored to the bill by the Senate-House conferees.
                       LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

   H.R. 13988, 91st Congress, would amend certain titles of the
United States Code to codify recent law and improve the Code
without making any substantive change in existing law. Upon rec­
ommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the bill.
  H.R. 14955, 91st Congress, would prohibit the use of the names
of certain deceased servicemen unless the consent to such use is
given by the next-of-kin of the servicemen. This bill appears to be
a matter of legislative policy and the Conference voted to take no
position with respect to it.
  The Conference voted to approve in principle H.R. 4155 and
H.R. 10124, 91st Congress, insofar as these bills would extend the
time for filing tort actions by persons under the age of 21, impris­
oned under a criminal charge, or under other legal disability at the
time their claims accrue, but suggested that consideration be given
to an over-all limitation on the length of time permitted for filing
iuch claims against the United States.
                                14 

  Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference voted
to take no position on H.R. 11656 and H.R. 14330, 91st Congress,
to provide Federal jurisdiction for certain types of consumer class
actions, since this is primarily a matter of legislative policy.
  The Conference, upon recommendation of the Committee, voted
to approve in principle a proposed convention, submitted by the
Department of State, relating to the taking of evidence abroad in
civil or commercial matters. The convention would provide for the
taking of evidence abroad on a reciprocal basis.
      DIVISION OF JURISDICTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND
                        FEDERAL COURTS

   The American Law Institute Study of the Division of Jurisdic­
tion Between State and Federal Courts had previously been re­
ferred to the bench and bar with a request for comment. The Com­
mittee reported, however, that the responses to this request have
been extremely limited. It was the view of the Committee that
because of the nature of the proposals contained in the ALII study,
a much wider comment on the part of the Federal judiciary is de­
sirable. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that a letter be
sent over the signature of the Chief Justice to the chief judge of
each circuit urging serious consideration and comment on the ALI
proposals in accordance with the previous request of the Confer­
ence. The Committee will give further consideration to the pro­
posals and submit its recommendations to the Conference at a
later date. This recommendation was approved by the Conference.
             CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY

   The Chairman of the Special Committee of the American Bar
Association to Secure Adoption of the Code of Professional Re­
sponsibility had suggested that the Conference give consideration
to the adoption of the Code in the Federal courts. The Committee
had noted, however, that there are a few areas in which the Code
differs from the position taken by the Conference in adopting the
report on "Free Press-Fair Trial" at its September 1968 session
(Conf. Rept., p. 66). The Committee recommended that the Ad­
ministrative Office examine the Code and point out any differences
that may exist between the Code and the Free Press-Fair Trial
report, and that thereafter the Director of the Administrative Of­
                                       15 

fice notify all judges that the Conference has noted the promulga­
tion of the new ABA Code) and recommends that district and
circuit courts review their local rules in light of the new Code, not­
ing, however, the report of the Administrative Office as to those
portions of the Code which may differ from Conference-approved
policy.
    COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

                CRIMINAL LAW 


  Judge George C. Edwards, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on
the Administration of the Criminal Law, presented the report of
the Committee.
                     EXPEDITION OF CRIMINAL CASES

   Judge Edwards informed the Conference that lists of criminal
cases pending in the district courts more than one year as of De­
cember 31, 1969 had been distributed by the Administrative Office
to the chief judges of the circuits, to the chief judges of the district
courts, to the Attorney General of the United States, and to the
United States attorneys in accordance with a previous resolution
of the Conference (Conf. Rept., Oct. 1969, p. 62). Several inquiries
and reports concerning this distribution have been received, but
it is too early to tell what effect the resolution of the Conference
may have on the prompt disposition of these older cases.
   The Conference considered the problem of delay in the prep­
aration of transcripts in criminal cases for purposes of appeal and
voted to adopt the following resolution:
  The Conference declares that the highest priority should be given to the
preparation of transcripts in criminal cases and to effect this pollcy requests
the judicial council of each circuit to promulgate and file with the Administra­
tive Office of the United States Courts appropriate circuit plans for districts
within the circuit, giving preference to, and otherwise expediting preparation of
transcripts in all criminal cases where they are necessary.

   The Conference also requested its Committee on Rules of Prac­
tice and Procedure to give consideration to amendments to the
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to include measures for
the expeditious disposition of appeals which are jurisdictionally
defective or which present questions which are so insubstantial
as not to need further argument.
                                  16 

ApPEAL BY A DEFENDANT FOLLOWING ENTRY OF A GUILTY PLEA

  Judge Edwards reported that the Committee had circularized to
the chief judges of the district courts a proposal to permit an appeal
by a defendant in a criminal case from the denial of his motion
to suppress evidence, or for the return of seized property, pro­
vided a guilty plea was entered. The response was favorable. The
Conference discussed the proposal at length and voted to recom­
mit the proposal to the Committee and to the Advisory Committee
on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for further study.

                      REVIEW OF SENTENCES


  Judge Edwards informed the Conference that the bill, H.R. 6188,
91st Congress, to provide for the appellate review of sentences, had
been referred to a subcommittee for study in accordance with
the action by the Conference at its last session (Con£. Rept., p. 63).
A further report will be made at the next session of the Conference.

                      CRIMINAL ApPEALS ACT


   The Bureau of the Budget had requested the views of the Con­
ference on a proposal of the Department of Justice to amend 18
U.S.C. 3731, by striking out the list of specific instances in which
an appeal by the United States is permitted and substituting
general language permitting an appeal by the United States in all
cases from a judgment or order dismissing an indictment or infor­
mation or terminating a prosecution in favor of a defendant (ex­
cept in a case of acquittal). Upon recommendation of the Commit­
tee the Conference approved the proposed legislation.

                        BAIL REFORM ACT


  Judge Edwards reported that the Committee has before it two
additional bills relating to bail reform on which the views of the
Conference had been requested by Senator Ervin. In view of
previous Conference action on similar bills, the Committee made
no further recommendation for Conference action at this time.
                                  17 

  INSTITUTE FOR CONTINUING STUDIES OF JUVENILE JUSTICE


   The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives had
requested the views of the Conference on H.R. 14950, 91st Con­
gress, to amend Title 18 of the United States Code by adding a new
Chapter 404 to establish an Institute for Continuing Studies of
Juvenile Justice. While there appeared to be no objection to the
bill, the Conference agreed that this subject is a matter on which
the Conference has no recommendation to make.

                        EXPEDITING TRIALS


   The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives also
requested the views of the Conference on H.R. 14822, 91st Con­
gress, which is a bill to assist in reducing crime by requiring speedy
trials of persons charged with violations of federal criminal laws,
and for other purposes. Title I of this bill would require that trials
be commenced within 120 days, or in cases of crimes of violence,
within 60 days. Sanctions in the nature of the dismissal of the
indictment or information, or a criminal contempt proceeding
against the defendant or his counsel, could be imposed. It was
brought to the attention of the Conference that the new adminis­
trative procedure requiring a review by the district courts of cases
pending more than one year had just begun and that favorable
results are anticipated. Upon recommendation of the Committee
the Conference disapproved Title I of the bill.
   Title II would amend the Bail Reform Act to authorize pretrial
supervision of a person charged with a crime of violence as may
be necessary to assure the safety of others or the community. The
supervision would be conducted by a United States marshal or
other organization designated by the court. The bill would also
provide for the establishment, on a demonstration basis, in five dis­
tricts and the District of Columbia, of a pretrial services agency
to provide supportive services to defendants under the Bail
Reform Act. Upon recommendation of the Committee the Con­
ference approved only so much of this title as relates to pretrial
services agencies and specifically endorses such agencies for estab­
lishment and funding by Congress.
                                   18
                       CONTROL OF VVEAPONS

   Judge Edwards informed the Conference that the Judiciary Com­
mittee of the House of Representatives had requested its views on
H.R. 5583, 91st Congress, which is a bill to amend Title 18, United
States Code, to strengthen and clarify the law prohibiting the in­
troduction, or manufacture for introduction, of switchblade knives
into interstate commerce. The Conference voted to approve the
bill.
                  ORGANIZED CRIME LEGISLATION

   The Conference wa·s informed that the Judiciary Committee of
the House of Representatives had requested its views on the
Senate-passed bill, S. 30, 9Ist Congress, relating to the control of or­
ganized crime in the United States. Upon recommendation of the
Committee the Conference separately considered each title of the
bilL
   Title I contains provisions relating to the procedures and func­
tions of federal grand juries which were previously disapproved by
the Conference (Conf. Rept., Oct. 1969, p. 67).
   Title II would make uniform a large number of immunity stat­
utes. Its provisions are substantially identical to those contained
in H.R. 11157, 91st Congress, which was approved by the Confer­
ence at the October 1969 session (Conf. Rept., p. 64). Upon rec­
ommendation of the Committee the Conference reaffirmed its ap­
proval of this proposal.
   Title III would authorize the commitment of a recalcitrant wit­
ness who refuses to testify. The Conference approved the recom­
mendation of the Committee disapproving this proposal as
unnecessary in that the normal powers of the court are sufficient to
deal with the recalcitrant witness who has been accorded immunity.
This title would also prohibit the interstate flight by a witness who
is to appear before a State investigating agency. It was the view of
the Committee that this provision would place an excessive burden
on Federal law enforcement officials and would have a great po­
tential of abuse, unless it was restricted to the area of organized
crime. Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved the proposal only to the extent that it applies to investi­
gations of organized crime.
                                   19 

   Title IV would provide criminal penalties for making false dec­
larations in any proceeding before any court or grand jury of the
United States. It was the view of the Committee that the language
of the bill would have greater clarity if the words "false statements
of material fact" were substituted for "materially false declara­
tions." The Conference agreed with the suggestion of the Com­
mittee and approved this title of the bill with the suggested
amendment.
   Title V provides for special housing facilities for the protection of
government witnesses. The Conference voted to make no recom­
mendation with respect to this proposal.
   Title VI would provide for the taking of depositions in criminal
cases. It was the view of the Conference that depositions fall
within the rule-making function and should not be made the sub­
ject of legislation. Accordingly, the subject matter of this title was
referred to the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure for its consideration.
   Title VII, relating to litigation concerning sources of evidence,
would, among other things, exclude objections to evidence of an
event on the grounds that such evidence was unlawfully obtained
or given under compulsion and grant of immunity if the unlawful
acts or the compulsion and immunity occurred more than 5 years
before the event. The Conference discussed the proposal, but voted
to take no position with respect to it.
   Title VIII would provide penalties for syndicated gambling.
The Conference voted to take no position with respect to the pro­
visions of this title.
   Title IX would amend the Criminal Code to include a new chap­
ter relating to racketeer-influenced and corrupt organizations. The
Committee recommended that the various sections of the Chapter
be approved except the proposed Section 1966 relating to the ex­
pedition of actions, and Section 1967 relating to evidence, the lat­
ter on the basis that it would require all depositions and other
ancillary civil proceedings to be open to the public. This recom­
mendation was approved by the Conference.
   Title X would provide special sentencing procedures for habit­
ual or dangerous offenders. After full discussion the Conference
voted to approve the principle of special sentencing for danger­
ous offenders, but was of the view that provisions of this nature
     381-989--70----4
                                  20 

should be the subject of over-all legislation dealing with sentencing
and should not be included in a special statute.
  The Conference voted to make no recommendation on the pro­
posed Section 3578 to establish a federal depository for conviction
records.
                         DRUG LEGISLATION

  Judge Edwards brought to the attention of the Conference S.
3246, 91st Congress, which is the so-called "Controlled Dangerous
Substances Act of 1969." The Conference discussed the bill, but
voted to take no action with respect to it at this time.

   COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY
                  SYSTEM
   Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman of the Committee on the
Operation of the Jury System, presented the report of the Com­
mittee. Judge Kaufman informed the Conference that most of the
items in the report of the Committee were informational and did
not require action by the Conference at this time. Two items, how­
ever, did require action by the Conference.

                        JUROR UTILIZATION

   The Committee recommended that the Conference authorize
distribution to the district courts of a report, prepared in the Ad­
ministrative Office, which describes the operation of a "jury pool"
and makes suggestions concerning its use. Judge Kaufman de­
scribed the heavy cost of operating the jury system in the dis­
trict courts, which has resulted in large part from the recent in­
crease in the per diem of jurors, and discussed the need for an
efficient use of the time of jurors. The Conference discussed the
recommendation and approved distribution of the report on the
jury pool formula to all district courts.
   The Conference also authorized the resumption of the use of
the J.S. 11 report or. juror service and the preparation of appro­
priate statistics on juror utilization in the various district courts,
as recommended by the Committee.

                    ~ODEL JURY INSTRUCTIONS

   The Committee recommended that the Conference request each
chief judge of the United States courts of appeals to appoint a
circuit committee to undertake a study concerning the advisability
of formulating standard jury instructions for the district courts of
that circuit which may be of value in making the charges to the
jury on issues which commonly arise more precise and uniform.
The Conference was of the view, however, that the initial basic
work of preparing standard jury instructions might best be under­
taken by the Federal Judicial Center and accordingly voted to refer
the matter to the Center.

                         OTHER ~ATTERS

   The Committee reported that it is continuing its studies in the
areas of supplemental sources of juror names, automation, a re­
finement in the use of periodic reporting forms to be submitted
under 28 U.S.C. 1863(a), procedures on voir dire examinations, the
use of voir dire questionnaires, a proposal to reduce the number of
peremptory challenges allowable in criminal cases, juror relations
and accommodations, juror utilization and juror education.
  CO~~ITTEE        ON BANKRUPTCY           AD~INISTRATION

  Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman of the standing Committee
of the Conference on Bankruptcy Administration, presented the
report of the Committee.
          SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

   Judge Weinfeld reported that the Committee had considered the
recommendations contained in the survey report of the Director of
the Administrative Office, dated February 2, 1970, as well as the
recommendations of the circuit councils and the district courts
concerned, for increases in the salaries of three part-time referees,
the continuance of referee positions to become vacant by expira­
tion of term, and for changes in arrangements for referees.
   On the basis of the reports and recommendations, the Confer­
ence took the following action with respect to referee positions and
changes in salaries and arrangements. Unless otherwise noted, the
changes are effective April 1, 1970.

        holding court to remain as at present.

   Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference de­
ferred action on the filling of the £uH-time referee position at Miami
in the Southern District of Florida which will become vacant by ex­
piration of term on September 30, 1970. The Committee was
requested to report on this matter at the next session of the
Conference.
                      REFEREE-MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

   The Committee reported that it had considered proposed legis­
lation to amend the Bankruptcy Act and the Federal Magistrates
Act to permit full-time referees in bankruptcy to serve as part-time
United States magistrates. The Conference was informed that at
the present time there are 80 full-time referees who could devote
as much as 10 percent of their time to magistrate's duties. It was
the view of the Committee that it would be in the interest of good
administration to give referees the opportunity to assume these ad­
                                 24 

ditional duties. Upon recommendation of the Committee the Con~
ference approved in principle the draft bill which was submitted
by the Committee.
   The Conference also authorized the establishment of a liaison be·
tween the Committee on Bankruptcy Administration and the Com­
mittee to Implement the Federal Magistrates Act, so that there
may be a mutual understanding as to which referees are to be au­
thorized to do magistrates work, thus avoiding duplication of ap­
pointments, and so that there may be a coordination in respect to
the appointment of referees as part-time magistrates.

            FEES IN ASSET AND ARRANGEMENT CASES

   Judge Weinfeld informed the Conference that the estimated re­
ceipts into the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund for the fiscal
year 1971 would be approximately $11 million. Estimated expendi­
tures, however, are $15,750,000, leaving an excess of obligations
over payments of $4,750,000. In view of this large deficit the Com­
mittee recommended that the additional fees chargeable in asset
and nominal asset straight bankruptcy cases be increased by one­
half of 1 percent of net realization and that the additional fees in
Chapter XI cases be increased by 1 percent of debts paid or ex~
tended effective as to cases filed on or after July 1, 1970. This rec­
ommendation was approved by the Conference.
  The schedule of fees and charges in asset and arrangement cases,
as approved by the Conference pursuant to Section 40c(2) of the
Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 68(c) (2),nowreadsas follows:
      1. Fees to be Charged in Asset and N omina~ Asset Cases
          Three percent on net realization in straight bankruptcy
        cases filed from July 1, 1947, to December 31, 1953,
        inclusive.
          Two percent on net realization in straight bankruptcy
        cases filed from January 1, 1954, to December 31, 1956,
        inclusive.
          Cases filed on and after January 1, 1957, through
        June 30, 1969, two and one-half percent on the first $50,000
        of net realization and two percent on the balance of net
        realization with a minimum charge of $5.00.
                                 25 

          Cases filed on and after July 1, 1969, through June 30,
        1970, three percent on the first $50,000 of net realization
        and two and one-half percent 011 the balance of net reali­
        zation with a minimum charge of $5.00.
          Cases filed 011 and after July 1, 1970, three and one-half
        percent 011 the first $50,000 of net realization and three
        percent on the balance of net realization with a minimum
        charge of $5.00.
    II. 	Fees to be Charged in Arrangement Ca.ses filed Under
        Chapter XI
         One and one-half percent on total obligations paid or
       extended in Chapter XI cases filed from July 1, 1947, to
       December 31,1953, inclusive.
          One percent on total obligations paid or extended in
       Chapter XI cases filed from January 1, 1954, through De­
       cember 31, 1965.
         One percent on the first $100,000 of total obligations
       paid or extended in Chapter XI cases and one-half of one
       percent on the balance in all cases filed from January 1,
       1966, through June 30, 1969.
         Cases filed on and after July 1, 1969, through June 30,
       1970, two percent on the first $100,000 of total obligations
       paid or extended in Chapter XI cases and one-half of one
       percent on the balance.
         Cases filed on and after July 1, 1970, three percent on
       the first $100,000 of total obligations paid or extended in
       Chapter XI cases and one and one-half percent on the
       balance.
  The Conference was informed that these changes in rates will
increase payments into the Referees' Salary and Expense Fund by
an estimated $1 million annually.
  Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference au­
thorized the Director of the Administrative Office to prepare a
draft of an amendment to Section 40 of the Bankruptcy Act (11
U.S.C. 68), and related sections, to abolish the self-supporting
bankruptcy system in accordance with the policy adopted by the
Conference at its October 1969 session (Conf.Rept., p. 76).

                   VACANCIES IN REFEREE POSITIONS

  Judge Weinfeld informed the Conference that as vacancies have
occurred in referee positions in the district courts where there has
been a substantial decrease in new filings, the judges of the court
have been urged to defer new appointments so long as the remain­
ing referees are able to handle the bankruptcy business of the
district. At the present time the filling of seven referee positions                 -i

located in six different districts has been deferred on this basis. It
was the view of the Committee that a statement of approval of
this procedure would be desirable. Upon recommendation of the
Committee the Conference thereupon approved the following
statement of policy:
   The Conference approves the policy of deferring the filling of vacancies in
referee positions, particularly those occurring by resignation, retirement or
(leath, whenever it appears that the remaining referees of the district can han­
dle the business of ,the bankruptcy court with dispatch.

                    GUIDELINES FOR CHAPTER            XIII
   The Committee reported that it had been informed by the
Bankrupcty Division of the Administrative Office that several
Chapter XIII trustees are personally or financially interested in
"debt counselling" or "pro-rater" activities. At least one trustee
actively and openly solicits debt counselling business through ad­
vertisement in the classified section of the local telephone directory.
It is the general practice of Itpro-raters" to take their fees from
payments made by the debtor before any distribution is made to
creditors.
  It was the view of the Committee that such activity on the
part of Chapter XIII trustees represents a serious conflict of in­
terest and should be prohibited. Upon recommendation of the
Committee the Conference adopted the following resolution as an
additional guideline for the administration of Chapter XIII cases.
  Re8olvea, That it is the sense of the Conference that no Chapter XIII trustee
should perform the duties of, or have financial interest in, doebt counselling or
pro--rating. It any person who is related by affinity or consanguinity within the
degree of first cousin to the Obapter XIII trustee is engaged in debt counselling
or pro-rating in the integral commercial area, the trustee shall file an affidavit
with the bankruptcy court tbat be bas no financiftl interest, directly or in­
directly, in sucb enterprise.

                FEES OF RECEIVERS AND TRUSTEES

   The Committee reported that a number of requests have been
received for consideration of increases in the compensation of re­
ceivers and trustees fixed by Section 48 of the Bankruptcy Act
(11 U.s.C. 76). The rates of compensation have not been changed
since 1956 and some referees have reported increasing difficulty in
obtaining the services of competent trustees. The Committee has
directed the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office to
consider the problem and report to the Committee at its next
meeting.

  COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
            PROBATION SYSTEM

  Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman of the Committee
on the Administration of the Probation System, presented the re­
port of the Committee.
                     SENTENCING INSTITUTE

  The Conference at its October 1969 session (Conf. Rept., p. 78)
approved the holding of a circuit sentencing institute in the Ninth
Circuit during the Spring of 1970 with the understanding that the
agenda for the institute would be submitted at the next session of
the Conference. A proposed agenda for such an institute to be held
May 8-9, 1970 at Phoenix, Ariz. had previously been submitted
to the Committee. Upon the Committee's recommendation the
Conference approved the agenda and authorized the convening of
the institute in a,ccordance with the statute, 28 U.S.C. 334.

        RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY TREATMENT CENTERS

   S. 3261, 91st Congress, would amend Title 18 of the United
States Code to authorize the Attorney General to admit to resi­
dential community treatment centers persons who are placed on
probation, released on parole, or mandatorily released from federal
institutions. The bill is identical to H.R. 10511, 90th Congress,
approved by the Conference at its September 1967 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 82) and H.R. 2175, 91st Congress, approved by the Con­
ference in March 1969 (Conf. Rept., p. 27). Upon recommenda­
tion of the Committee the Conference approved the bill.
                                 28
              PROTECTION OF PROBATION OFFICERS

   The Committee submitted to the Conference a draft bill which
would amend Title 18 of the United States Code to provide for
the protection of United States probation officers. The bill would
amend 18 U.S.C. 1114 by making it a crime to kill a probation offi­
cer who is engaged in the performance of his official duties, or on
account of the performance of his official duties. Similar legislation
had previously been considered and approved by the Conference.
Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference approved
the proposal and instructed the Director of the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts to transmit the proposed legisla­
tion to the Congress.

              UNITED STATES CORRECTIONS SERVICE

   Judge Hoffman reported that H.R. 11823, 91st Congress, would
in part create a United States Corrections Service in the Depart­
ment of Justice, remove from court control the supervision of per­
sons on probation, and place that responsibility under the jurisdic­
tion of the Attorney GeneraL In this respect the bill is similar to
bills previously considered and disapproved by the Conference.
Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference voted to
reaffirm its opposition to placing the probation service under the
jurisdiction and control of the Department of Justice and voted to
disapprove H.R. 11823 to the extent that it differs from this policy.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference reaf­
firmed its approval of an amended draft of S. 916, 91st Congress,
which would make changes within the correctional organization of
the Department of Justice and would provide a strengthened cor­
rections council, but would not divide or dislocate the probation
service. (See ConL Repts., Mar. 1967, p. 37; Feb. 1968, p. 30; and
Mar. 1969, p. 27.)

            WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR PROBATIONERS

   Chief Judge Roy W. Harper suggested to the Conference that a
study be conducted to determine the feasibility of having the Con­
ference adopt a resolution recommending that a person placed on
probation be required to work, unless the court otherwise orders.
It was the sense of the Conference that such a study should be un­
dertaken by the Committee.
                                 29 

   COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  Chief Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman of the Committee on
Intercircuit Assignments, presented a report on the activities of the
Committee from August 11, 1969 to February 1, 1970. During this
period the Committee recommended 29 intercircuit assignments to
be undertaken by 26 judges. Of this number, 3 are circuit judges
in regular active service, 3 are senior circuit judges, 7 are district
judges in regular active service, and 10 are senior district judges.
There were two assignments of active judges of the Customs Court
and one assignment of a senior judge of the Court of Claims. There
were 7 assignments made to the United States courts of appeals;
7 assignments to the United States Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals; and 15 assignments to the United States district courts.

COMMITTEE ON TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE

   Chief Judge Joe E. Estes, Chairman of the Committee on Trial
Practice and Technique, submitted to the Conference sample jury
instructions for use in certain civil tax cases and sample jury in­
structions for use in certain civil antitrust cases. These instruc­
tions are the product of the work of the Committee during the last
18 months. Upon recommendation of the Committee the Con­
ference authorized the circulation of these sample instructions to
all district judges as an aid in the preparation of jury charges.
        HABEAS CORPUS PETITIONS BY STATE PRISONERS

   The Committee had reported that it had considered various
problems relating to the calendaring and disposition of habeas
corpus cases brought on behalf of persons in custody pursuant to a
judgment of a state court. It was the view of the Committee that the
time limitations set out in 28 U.S.C. 2243, as applied to habeas
corpus petitions by persons in custody pursuant to the judgment
of a State court, are unrealistic.
   It was brought to the attention of the Conference that the Ad­
visory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
is now considering the formulation of special rules governing ha­
beas corpus petitions. After full discussion the Conference directed
that the matter be referred to the standing Committee on Rules
of Practice and Procedure with the request that expeditious ac­
tion on this matter be taken by the Committee.

     COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL 

               MAGISTRATES ACT 


  Judge William E. Doyle, Chairman of the Committee to Imple­
ment the Federal Magistrates Act, presented the report of the
Committee.
                      MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

   Judge Doyle reported that the Committee had met and con­
sidered the recommendations contained in the survey report of
the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States
 Courts, dated October 20, 1969, as well as the recommendations of
the circuit councils and district courts concerned, for authoriza­
tion to appoint full-time and part-time magistrates in the various
district courts pursuant to the Federal Magistrates Act, Public
Law 90-578, 28 U.S.C. 631, et seq. The Committee recommended
that the full-time and part-time magistrate positions, recom­
mended in the Committee's report, be approved and that the dis­
trict courts be authorized to make appointments to these positions
effective July 1, 1970, or as soon thereafter as appropriated funds
are available. The Committee's recommendations include 61 full­
time magistrate positions; 449 part-time magistrate positions; 6
combination positions of magistrate-part time referee in bank­
ruptcy; and 2 combination positions of magistrate-clerk of court.
These 518 magistrates will replace approximately 700 U ni ted States
commissioner positions and 15 national park commissioner posi­
tions authorized prior to the effective date of the Magistrates Act.
   After full consideration, the Conference approved the recom­
mendations of the Committee with one adjustment in the salary
of a part-time magistrate position in Puerto Rico and with the
further understanding that resurveys would be made at six-month
intervals in all courts where the recommendation of the Commit­
tee varied from that of the judicial councils of the circuits. The
number, locations and salaries of the magistrate positions, as ap­
proved by the Conference, are set out in the Appendix.

                    SALARIES OF MAGISTRATES

  The Committee recommended the approval of a bill, H.R. 13316,
91st Congress, which would amend the Federal Magistrates Act
to increase the maximum salaries payable to full-time and part­
                                 31 

time magistrates to coincide with the maximum salaries payable
to referees in bankruptcy. During the discussion in the Confer­
ence it was pointed out, however, that the salary range for referees
in bankruptcy had been set by.the Presidential Salary Commis­
sion in its report in 1968. The Conference felt that the Commis­
sion, when it next meets in 1972, should be given jurisdiction to fix
the maximum salaries payable to United States magistrates. The
Conference thereupon voted to take no action with respect to the
legislation, thus leaving the matter for consideration by the Pres­
idential Salary Commission.

                  ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

  Upon recommendation of the Committee the Conference ap­
proved an amendment to the administrative regulations relating to
the conduct of the pilot magistrates program, previously approved
by the Conference (Conf. Rept., Mar. 1969, p. 33), which would
permit part-time magistrates to make collect telephone calls under
certain circumstances.
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of the report
of the Committee to all circuit and district judges together with a
memorandum setting forth Conference action with respect to Com­
mittee recommendations.

      COMMITI'EE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                  PROCEDURE 


   Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing Committee of
the Conference on Rules of Practice and Procedure, reported that
the amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relat­
ing to depositions and discovery, which were approved by the Con­
ference at its last session (Conf. Rept., p. 71), were transmitted to
the Supreme Court on November 3, 1969 and are under considera­
tion by the Court.
                         CRIMINAL RULES

  Judge Maris advised the Conference that the standing Commit­
tee had authorized the publication and circulation to the bench
and bar of proposed amendments to various rules of the
                                 32 

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure together with five new pro­
posed rules. The Committee has requested that comments and
suggestions with respect to these proposed rules be in the hands of
the Committee no later than April 1, 1971, so that proposals with
respect to the rules may be reported to the Conference at its ses­
sion in the Fall of 1971.
   The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is also giving con­
sideration to the question as to how early in the process of criminal
investigation and arrest of a suspected criminal the rule-making
authority of the Supreme Court comes into play. In this regard the
Committee is reviewing the "Model Rules of Court on Police Ac­
tion from Arrest to Arraignment" which has been published by the
Council of Judges of the National Council on Crime and Delin­
quency. The Advisory Committee is also undertaking a study of
proposed rules of procedure in habeas corpus cases and motions to
vacate sentence filed in the district courts under 28 U.S.C. 2255.

                       RULES OF EVIDENCE

   The Conference was informed that comments and suggestions
from the bench and bar with respect to the draft of Uniform Rules
of Evidence for the Federal Courts, circulated by the standing
Committee in March 1969, are being received. The final date for
their receipt is April 1, 1970. The Committee hopes to be able to
report a definitive draft of uniform rules of evidence to the Con­
ference at its Fall session in 1970.
                        ApPELLATE RULES

  The Conference was also advised that the amendments to the
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, approved by the Confer­
encein October 1969 (Conf. Report., p. 70), were transmitted to the
Supreme Court on November 9, 1969 and are under consideration
by the Court.
                        ADMIRALTY RULES

  Judge Maris advised the Conference that the Advisory Commit­
tee on Admiralty Rules is continuing its study of the operation of
the unified civil rules and the supplemental rules as they apply to
maritime cases. Comments from the admiralty bar in reply to the
Advisory Committee's letter are being given consideration.

COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 

                   ACT 

  Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman of the Committee to Imple­
ment the Criminal Justice Act, presented the report of the
Committee.
                 ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   Judge Hastings presented to the Conference a cumulative re­
port, prepared in the Administrative Office, on appointments and
payments from the effective date of the Criminal Justice Act, Au­
gust 20, 1965, through December 31, 1969. The report showed
payments of $12,762,665 under the Act since its inception. During
the first half of the fiscal year 1970 (July I-December 31, 1969)
disbursements in the settlement of claims for services rendered on
behalf of criminal defendants and appellants totaled $2,549,040.
Based on the projected volume of appointments and the average
cost per case during the ourrent fiscal year, a request for a
supplemental appropriation in the amount of $1,150,000 has been
submitted.
   Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference au~
thorized the immediate release of this report and directed that
copies be sent to all Federal judges and to the chief judges of the
local courts in the District of Columbia.
                           GUIDELINES

   The Committee had previously reported that consideration of
the guidelines in implementation of the Criminal Justice Act had
been postponed because of the likelihood of an early amendment of
the Act and because full implementation of the Federal Magistrates
Act, which may occur in 1970, makes premature any issuance of
guidelines. On further reflection, however, the Committee con­
cluded that since there is no present indication as to when or
whether the Act will be amended, it would be helpful to have the
views of those who are currently using the provisions of the Act on
the guidelines, so that when they are subsequently revised, the
Committee may have the benefit of the views and comments of
judges, clerks of court and others concerned with the implementa­
tion of the Act. The Conference, upon recommendation of the
Committee, authorized the distribution to all Federal judges, clerks
                                      34 

of court, United States commissioners and United States magis­
trates, and to all judges and clerks of the courts in the District of
Columbia, a cop~ of the guidelines for the administration of the
Criminal Justice Act submitted b~ the Committee, and further di­
rected the Administrative Office to solicit comments and criticisms
of the guidelines for the future guidance of the Committee.
            IMPACT OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES ACT

   Judge Hastings reported that in connection with the pilot pro­
gram undertaken during the past ~ear in implementation of the
Federal Magistrates Act, the Committee had been giving con­
sideration to necessar~ changes in the plans originall~ drafted
under the Criminal Justice Act to meet the requirements of the
new Act. In addition) the Committee had received a communica­
tion from the Chairman of the Committee to Implement the Fed­
eral Magistrates Act requesting the advice of the Committee in
two particulars:
  (1) 	The desirability of compensating counsel appointed to represent defend­
       ants in petty offense case, or in the alternative, the appropriate method
       to establish a system of uncompensated appointments in petty offense
       cases; and
  (2) 	The need to amend existing district oourt plans, adopted under CJA, to
       (a) 	authorize appointments by magistrates rather than United States
            commissioners--a technical amendment, and
       (b) 	permit magistrates to appoint counsel for the trial of cases before
            them in acoordance with their new jurisdiction over certain
           misdemeanors.
   In regard to the appointment of counsel in pett~ offense cases,
it was the view of the Committee that inasmuch as the Criminal
Justice Act expressl~ excludes from its coverage petty offense
cases, the question of appointment of uncompensated counsel in
such cases is a matter for the determination of the district courts
themselves. Accordingly, the Committee made no recommendation
on this matter.
   In regard to the need for amending the plans adopted under the
Criminal Justice Act the Committee submitted the following rec­
ommendations which were approved by the Conference:
                                         35 

Recommendations for Revision of Criminal Justice Act Plans as
  May Be Required by the Enactment of the Federal Magistrates
  Act:
  It is recommended that each district court in implementing the
Federal Magistrates Act review the plan adopted pursuant to the
Criminal Justice Act and consider the following:
 1. 	 Wherever "United Sta:tes commissioner" is used in a plan, the name should
     be changed to United States magistrate.
 2. 	The plan adopted in implementation of the Criminal Justice Act should
      be examined with a view to making any c'hanges which may be required
      in the light of the duties which the district court will assign to the United
     Stiates magistrates in the district as a result of the delegation of duties which
      the court may make to a magistrate under the terms of the Federal Magis­
     trates Act.
 3. 	With special reference to the trial of minor offenses by United States
     magistrates and in order to insure that a defendant will have full repre­
     sentation at every stage of the proceeding against him, each plan for a
     district in which a magistrate will try minor offenses should contain a
     section captioned "Trial by United States Magistrates." It is snggested that
     this section should contain the following:
     (a) 	Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, in any case in
           which a defendant charged with a minor offense, other than a petty
          offense, waives a trial in the district court and appears without counsel
           for trial before the magistrate, he shall again advise the defendant that
           he has a right to be represented by counsel and that counsel will be
          appointed to represent him if the defendant is financially unable to
          obtain counsel. Unless the defendant expressly waives the appointment
          of counsel, the magistrate, if satisfied after making appropriate inquiry
           that the defendant is financially unable to obtain counsel, shall appoint
          counsel to repreeent him at the trial in accordance with the general
          procedure for appointing counsel set out in this plan. ASSignment and
          compensation of counsel in petty offense cases remains a matter of
          court policy j the CJA excludes petty offense cases from its coverage.
     (b) 	Counsel so appointed shall represent the defendant in 'all trial proceed­
          ings before the magistrate and throngh appeal to the district coua and
          thereafter unless or until he is relieved by the magistrate or the court.
     (0) 	 The magistrate may, in the ill'terest of justice, substitute one appOinted
          counsel for another 'at any stage of the trial proceedings.
   . (d) If at any time after the appointment of' counsel, the magistrate finds
          that the defendant is financially able to obtain counselor make partial
          payment for the representation, he may terminate the appointment of
          counselor recommend to the court that any funds available to defend­
          ant be ordered paid as provided in 18 U.S.C. 3006A(f).
     (6) 	If at any stage of the trial proceedings, the magistrate finds that the
          defendant is financially unable to pay counsel whom he had retained or
          to obtain other counsel, the magistrate may appoint counsel in accord­
          ance with the general procedure set forth in this plan.
                                        36 

    (1) 	 A claim for compenmtion and reimbursement of expenses of counsel
            appointed in a case tried before the magistrate shall be made to the
            magistrate on the prescribed CJA form. The magistrate shall examine
            each claim, and make a recommendation to the court as to the amount
            which the court shoUld fix in accordance with the statute.
       (u) 	 Counsel for a defendant charged with a minor offense, other than a
            petty offense, to be tried before the magistrate may, in an ex parte
           application to the United States magistrate, request investigative, ex­
            pert or other services if the defendant is financially unable to obtain
            them. Upon finding, after appropriate inquiry in an ex parte proceed­
            ing, that the services are necessary and that the defendant is finan­
            cially unable to obtain them, the magistrate shall recommend to the
           court that counsel be authorized to obtain such services on behalf of
            the defendant. The magistrate may, in the interests of justice, and upon
            a finding that timely procurement of necessary services could not await
            prior authorization, recommend that the court ratify such services after
            they have been obtained. A claim for any such services shall be reviewed
            by the magistrate who shall make a recommendation to the judge with
           respect to the amount to be allowed by the court in accordance with
           the statute.
 4. 	 It is further recommended that, prior to the appointment of United States
      magistrates, each court review its CJA plan in order to correct any Il.lloma·
      lies in the provisions which may result therefrom, such as the following:
      (a) 	 Some plans refer to the fact that hearings before commissioners are
            not recorded. These should be changed in the light of 18 U.S.C. 3060
           which now provides for recording of preliminary examinations before
           magistrates and 18 U.S.C. 3401 which provides for the recording of trials
           of minor offenses before United States magistrates.
      (0) 	 Provisions relating to the creation, transferring and custody of rec­
            ords should be reviewed to be certain that the magistrate should retain
           custody of papers in minor offense cases, other than petty offense
           cases, to be tried before him until the completion of trial proceedings.
 5. 	 Courts desiring to vest full-time United States magistrates with the over­
     all duty of appointing counsel and supervising the maintenance of lists or
     panels of attorneys available for appointment under CJA should consider
      adding specific provisions to their plans.
