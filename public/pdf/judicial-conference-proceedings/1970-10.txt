Jr., former Director, attended the Conference briefly and was pre~
sen ted with a framed copy of the Conference resolution concerning

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   Mr. Rowland F. Kirks, who assumed the post of Director of the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts on July 1, 1970,
reported to the Conference on the state of the business of the fed­
eral courts.
   Mr. Kirks highlighted to the Conference certain factors deserv­
ing special mention. For example, case filings in the courts of ap­
peals increased 14 percent in fiscal year 1970 over the preceding
fiscal year. At the same time criminal and civil actions begun-in
the district courts increased 13 percent. Bankruptcy filings, after
showing a decline for two years, rose 5.1 percent in 1970 over 1969.
                                       55
        Mr. Kirks expressed particular concern over the mounting peti­
     tions to review orders of referees in the district courts and stressed
     that 367 such petitions were pending in the district courts on
    March 31,1970. Of this number 63 have been pending from one to
    five and one-half years, with the result that often substantial sums
    of money are held up in depository banks for ultimate distribution
    to creditors. He suggested Conference study of this problem, and
    it was agreed that the Administrative Office should advise the cir­
    cuit councils on a periodic basis of such delinquencies and request
    that the councils look into each case.
        The C-onference granted the Director the authority to release the
    preliminary edition of his report in mimeographed form and to
    revise and supplement the final printed edition.
                        EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
      Chief Judge Lumbard, Chairman, reported that his committee
    had approved and authorized implementation of a report of an ad
    hoc committee, chaired by Judge Edward A. Tamm, relating to
    security problems in the federal courts. Judge Tamm explained his
    Committee's study and findings to the Conference. The Conference
    approved the action of the Executive Committee.

       COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                   CRIMINAL LAW
      Judge George C. Edwards, Jr., Chairman, presented the report
    of the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.
                             EXPEDITING TRIALS

       Judge Edwards presented for consideration S. 3936, a bill to give
    effect to the speedy trial provision of the Sixth Amendment, and
    noted that the bill was similar to H.R. 14822, 91st Congress, on
    which the Conference had expressed its views at the March 1970
    session (Conf. Rept., p. 17). The Conference agreed to recommend
    that the Congress take no action at this time on Title I, which
    would require trial within a period of 60 days for most cases, sub­
    ject to certain specified exceptions. Although endorsing the princi­
    ple of speedy trial, the Conference felt the time limit was unrealistic

         413-441--71----2
                                   56
in light of insufficient staff personnel in the courts, the difficulty of
obtaining witnesses in metropolitan areas and the pressure of
priority trials mandated by the Congress or by the Federal Rules.
The Conference also noted several steps which federal courts are
taking to expedite the trial of federal criminal cases.
   The Conference voted further to recommend to the Advisory
Committee on Criminal Rules the adoption of a rule to provide
that whenever the United States Attorney certifies that he has
reason to believe tha.t the pretrial liberty of a particular defendant
imposes a serious danger to the safety of persons, including the
defendant himself, the district court shall provide for the prompt
disposition of such a case. The Conference also voted to suggest
that funds be appropriated immediately and that existing funds
be utilized for an immediate study of each federal court in order to
determine its needs as to judicial and supporting personnel in court­
room and related facilities.
   The Conference voted disapproval of Title II of proposed legis­
lation which would impose an additional penalty of up to three
years, consecutively with the penalty imposed for an offense com­
mitted while the offender was on release under the Bail Reform
Act. The Conference noted that its Committee was of the view
that the policy contained in Title II can be accomplished by the            (j
courts within the framework of the present sentencing structure.
   The Conference approved Title III as to pretrial service agen­
cies, noting that it was substantially identical to a feature of H.R.
14822 approved at the March 1970 session of the Conference (Conf.
Rept., p. 17).
                       REVIEW OF SENTENCES

   In considering further H.R. 6188, the Conference agreed that,
because of the heavy additional burden which would be placed
on the already overtaxed courts of appeals, it could not approve
the principle of appellate review of sentences. The Conference be­
lieves, however, that a study should be made to determine some
type of review of sentencing and agreed that this was a procedural
matter which should be studied by the Advisory Committee on
Criminal Rules.

        ApPEAL BY A DEFENDANT FOLLOWING ENTRY OF A GUILTY PLEA
(
           Judge Edwards reported that pursuant to the action of the Con­
        ference at the March 1970 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 16), his Com­
        mittee has restudied the matter and agreed to recommend a draft
        bill to provide that a defendant who has pleaded guilty to an offense
        may appeal from the denial of his motion made before entry of
        such plea of guilty for the return of seized property or for the
        suppression of evidence, with the proviso, however, that a judge
        denying the motion must certify that the appeal raises a substan­
        tial question. The appeal must be taken within ten days of the
        entry of judgment. The Conference agreed to recommend the Com­
        mittee's draft bill to the Congress.

                                 HABEAS CORPUS

           In the opinion of the Supreme Court in Nelson v. George, de­
        cided June 29, 1970, a suggestion was made for amendment to 18
        U.S.C. 2241. The Conference agreed with a recommendation of the
        Committee that legislation be recommended to the Congress to
        cover the situation where an individual serving a sentence in one
        state is subject to a detainer filed by another state. The proposed
    (   legislation would enable him to challenge the conviction which has
        given rise to the detainer.

                   PREPABATION OF TRANSCRIPTS ON ApPEAL

           In order to expedite the preparation of transcripts in criminal
        cases in which appeals are filed, the Conference approved a sugges­
        tion of the Committee to suggest to the Advisory Committee on
        the Rules of Practice and Procedure two additions to Rules 9(b)
        and lOeb). The Conference further agreed with the Committee
        recommendation to authorize the Federal Judicial Center to con­
        duct and expedite a study with respect to recording trials through
        video tape or other similar mechanical processes.

                               OTHER LEGISLATION

          The Conference voted to take no position on H.R. 13229 relat­
        ing to acts committed on board trains which are dangerous to per­
                                 58
sons. The Conference was of the view that this involves a policy
matter which is for the decision of the Congress.
   The C{)nference voted disapproval in its present form of
RR. 15167 providing amnesty for certain first offenders.
   The Conference voted to take no position on S. 978 which would
create a commission to study the effect of certain court decisions
inasmuch as this involves a matter of Congressional policy.
   The Conference expressed no objection to H.R. 14027 providing
certain legal remedies to protect the rights of persons within the
jurisdiction of certain Indian tribes provided the requirement for
a three-judge court and provision for direct appeal to the Supreme
Court are eliminated from the bill.
   The Conference voted its disapproval of H.R. 7972 making it a
crime to move or travel in interstate or foreign commerce to avoid
compliance with certain support orders.
COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
  Judge Irving R. Kaufman, Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System.
                      PREJUDICIAL PUBLICITY

   At its September 1968 meeting the Conference approved the
                                                                        ()
adoption of a report prepared by the Committee relating to the
problem of prejudicial publicity. Judge Kaufman reported that his
Committee has restudied those guidelines in the light of the
potential prejudice arising from the spate of pretrial publicity
surrounding several controversial prosecutions. He stated that his
Committee also noted the issuance by the American Bar Associa­
tion of revised free press fair trial standards. The Committee
accordingly recommended to the Conference and the Conference
approved two principal changes in the previously approved free
press fair trial guidelines. The first concerns the release of infor­
mation by attorneys during the investigative stage of a criminal
proceeding. The present guidelines are limited to attorneys par­
ticipating in an investigation. This phrase is now changed to read
"associated with" an investigation.
   The second principal amendment to the guidelines is the addition
of a provision to govern disclosures by attorneys before and dur­
ing the trials of civil cases. This provision corresponds closely to
                                      59 


    the rule of the American Bar Association Code of Professional
    Responsibility.
(     The Conference approved the distribution of the Supplemental
    Report on Free Press Fair Trial.
                          VOIR DIRE PROCEDURES

       Judge Kaufman stated that a subcommittee of his Committee
    had completed a study of voir dire examination procedures based
    on a poll of all federal judges and a parallel survey of United States
    Attorneys conducted by the Department of Justice. Based on this
    study, the Committee recommends, as the preferred procedure,
    examination by the court, supplemented by questions directed to
    the court by counsel. The Committee also called attention to the
    fact that trial judges in their broad discretion over voir dire pro­
    ceedings may occasionally find it appropriate to examine jurors
    individually out of the presence of other jurors when questions rele­
    vant to the case may call for personal or potentially embarrassing
    responses. The Conference authorized the Administrative Office
    to distribute this portion of the Committee's report to the district
    courts.
                  SUPPLEMENTAL QUESTIONNAIRE FORMS
(      Based on a subcommittee study, the Committee recommended
    and the Conference approved a supplemental questionnaire form
    which would eliminate a question relating to employment by an
    insurance company but would include a question as to whether the
    prospective juror is an employee of the United States government
    and a question as to the one-way mileage from home to the court
    house. The Conference approved the recommendation that the
    Administrative Office distribute the supplemental form to the dis­
    trict courts, on request,· and to advise the clerks of court of the
    availability of the supplemental form, if desired.
                             JURY SUMMONS

       The Committee noted a variation in the procedures by which the
    district courts summon grand jurors. Some summon them in a
    separate venire from petit jurors while others issue a general jury
    summons and select grand and petit jurors from the same jury pool.
    'rhe only form now available adopts the latter position. To meet
                                 60 

the needs of courts which summon grand jurors separately, the
Conference approved the printing and stocking by the Administra­
tive Office of two additional jury summonses, identical to the gen­
eral summons now stocked, except that one is to be labeled for petit
jury service and the other for grand jury service.
      PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER THE JURY SELECTION ACT

   At its October 1969 meeting, .the Conference approved a form
for the periodic reports on jury selection required by 28 U.S.C.
1863(a) to be filed beginning in September 1971 (Conf. Rept., p.
65). The Conference approved a revised Part 3 of the periodic re­
porting form, incorporating a new occupational listing compiled
in conjunction with the Bureau of the Census. It was agreed that
this form can be submitted by the clerk of the court.
                        J UROR UTILIZATION

  Judge Kaufman reported that his Committee, in cooperation
with the Federal Judicial Center, is sponsoring an extensive study
of juror utilization in the Southern District of New York and other
appropriate districts in the hope that this study will produce con­
crete and practical guidelines for jury management which will be
valuable to all district courts.                                    (       ,
                  JURY UTILIZATION SPECIALIST

   Judge Kaufman reported to the Conference that despite the in­
crease in jury costs to more than $14,000,000 in fiscal year 1970,
the Administrative Office does not employ a fuJI-time staff mem­
ber whose responsibility it is to supervise jury administration on a
day-to-day basis to collect and evaluate juror utilization statistics
and to assist the district courts in implementing new techniques
proposed by the Administrative Office and the Administrative Con­
ference. Judge Kaufman stated that his Committee regards the
lack of such a specialist as seriously burdening both the Adminis­
trative Office and the district courts in their efforts to modernize
juror management. The Conference approved the Committee rec­
omendation expressing support for the addition of at least one full­
time specialist in jury selection and management to the staff of the
Administrative Office.

      COMMITTEE ON BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
      Judge Edward Weinfeld, Chairman of the Committee on Bank­
    ruptcy Administration, presented the Committee report to the
    Conference.
                  SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

      Judge Weinfeld reported that his Committee had considered the
    recommendations contained in the survey report of the Director of
    the Administrative Office, dated June 17, 1970, as well as the recom­
    mendations of the circuit councils and district judges concerned
    for salary increases for one full-time and two part-time referees,
    for the continuance of referee positions to become vacant by ex­
    piration of term and for increasing the service of one part-time
    referee to full-time status. On the basis of the reports and recom­
    mendations, the Conference took the following action with respect
    to referee positions and changes in salaries and arrangements.
    Unless otherwise noted, the changes are effective November 1,
    1970 or upon the availability of appropriated funds.

                            LEGISLATION

    Pursuant to Conference authorization at its March 1970 session
 (Conf. Rept., p. 25), the Committee presented and the Conference
approved for transmittal to the Congress a draft bill which would
abolish the self-supporting bankruptcy system and eliminate the
present criteria for fixing salaries of full-time referees. The bill
would provide that fees and charges collected by the clerk of the
district court in bankruptcy proceedings be paid into the general
fund of the treasury and that salaries and expenses of referees will
be paid from the general fund of the treasury.
    The Conference voted disapproval of S. 3625, a bill which would
amend Section 614 of the Bankruptcy Act to extend the protection
of the court to the spouses of debtors filing wage-earner plans even
though they are not parties to the proceedings or subject to the
jurisdiction of the court. The Conference noted that the same
                                                                            I
considerations would not apply to an amendment which would
permit joint petitions of husband and wife to be filed under a single       'I
filing fee.
   The Conference approved a proposed bill to amend Section 48
of the Bankruptcy Act to increase the maximum compensation
allowable to receivers and trustees. The Conference authorized
the Director of the Administrative Office to transmit this proposal
to the 92nd Congress.
                  AUDIT OF STATISTICAL REPORTS

   The Conference noted that the audit of statistical reports of
closed bankruptcy cases since the last meeting of the Bankruptcy
Committee disclosed four instances of underpayment to the Ref­
erees' Salary and Expense Fund, twenty overpayments to the Fund,
and 32 overpayments of commissions to receivers and trustees.
Other matters relating to apparent errors in the reports taken up
with the referees totalled 133.
                      CHAPTER    XIII CASES
  The Conference noted that the Bankruptcy Division reported
that in the first nine months of fiscal year 1970 a total of 22,645
Chapter XIII cases was filed. This is 1,212 more than during the
comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The Division reported


                                                                        (
                                  65 

that compliance with Chapter XIII guidelines previously promul­
gated by the Judicial Conference was generally satisfactory. The
Conference noted that as a result of the new guideline approved at
the March 1970 session (Conf. Rept., p. 26)· the relatively few
Chapter XIII trustees who were also engaged in debt counseling
have resigned or have ceased to act as debt counselors for profit.

                      SEMINARS FOR REFEREES·

  Judge Weinfeld reported four regional seminars as follows: In­
dianapolis-September 1970, New York City-November 1970,
San Francisco-November 1970, and New Orleans-January 1971.
The pa.rticipants in these seminars range from 40-46 referees each.
During the past few months representatives of the Fraud Section
of the Criminial Division of the Department of Justice have also
participated in these seminars and have contributed to a better un­
derstanding of the importance of prompt and complete reporting of
suspected violations.
   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
              PROBATION SYSTEM
  Judge Walter E. Hoffman, Chairman of the Committee, pre­
sented the report of the Committee.
                      SENTENCING INSTITUTE

   The Conference approved the agenda for the joint sentencing in­
stitute of the Sixth and Seventh Judicial Circuits to be held at Dear­
born, Michigan, on April 21-23, 1971. In approving the agenda, the
Conference also approved the time, place and participants as re­
quired by statute.
           TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION OF PROBATIONERS

   At the October 1969 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 78) Judge Hoffman
advised that the Committee had under consideration the need for
establishing uniform policy for jurisdictional transfer of proba­
tioners, which is authorized by 18 U.S.C. 3653. The Committee has
meantime solicited the views of the chief judges of the district
courts concerning this problem and, as a result of its study, the
Committee recommended to the Conference and the Conference
                                        66 

adopted the following policy statement for the guidance of the
district courts:
   The Oonference recommends that in all instances where the supervision of                 (
a probationer is transferred from one district to another, jurisdiction be trans­
ferred simultaneously.
   Further, the Conference recommends that in those instances where supervision
of a probationer has been transferred without concurrent transfer of jurisdic'
tion and the probationer is considered to be in violation of his probation, juris­
diction be transferred for the purpose of conducting the probation violation
hearing.
  Finally, the Conference recommends that when a probationer is considered to
be in violation of his probation and is found in a district which holds neither
supervIsion nor jurisdiction of his case, jurisdiction be transferred to the district
in which he is found fOl' the purpose of conducting the probation violation
bearing.
  The Conference recognizes that the decision to transfer jurisdiction rests
with tbe district courts and in unusual instances there may exist compelling
reasons why jurisdiction should not transfer and why a court would desire to
retain jurisdiction, or why a cour.t would want to refrain from accepting juris­
diction. However, it is the sense of tbe Conference tbat transfer of jurisdiction
will enhance the effectiveness of the probation officers in the performance of
their duties and instu'e that a person held for probation violation be taken before
the court "as speedily as possible" (18 U.S.C. 3658).

               WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR PROBATIONERS

  As a result of a suggestion made by Chief Judge Harper at the
March 1970 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 28), Judge
Hoffman stated that the Committee has been considering a further
resolution recommending that a person placed on probation be re­
quired to work. He stated that the Committee has instructed the
Division of Probation to conduct a survey to determine, if possible,
how many employable probationers are unemployed. At Judge
Harper's further suggestion, Judge Hoffman stated that his Com­
mittee would look into the possibility of having probation officers
instructed to help obtain employment for probationers.
    COMMITTEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  Chief Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman of the Committee on
Intercircuit Assignments, presented a report on the Committee's
activities from February 1, 1970 to September 15, 1970. During
this period the Committee recommended 52 assignments to be
undertaken by 42 judges. Of this number, seven are circuit judges in
active st.atus, four are senior circuit judges, 19 are district judges in
active status and six are senior district judges.
                                                                                        (
                                       67 

        Three assignments were carried out by two active judges of
     the Court of Claims, one by an active judge of the Customs Court
     and another by an active judge of the Court of Customs and Patent
    Appeals. Two senior judges of the Court of Claims each carried out
     a.n assignment and two retired Supreme Court justices participated
    in six assignments.
        Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference ap­
    proved an amendment to the form for the assignment of a visiting
    judge so as to provide not only for additional time as may be re­
    quired to complete unfinished business as it now does but also
    to provide for such necessary time in advance of trial as may be
    necessary for the preparation of the trial of the case.
        The Conference also approved a Committee recommendation
    that upon an intercircuit assignment of a district judge, the visit­
    ing court should prepare a list of cases which are ready for trial and
    which are to be transferred to the visiting judge for trial upon his
    arrival. Such list is to contain at least 30 civil and at least 15 crimi­
    nal cases or a combination of the two. The cases shall be set for
    trial at the times directed by the visiting judge. This recommenda­
    tion does not apply, of course, when the visiting judge is assigned
    for the purpose of a specific case.
(        COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL
                  MAGISTRATES ACT
      Judge William E. Doyle, Chairman of the Committee to Imple­
    ment the Federal Magistrates Act, presented the report of the
    Committee.
                           MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

       Judge Doyle informed the Conference that the Committee had
    met and considered the recommendations contained in the resurvey
    reports of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
    States Courts, as well as the recommendations of the circuit coun­
    cils and the district courts concerned, with respect to courts where
    resurveys had been requested by the Conference at the March 1970
    session (Conf. Rept., p. 30).
       The Conference considered the recommendations of the Com­
    mittee fot changes in full-time and part-time magistrate positions,
    as well as the recommendations of the circuit councils and the dis­
    trict courts, and approved the following changes in the numbers,
                                                          68
locations, and salaries of magistrates. The Conference further au­
thorized the district courf.c3 to make appointments in accordance
with these changes as soon as they are notified by the Director of                                                             (
the Administrative Office that appropriated funds for this purpose
are available.

                  ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

  The Committee submitted to the Conference a revision of the
administrative regulations previously adopted by the Director of
the Administrative Office and approved by the Conference for use
in the pilot districts (Conf. Rept., Mar. 1969, p. 33). The revised
regulations are substantially the same as those previously approved.
Upon recommendation of the Committee the regulations were
approved by the Conference.
                     SALARIES OF MAGISTRATES

   At its previous session in March 1970 (Conf. Rept., p. 30) the
Conference voted to take no further action with respect to legisla­
tion to increase the statutory limitation on salaries payable to
United States magistrates on the basis that salaries would be
reviewed by the Presidential Salary Commission in 1972. The Com­
mittee pointed out, however, that the Salary Commission would
not have jurisdiction to make recommendations regarding salaries
of magistrates. The Committee therefore rooommended (1) that
the Conference reaffirm the principle that the maximum salary
payable to a United States magistrate should be on a parity with
the maximum salary paid to a referee in bankruptcy and (2) that
the Federal Magistrates Act accordingly be amended to increase
the maximum salaries to $30,000 per annum for full-time magis­
trates and $18,000 per annum for part-time magistrates.
   The Conference discussed the recommendations of the Com­
mittee and voted to postpone action on the proposal until the
next session of the Conference.

                    FORFEITURE OF CoLLATERAL

   The Committee reported that the forfeiture of collateral pro­
cedure in use in three pilot districts had been operating satis­
factorily. It has reduced paperwork, safeguarded the handling of
funds and relieved magistrates of clerical functions. It has further
obviated the necessity of bringing petty offenders before a judicial
officer, thus freeing magistrates to perform other substantial duties
for the courts. On the basis of this favorable experience the Com­
mittee has rooommended that each district court consider adopt­
ing this system.
                                       72
  On recommendation of the Committee the Conference approved
the form of the violation notice developed in the pilot program for
use in all district courts adopting the forfeiture of collateral                        (
procedure.
                 VACANCIES IN MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

  The Committee recommended that the procedure for filling a
vacancy in a magistrate position, by reason of death or resignation,
be the same as the procedure followed in filling such a vacancy in
the position of referee in bankruptcy. The Conference approved
the recommendation and adopted the following policy:
  A vacancy in the office of United States magistrate may be filled without any
change in the salary or arrangement upon the recommendation of the Director,
the district court. and the circuit council that the office be so continued. If a
change in the salary or arrangement is recommended by the Director, the district
court, or the circuit council, a vacancy shall not be filled until the Conference
has acted thereon.

COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
  Judge Albert B. Maris, Chairman of the standing Committee
on the Rules of Practice and Procedure, presented the Committee's
report.
                            RULES OF EVIDENCE                                       (       )
   Judge Maris presented to the Conference the Committee's
definitive draft of proposed rules of evidence for United States
courts. In so doing, he advised the Conference that the rules were
the culmination of a project begun in 1958 when the Judicial
O:mference first referred a proposal for uniform rules of evidence
to the standing Committee. In 1961 the Conference authorized
the creation of an advisory committee to study and report on the
advisability and feasibility of the proposal. Based on a faNorable
recommendation of this advisory committee, the Chief Justice in
1965 appointed an Advisory Committee which has produced the
present proposed rules. Judge Maris pointed out that these rules
were before the bench and bar for comment for approximately
sixteen months and that this present draft was revised in light
of the comments received.
   The Conference, after considering these rules, voted approval
of them and transmittal to the Supreme Court with a recommenda­
tion that the Court approve the rules. In so doing, the Conference
                                                                                    (
                                      73 


     also voted approval and reference to the Supreme Court for favor­
     able action certain changes in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
     and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which will be neces­
     sary if the evidence rules are adopted.
                  CIVIL, CRIMINAL AND ApPELLATE RULES

        Judge Maris presented to the Conference certain minor changes
     in the Civil and Criminal Rules required either by changes in the
     law or for corrective reasons which became apparent after the
     rules were originally adopted. The Conference approved these
     changes for transmittal to the Supreme Court with a recommenda­
     tion that they be approved and promulgated.
                            MAGISTRATES RULES

        Judge Maris pointed out to the Conference that at its March
     1969 session it had approved a set of rules to govern the procedure
     of United States magistrates. These rules, which were adopted
     by the Supreme Court on May 19, 1969, were designed as interim
     rules to make it possible for the magistrates then about to be
     appointed in five pilot districts to function in the trial of minor
     offenses.
       Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Criminal
     Rules had continued its study of the magistrates procedure and
     as a result it presented to the standing Committee revised rules for
     the conduct of proceedings before United States magistrates. He
     said further that it was likely that the magistrates system would be­
     come operational throughout the country at about the end of calen­
     dar year 1970. Upon recommendation of the standing Committ€e,
     the Conference approved these revised magistrates rules for trans­
     mittal to the Supreme Court with a recommendation that the
     Court act favorably upon them.
                  SUPPLEMENTAL ELECTRONIC RECORDING

          Judge Maris advised that the standing Committee had been
     concerned with the difficulty in the procurement of the transcript
     of testimony which has become a major source of delay in bringing
     motions for new trials and appeals on for hearing and disposition.
     The Conference approved a Committee recommendation that the
     Administrative Office be authorized to establish in a few selective
I
\.
                                  74
 districts an experimental program for the use of electronic record­
 ing equipment, supplemental to the work of the court reporters, the
 recording of which would be made available to litigants on appeal.          ('\
         FUTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE        RuLES   PROGRAM

    Judge Maris stated that the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules
 had completed the program it began more than ten years ago and
 that the terms of service of the members of that committee expired
 on October 1, 1970. He said that the Advisory Committee on Ad­
 miralty Rules was nearing the completion of its tasks of studying
 the experience of maritime rules under the unified civil rules and in
 revising the supplemental admiralty rules. He stated that both
 the Admiralty Committee and the Advisory Committee on Bank­
 ruptcy Rules may have completed their assignments prior to the
 expiration of the terms of their members on October 1, 1972. With
 the report of the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Evidence,
 which the Conference approved for transmittal to the Supreme
 Court, the work of that committee had been completed. The work
 of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is an on-going pro­
 gram which the standing Committee believes must be continued.
 The standing Committee recommended also the reactivation of the
Aldv~sory Commi~tee II'? the. field 0df civilbProbcedure which would     (,
a so mclude maritIme ItlgatlOn, an possi ly ankruptcy after the
work of the present Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules is
completed. The Conference approved the recommendation that
the Chief Justice be requested to appoint a new Advisory Com­
mittee on Civil Rules when he deems it appropriate.
   Judge Maris said that meanwhile the standing Committee will
continue to study and report on appellate rules and rules of evi­
dence until such time as it may be determined that these areas of
study should be assigned to either the Civil or the Criminal Rules
Committee.
   Because there is at present a crisis in the administration of jus­
tice in the federal courts, caused at least in part by the inordinate
delays resulting from the constantly increasing caseloads, Judge
Maris said that his Committee believes the time has come to con­
sider all serious proposals for modernizing the procedure and im­
proving the efficiency of the courts without impairing the just
determination of litigation no matter how drastic or fundamental

                                                                         (
                                 75 

the proposals may be. He said that the standing Committee recom­
mended that a small ad hoc committee of legal scholars who are
specialists in the field be appointed by the Chief Justice to consider
and report to the Conference a list of those proposals which they
think might be helpful in this regard and which they believe merit
serious discussion and detailed study by an advisory committee and
its reporter. He said that the Committee believes such a program
would be in line with the responsibilities of the Conference under
28 U.S.C. 331. The Conference agreed and voted to authorize the
Chief Justice to constitute such a preliminary study committee as
a joint committee of the Conference and the Federal Judicial Cen­
ter to propose an agenda for modernizing the procedure and im­
proving the efficiency of the courts.

     COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                 JUSTICE ACT 

  Judge John S. Hastings, Chairman of the Committee to Imple­
ment the Criminal Justice Act, presented the report of his
Committee.
                 ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   Judge Hastings presented a cumulative report prepared in the
Administrative Office on appointments and payments under the
Criminal Justice Act from the effective date of the statute, Au­
gust 20, 1965, through June 30, 1970. He stated that the amount
of payments for services rendered has risen steadily each year, with
approximately one-third of the cumulative payments having been
made in fiscal year 1970. During the same year, counsel were ap­
pointed for over 33,000 criminal defendants and appellants. Pay­
ments for investigative, expert and other services, as well as
authorizations for transcripts, also rose sharply during fiscal year
1970. The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to release this cumulative report immediately and to transmit
copies to all federal judges.
                    STATUTORY AMENDMENTS

  On October 14, 1970, the President signed into law a bill making
far-reaching changes in the Act. These amendments extended the
coverage of the Act, providing for increased payments and 8lUthor­
                                 76
ized the establishment of a public defender or community defender
organization. Judge Hastings pointed out that these amendments
would become effective in 120 days or approximately mid-February
                                                                        () I
1971. During this interim period he advised that his Committee,
together with the Administrative Office, was engaged in preparing
                                                                                I
a model revised plan for consideration by each district, as well as
revised guidelines and forms to be used under the Act. The Con­
ference authorized the Committee to submit these proposed plans,
guidelines, forms and other recommendations to the members of                   I
the Conference and request reply by mail vote so that all of the
proposed changes may be in the hands of the district courts and
the courts of appeals well in advance of the effective date of the
                                                                                j
amendments.

      COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
                                                                                I
  Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on Court Administration.
                 JUDICIAL REFORM ACT OF 1969
   Judge Ainsworth advised that certain further technical changes
had been proposed in the provisions of S. 1511, 91st Congress, to       (1
amend the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act but that the Act still         .   !

remains before the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial
Machinery of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Two other amend­
ments to the Act, however, have been referred to the Conference for
comment, namely, S. 3515 and S. 3705, 91st Congress, which would
make provision in the Act for a widow of a judge who has remar­
ried but whose remarriage has been terminated by divorce without
fault on her part. The Conference voted its disapproval of these
two proposed bills.
   Judge Ainsworth stated that his Committee had again considered
S. 1507 providing for the mandatory retirement of justices and
judges at the age of 70 and stated that his Committee recommended
that S. 1507 be approved if redrafted to provide that a judge who
has not served ten years continuously or otherwise when he attains
the age of 70 years shall be retired upon his completion of ten years
of active service. The Conference approved this recommendation.



                                                                        ()
                                  77 

   The views of the Conference have been requested on H.R. 14231
which would provide that a judge who has reached the age of 70
may retire after ten years of service, at the age of 69 after 11 years
of service, at the age of 68 after 12 years of service, at the age of 67
after 13 years of service, at the age of 66 after 14 years of service
and at the age of 65 after 15 years of service. The Conference voted
approval of this legislation provided it were amended to permit a
judge to retire at the age of 64 after 16 years of service, at the age
of 63 after 17 years of service, at the age of 62 after 18 years of
service, at the age of 61 after 19 years of service and at the age of
60 after 20 years of service. The Conference noted that the Com­
mittee, in recommending this amendment, pointed out that such
legislation would have the desirable effect of creating as large a
cadre of senior judges as may reasonably be effective.
                       FINANCIAL REPORTING
  The Conference approved one change in the public report ap­
proved at the March 1970 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 7), namely,
insertion of a footnote in Item 2 entitled "Gifts" which would
read:
     Books and periodicals received from publishers need not
     be included.
                       COURT EXECUTIVES
   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of the principle of court
executives as contained in S. 3916 and H.R. 17901, both bills to
provide for the appointment of court executives in the circuit courts
of appeals on a permissive basis.
    ADDITIONAL DIVISIONS AND PLACES OF HOLDING COURT
   H.R. 17653 would amend Section 122 of Title 28, United States
Code, by providing for the transfer of certain counties in South
Dakota among the four divisions of that judicial district. Upon
recommendation of the judges of the district and the Judicial Coun­
cil of the Eighth Circuit, the Conference approved H.R. 17653
with the amendment that Washabaugh and Bennett Counties
                                 78
should remain in the Western Division of the District of South
Dakota, thus avoiding a split of one Indian reservation between          (._.. "
two divisions.
                       LEGISLATIVE ~IATTERS

   The Conference approved in principle S. 3568 which would
amend the Administrative Procedure Act to permit the naming of
the United States as a defendant. The Conference specifically ap­
proved Section 2 of the bill, eliminating the jurisdictional amount
requirement, and Section 3, providing for suit in the same judicial
districts in which the federal official or agency may be sued.
   S. 4000 and H.R. 18485, relating to compensation to growers,
manufacturers, packers and distributors for damage resulting from
reliance on the official listing of cyclomates as a safe product, were
considered by the Conference to be matters involving legislative
policy on which the Conference should take no action.

                  THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURTS

   The Conference noted from the Committee report the increased
judicial burden which has resulted from the convening of three­
 judge district courts in injunction cases alleging unconstitutionality
of federal or state statutes. Originally, three-judge district courts ( )
 were conceived as a means of allaying concern of state officials
directed at the granting of injunctions against enforcement of state
statutes by a single federal judge. This concern has been lessened
with the passage of time but the Committee reported that not only
has the work of the district and circuit courts been affected by the
need to supply judges for three~judge courts but also the direct
appeal from such courts to the Supreme Court has often brought
that Court into the review process prematurely and placed the
burden of direct appeal on the Supreme Court in many cases where
the winnowing process of appellate review at the circuit court level
would have better served the interests of justice.
   After reviewing the Committee report on this subject, the Con­
ference approved draft legislation and authorized its transmittal
to the 92nd Congress which would amend Sections 2281 and 2282
of Title 28, United States Code, to eliminate the thre~judge district
court requirement. The proposed legislation would provide for .five
days' notice to the Attorney General and the Governor of the
                                  79 

state or the Attorney General of the United States and the United
States Attorney, depending on the statute involved in the litigation.
It would also provide a new section 1259 of Title 28 providing for
the direct review of any preliminary or permanent injunction
granted against enforcement of a state or federal statute for repug­
nance to the Constitution by the appropriate court of appeals or by
the Supreme Court at the election of the Attorney General of the
state or of the United States, depending on the statute in suit.
This legislative proposal would not affect three-judge courts con­
vened for the taking of land by T.V.A., for violations of the 1964
Civil Rights Act, of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, nor would it
cover I.C.C. matters affected by the proposed amendment to the
Expediting Act.

DIVISION OF JURISDICTION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS

   Because of the far-reaching nature of the changes proposed by
the American Law Institute's study on the division of jurisdiction
between state and federal courts, the Conference agreed that these
proposals should be studied by the Congress at an early date so
as to afford an opportunity, through the legislative process, for
all interested parties to be heard. The Conference, therefore,
approved early submission of the A.L.I. study to the Congress for
appropriate legislative examination of the several proposals con­
tained therein for legislation.

                      ADDITION AL JUDGESHIPS

   S. 3361 is a bill to create an additional permanent district judge­
ship in the District of Oregon. The Conference agreed that this
additional judgeship could not be justified under the standard
limiting such requests to emergency situations during the interval
between quadrennial surveys of the district courts. Accordingly,
disapproval of S. 3361 was voted.
  The Conference noted that five judgeships had previously been
approved and recommended to the Congress for additional district
judgeships in the Western District of Missouri,the Southern
District of Florida, the Northern District of Indiana, the Southern
District of Indiana and the Northern District of Texas. The Con­
ference was of the view that the need for an additional judgeship
                                       80 


in each of these five districts constituted an emergency situation
and, therefore, voted to recommend to the Congress the authoriza­
tion of these five additional judgeships at as early a date as possible.

                          SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

   Secretaries to Judges.-The Conference approved a proposal
that a secretary to a federal judge shall receive step increases in
Grade JSP 10 to step 6 at 52-week intervals and from step 6 to
step 10 at 104-week intervals, thus permitting a secretary in
Grade JSP 10 to reach the top of her grade after fourteen years of
service instead of after nineteen as at present.
   The Conference reiterated its support of legislation to place the
retirement annuities of secretaries to judges on the same basis as
the retirement of Congressional secretaries (Conf. Rept., March
1970, p. 12).
   Court Reporters.-Pursuant to the authority vested in the Con­
ference by Public Law 91-272, enacted June 2, 1970, the Conference
approved the raising of the ceiling of court reporters' salaries from
$12,302 to $16,000 per annum. Further, the Conference authorized
the Director of the Administrative Office to increase the tran­
script rates, for original copies only, by no more than ten percent
over existing maximum rates when, in the Director's judgment. ( )
a situation exists in a district which would be classified as unique,
critical and an emergency and when the district court has requested
such action. In addition, the Conference authorized the Director
of the Administrative Office to undertake a long-range study to
cover fully the relationships of court reporters of the district courts.
  Crier-Clerk.-In furtherance of the action of the Conference at
the March 1970 meeting (Conf. Rept., p. 12), the Conference
approved the following qualification standard for the position of
court crier-clerk:
  To qualify for the position of court crier-clerk, Grade JSP 6, a person must
be a high school graduate {)r the equivalent and must have a minimum of two
years of clerical or administrative experience in public service or business; also
at least one year of service In the United States courts as court crier in JSP 5.
   Interpreter.-In view of the creation of an additional judgeship
for the District of Puerto Rico, the Conference authorized an addi­
tional position of Spanish Interpreter for that court at Grade JSP 5.
   Courts of Appeals Personnel.-The Conference authorized 50
additional positions in the clerks' offices of the courts of appeals and
                                     81 

    at least 52 other positions in the courts of appeals, one of which
    would be for a librarian and the others for general secretaries.
    Fifteen of these secretaries are for the judges of the Court of
    Appeals of the Fifth Circuit and nine are for the judges of the Court
    of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit. At least three addi­
    tional secretaries are to be added to the remaining courts of appeals
    as a secretarial pool but the Conference agreed that a second secre­
    tary should be provided for any circuit judge who certifies a need
    for such a second secretarial position.
       Chief Deputy Clerks of Courts of Appeals.-The Conference
    voted to reaffirm its approval of Grade JSP 15 for the chief deputy
    clerks of the courts of appeals. Until this authorization is approved,
    however, the Conference agreed that, unless otherwise proscribed
    by law, the Director was to assign the chief deputy clerks of the
    courts of appeals to that step in Grade JSP 14 which is next below
    the salary for the opening step in Grade JSP 15.
       Law Clerk for Senior ludge.-The Conference agreed that, sub­
    ject to the approval of the circuit council, a circuit judge who takes
    senior status and continues to perform virtually full-time work on
    the court of appeals should be allowed a second law clerk.
       Law Clerk for District ludge.-The Conference approved the
    proposal that any district judge may have two law clerks starting
(   at Grade JSP 11 instead of one law clerk and one court crier or
    crier-law clerk.
    COMMITTEE ON TRIAL PRACTICE AND TECHNIQUE
       Chief Judge Joe E. Estes, Chairman of the Committee on Trial
    Practice and Technique, reported that the Committee was con­
    tinuing its work of preparing sample jury instructions for use in
    certain types of tax cases. Work on instructions in cases involving
    questions of fraud, accumulated earnings, depreciation, valuation,
    bad debt reserves, business expenses, and corporate loans or divi­
    dends is now being completed. These sample instructions will be
    distributed to all district judges, as they become available, in
    accordance with previous Conference authorization.
       The Committee is also continuing its studies of procedural prob­
    lems arising in class actions in common disaster cases, procedure in
    three-judge court cases, and the administration and control of in­
    dividual calendars in a large district court. The results of these
    studies will be reported to the Conference at future sessions.

              COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
   Judge Carl A. Weinman, Chairman of the Committee on the
Budget, presented the report of the Committee.                          (J
   Judge Weinman noted that, because it was necessary to submit
a proposed budget for the judiciary to the Office of Management
and Budget prior to October 15, his Committee's recommendations
had been submitted by mail vote and approved by Conference
members. He noted that these budget estimates for fiscal year 1972,
exclusive of the United States Supreme Court, the Customs Court
and the Federal Judicial Center, aggregated $155,621,000, an in­
crease of $22,467,000 over the amounts appropriated for fiscal year
1971, adjusted to reBect proposed supplementals for pay costs.
   The budget was so prepared as to anticipate Conference approval
of several items involving supporting personnel. It further proposes
that the limitation with respect to the chief judge of each circuit
for secretaries and law clerks be increased from $47,835 to $55,933
and that the limitation with respect to other circuit judges be in­
creased from $36,966 to $45,064.
   The Conference further authorized the submission to the Con­
gress of a request for supplemental appropriations for pay costs
for fiscal year 1971 and other supplemental appropriations as might
be necessary.
   The Conference approved changes on the aggregate salaries of
                                                                        () 

secretaries and law clerks to circuit judges to permit the employ­
ment of an additional secretary in Grade JSP 7.
   The Conference also approved a transfer to the Federal Judicial
Center of the funds appropriated for the operation of the Federal
Probation Center in Chicago and for the conduct of in-service in­
stitutes for probation officers.
   The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to submit to Congress a request to delete from the judiciary
appropriation bill the general provisions relating to the District of
Columbia's share of expenses of the federal courts in view of the
specific provisions contained in the District of Columbia's Court
Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970.
                                                                             I

                            SPECIAL COMMITTEE

            On the motion of Chief Judge Lumbard, the Conference approved
         the establishment of a special committee to study state prisoner
         litigation in the federal courts. Judge Lumbard noted that such
         prisoner petitions now number upwards of 12,000 each year and
         constitute a very heavy burden on the federal court system.

         PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS

            The Conference approved the pretermission of terms of courts
         of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48 as might be necessary prior to
         the next session of the Conference, particularly those sessions of
         the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to be held at Ashe­
         ville, North Carolina, and those terms of the Court of Appeals for
         the Eighth Circuit which might be held in places other than St.
         Louis, Missouri.

                   RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION
            The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action
         on matters considered at this session where necessary for legisla­
         tive or administrative action.
            For the Judicial Conference of the United States.
                                              WARREN    E.   BURGER,
                                    Chief Justice of the United States.
           DECEMBER   28, 1970.
