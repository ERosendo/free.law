accordance with law.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE AD:\.lINISTRATIVE
    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   The Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Rowland F. Kirks,
presented a short written report to the Conference covering the
highligh ts of the status of judicial business of the federal courts dur­
ing t.he six-month period ending on December 31,1974.
   During the six-month period Mr. Kirks ad;ised that the number
of appeals filed was 7,959 as compared to 8,044 filed in the compa­
rable period for fiscal year 1974. Appeals terminated rose by
approximately seven percent during the first half of the fiscal year
but even with the rise of the termination rate the appeals backlog
rose to 11,778 as of December 31,1974, or 3.6 percent over the num­
ber pending a year prior.
   The civil case filings rose in the first half of 1975 by 14 percent.
Although the rate of terminations also rose by 7.5 percent, the back­
log of civil cases grew to 113,432, six percent higher than the pend­
ing caseload on June 30,1974.
   Mr. Kirks advised that the downward trend marked in the last
two years in criminal cases appears to be reversing during the first
six months of 1975. Criminal filings numbered 20,354, nearly nine


     575-944 0 - 75   2
                                  4

percent higher than the comparable period of the prior year. In the
criminal case area the district courts were able to keep pace with
the increased filing rate. There were 20,546 cases terminated and,
thus, the pending caseload dropped by nearly one percent during
the first half of the year and was down more than four percent
below the backlog of one year ago.
   Bankruptcy filings reflected a 33 percent increase over the com­
parable period of the prior year. The number of new filings were
116,644 and approximately 92,000 cases were terminated during the
first six months of fiscal year 1975 as compared to less than 84,000
during the same period of 1974.

              COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
   Judge Carl A. Weinman, Chairman of the Budget Committee,
reported to the Conference on the recently concluded hearings
before the Subcommittee on Appropriations of the House of Repre­
sentatives. Judge Weinman also circulated to the Conference copies
of his statement to the Appropriations Committee.
   Judge Weinman stated that the total requested for fiscal year
1976 for the courts of appeals and district courts was $235,588,000,
representing a ten percent increase over the adjusted appropria­
tions for 1975. Of the total increase of $21,260,000, approximately
half or $10.6 millon represented mandatory increases, such as pay
costs and other statutory or uncontrollable items of expense.

                  COURT ADMINISTRATION
  The report of the Committee on Court Administration was pre­
sented by the Chairman, Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr.

                         JUDICIAL DISABILITY

   The Conference considered the recommendations of the Com­
mittee relating to S. 4153, 93rd Congress, a bill referred by the Sen­
ate Judiciary Committee for comment. The proposed bill pro­
vides for the establishment of a Council on Judicial Tenure to be
composed of 14 judges elected for three-year terms. The Council is
charged with the duty to receive and investiga.te complaints against
a justice or judge of the United States and to determine whether the
complaint alleges grounds which would warrant removal, censure or
involuntary retirement. The bill provides for investigation, hear­
                                       5

ing and appeal to the Judicial Conference and, ultimately, to the·
Supreme Court. After consideration of this legislation and prior bills
of a similar import which have been considered by the Conference
over a period of years, the Conference agreed that, with the sug­
gestions expressed in paragraphs 1-5, it would approve in principle
the legislation proposed by S. 4153, without approving the specific
provisions of the bill. The suggestions expressed by the Conference
are:
  1. That any reference to Justices of the Supreme Court be eliminated inas­
much as sufficient mE'ans exist through the impeachment process and further
that it would be inappropriate for judges of the inferior courts to pass judg­
ment on the action of a Justice of the Supreme Court. Moreover, the Judicial
Conference has no jurisdiction over the Supreme Court;
  2. That neither a judge nor a Justice of the United States may be removed
from office except by the impeachment process;
  3. That following a hearing before a commission of the type proposed in
S. 4153, following review by the Judicial Conference of the United States and
further review by the Supreme Court of the United States, mandatory or invol­
untary retirement of a judge for physical or mental disability (including
habitual intemperance) may be ordered, with the judge so charged ,being relieved
of his judicial duties;
  4. That a judge similarly may be mandatorily (or involuntarily) retired for
serious misconduct and he may LJe l'elievE'd of any furthE'r judicial duties; and
   5. That the censure of a judge following a hearing before such a commission
with review and appeal may be imposed as a less severe sentence than manda­
tory or involuntary retirement.

                 MANDATORY RETIREMENT OF JUDGES

  The Conference voted to disapprove S.J. Res. 226, 93d Congress,
which would amend the Constitution to provide that no person
seventy years of age or over be appointed a judge of the United
States and that upon reaching seventy-five years of age any judge
shall retire from regular active service, with the exception of a
judge who has not yet qualified for retirement. The Conference
was of the view that the provision relating to appointment was
unnecessary inasmuch as the Senate, through its confirmation
process, has complete control over the question of the age of a judge
upon appointment. Insofar as retirement is concerned, the Con­
ference has previously expressed the view that a Constitutional
amendment is unnecessary. At the October 1970 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 76) and at the October 1971 session (Conf. Rept., p. 77),
the Conference had endorsed the concept of the mandatory retire­
ment of a judge at the age of seventy, provided that a judge who
                                 6


has not served ten years continuously or otherwise when he attains
the age of seventy shall be retired upon his completion of ten
years of active service.

                JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY ACT

   At the September 1974 session, the Conference referred for fur­
ther study a recommendation of the Judicial Council of the Sixth
Circuit which would permit a widow of a judge who is receiving
benefits under the Act to continue to receive such benefits in the
event of remarriage (Conf. Rept., p. 48). The Committee sub­
mitted to the Conference a detailed report as to the reasons for its
recommendation that the proposal be disapproved. The report
pointed out that the Judicial Survivors Annuity fund has for many
years been in financial distress and that increasing the class of
beneficiaries would render previous actuarial studies unreliable and
inaccurate and, further, that the Act at present provides that any
beneficiary, whether it be a widow who has remarried or otherwise,
is entitled to receive an annuity during the years following the
judge's death in an amount equal to the sum paid in by such judge,
with interest. Consequently, a widow who remarries is not neces­
sarily completely excluded from benefits under the Act. The Con­
ference agreed with the Committee report disapproving the
recommendation of the Judicial Council of the Sixth Circuit.
   The Conference also received a report from Judge Oren Har~is
who has been previously designated by the Conference to work
with the Administrative Office and the Conference in connection
with proposed amendments to the Judicial Survivors Annuity
Act.
                OPINIONS OF BANKRUPTCY JUDGES

   The Conference approved in principle a proposal to provide
bankruptcy judges with complimentary copies of a publication in
return for receiving copies of opinions of bankruptcy judges, thus,
eliminating the requirement in such instances of charging for such
opinions.
                     SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

Supervisory Clerical Position in Probation Offices
  The Conference approved an amendment to the Judicial Salary
Plan to provide the establishment of a separate formula for deter­
mining the grades of supervisory clerical positions in probation
                                   7


offices, gauged primarily to the number of positions supervised;
the establishment of two new compensation categories-(l) pro­
bation clerk, grades JSP 3-4-5 and (2) senior probation clerk,
grades JSP 4-5-6 in lieu of probation clerk-stenographer, grades
JSP 4-5, which is abolished, and the establishment of a position of
secretary to the chief probation officer, grades JSP 6--7-8 which is
authorized for the largest probation offices upon demonstration of
need.
Satellite Libraries-Courts of Appeals
    The Conference approved a pilot project for satellite libraries
ill the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in those cities other than
where the central library is located. The positions in the satellite
libraries shall not be higher than grade JSP 7 and the normal quali­
fications and standards approved by the Conference for library
personnel at the appropriate level shall control minimum require­
ments. There shall be no more than one library position at each
location. Personnel shall operate under the guidance of the chief
circuit librarian under a plan formulated by the court of appeals
for coordination of and overall responsibility for total circuit satel­
lite effort. The judicial council of the circuit and the Administrative
Office, as well as the Conference committee, are to submit a full
report of the operation of the satellite plan at the fall meeting of
the Conference in 1977.
   The Conference also agreed to ask the Federal Judicial Center to
conduct a study designed to eliminate the artificial distinction
between the courts of appeals and district court libraries and to
avoid duplication of libraries and duplication in the separate
offices of judges.
Salaries of Secretaries of Judges
   On request of the Federal Judicial Secretaries Association the
Committee, through the Subcommittee on Supporting Personnel,
conducted a study of the grades of secretaries considering a wide
variety of data, a review of comparative salaries in various locali­
ties, as well as prior studies of this subject matter. The Conference
agreed with the Committee's conclusion that no grade changes in
the secretarial field are warranted at this time. The Conference
did, however, reaffirm its support of legislation to provide acceler­
ated within-grade salary increases for secretaries to judges (Conf.
Rept., April 1973, p. 6).
                                       8

Senior Law Clerks-Courts of Appeals
  In accordance with a directive of the Conference at its Septem­
ber 1974 session (Conf. Rept., p. 50) approving the concept of a
senior law clerk in every court of appeals, the Conference approved
the following qualification standard for such position.
  In addition to the qualifications required of a law clerk, grade JSP 12, to a
federal judge, candidates must possess an additional five years of progressively
responsible experience in legal research, administration of a body of law or as a
practicing attorney.
  The incumbent performs under the general supervision of the chief judge of a
court of appeals.
The Conference agreed that a salary of up to $30,000 per annum be
fixed by each court for the position of senior law clerk, for which
statutory authority now exists and for which funds have been re­
quested so that each court of appeals may be able to appoint a
senior law clerk during fiscal year 1976.
Substitute Court Reporters
   Because of the inordinate delays that have taken pHwe through­
out the system in the preparation of transcripts by court reporters
in cases that are being appealed, the Conference agreed that substi­
tute reporters should be employed to service the requirements of
the district judge where the official court reporter is unable to com­
plete his transcripts in a timely fashion and that the salary of the
official reporter be subject to withholdings not to exceed the sum
necessary to compensate the substitute reporter until the tran­
scripts are current. The need for substitute reporter service is to be
determined by the district judge affected or by the chief judge of the
circuit, at his option, acting through the circuit executive.
Court Criers
   The Conference agreed with a proposal that a line item ap­
propriation in the budget be sought to implement the action of
the Conference at the March 1970 session providing a new clas­
sification of crier/clerk at one step higher than the present classi­
fication of court crier (JSP 5) provided that the judge certifies
that the crier/clerk is performing clerical duties in addition to
those of court crier.
                         ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

  The Conference voted its disapproval of S. 3712, 93rd Con­
gress, to provide an additional permanent district judgeship for
                                         9

the District of Connecticut. The Conference noted that while there
has been a rapid increase in total filings in the district over the
past five years, nevertheless, 45 other districts had greater filings
per judgeship than Connecticut's 374. Further, it has been the
policy of the Conference t.o r-ecommend additional judgeships on
a quadrennial basis unless an emergency exists. Inasmuch as there
is no emergency situation in the District of Connecticut and since
the district's needs for an additional judgeship will be reviewed,
in depth, in the 1976 quadrennial survey, the Conference disap­
proved S. 3712.
                            LAND CONDEMNATION

   The Judicial Conference at the September 1972 (Con£. Rept., p.
39) session authorized a two-year trial period for proposed standard
guidelines relating to land condemnation cases for use in at least six
district courts on a voluntary basis. Eleven district courts responded
and all but one expressed the opinion that the proposed standard
guidelines were a substantial improvement over the former prac­
tices and resulted in definite benefits in management and adminis·
tration of condemnation proceedings and assured a finality of judg­
ment at a much earlier time. In addition, the statistics are regarded
as more realistic and record-keeping is simplified. Accordingly, the
Conference approved the following proposed standard guidelines
and recommended them to the federal district courts for use on an
optional basis:
   (1) For each tract, economic unit or ownership for which the just compensa­
tion is required to be separately determined in a total lump sum, there shalr
lJe a separate civil action file opened by the clerk, which shall be given a serial
numlJer, as given all other civil actions. For each such civil action a separate J.S.
5 card shall be prepared on filing and a separate J.S. 6 card prepared on closing
of each such separate civil action. The condemnor's counsel shall.malm the initial
determination of each tract, economic unit or ownership for which just com­
pensation is required to be separately determined ina lump sum, subject to
review lJy the court after filing.
   (2) The file in the civil action containing the first complaint filed under a
single declaration of taking shall be designated as the Master IPile for aU the
civil actions based upon the single declaration of taking. The numerical desig­
nation as the Master File shall be shown by adding as a suffix to the civil action
serial number the symbol MF                 (In the blank shall be inserted a code
number or numbers, selected by the condemnor, designating the project or proj­
ects and the number assigned the declaration of taking with which the property
concerned is connected.) The single declaration of taking shall be filed in the
Master File only. In all other civil actions for condemnation of property which
is the subject of the declaration of taking, an appropriate reference to the
                                              10 

:\laster J;'ile nUlllber in a standard form of complaint shall be deemed to in­
corporate in the causc the declaration of taking by reference. and shall be a
sufficient filing of the (leclaration of taking rl'ferred to.
   J;'or example, assuming tha t the civil action serial numller assign"(l to the first
complaint 11l1der a single declaration of taking is C.A. 72-20,000, that the project
llUlllb('r selected by tIle condelllnor is GOO and the declarn tion of taking' is til ..
first in the project, the :\laster File ,,"umber would be C.A. 72-20,000-:\11<' ,,00-1
    (3) For tIl<' ch'il action designated as the :\lastpr File there shall IJe a separate
complaint. At the option of the condemnor this COlnlJlaint and exhibits shall (1)
describe all owners, anll other parties affected and all properties that are the
subjert of the decla ra tion of taking, or (2) dcscribe only the owner or owners of
the first !lropert~' or [Jropertil's in the declarnti(JIl of taking for which the issue
of just compensation is separately determinable;
   (-1) In order to reduce administrative, clerical and secretarial work a standar(l
form of complaint (printed, photocopies, mimeographed or otherwise produced
in numbers) may be used for each civil action filecl to condemn a tract, economic
unit or ownership for which the issue of just l'ompensation is required to be
detpflnined in a single lump sum. In the body of the complaint it shall not
Le necessa ry to designa te the owner or owners of the property concerned, other
parties affected by the civil action, or to describe the property concerned in the
ch'il action. The names of the owners. and other parties affected, and the de­
scrivtion of the property concerned in the civil action may be set forth in an
exhibit or exhibits incorporated by reference in the standard form of complaint
and attacll<'d thereto;
    (5) In any notice or IJrOCeSs required or permitted by law or by the Rule~ of
Civil Procedure (including hut not limited to process under Rule 71A(d),
F.R.CiY.P.) the condemnor, at its option. may combine in a single notice or
process, notiee or process in as many separate civil actions as it may choose in
the interests of economy and efficiency.

   (6) A district court should adopt a local rule or general order
to the effect that the filing of a declaration of taking in the Master
File constitutes a filing of the same in each of the actions to which it
relates. *
                                       LEGISLATION

  (1) The Conference considered H.R. 16152, 93rd Congress, which
was referred for comment by the House Judiciary Committee. This

    • An essential element of the Master File System Is that the filing of the declaration of
taking in the Master File shall constitute a filing of the same In each of the separate
actions to which the Master File relates. This Is of particular significance because the
Declaration of Taking Act, 40 U.S.C. § 258a, specifies filing of the declaration of taking
"In the cause." If the filing of the declaration of taking is defective, the vesting of the
title to the subject property In the United States under the Act Is jeopardized. To ensure
that the filing of a pleading In the Master File will legally constitute a filing in the several
related actions, It is considered necessary that cach district court as part of the Imple­
mentation of this system, adopt a local rule of procedure giving the desired effect to the
filing of pleadings In the lIiaster File. The following language for such a rule Is suggested:
"Where the United States files separate condemnation actions and a single declaration
of taking relating to those separate actions, the clerk Is authorized to establish a Master
File In which the declaration of taking may be filed, and the filing of the declaration of
taking therein shall constitute a filing of the same in each of the actions to which It
                                        11 

bill would amend Title 28 of the United States Code to permit the
cumulation of amounts in controversy as between the members
of a class in class actions. The bill, in effect, would reverse legis­
latively the Supreme Court opinions in Snyder v. Harris, 394 U.S.
332 (1969), and Zahn v. International Paper Company, 414 U.S.
291 (1973). On considering the provisions of this bill the Confer­
ence was agreed in opposing legislation of this type insofar as it
affects diversity cases. As to cases involving federal question juris­
diction, the Conference agreed that such legislation involved a
matter of policy for the determination of Congress.
   The Conference also suggested that the Congress might wish to
consider other procedural devices to achieve the objectives of the
legislation and further suggested that the Congress consider the
impact of legislation of this nature upon the judicial process.
   (2) H.R.14227, 93d Congress, would establish an Antitrust Revi­
sion Commission to study the operation of the existing antitrust
statutes, including the enforcement procedures of the Department
of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies, and
make recommendations for improvement. The Conference was
agreed that this legislation involved a policy judgment on the
part of the Congress and, accordingly, took no position with respect
to it.
                      REVIEW COMMITTEE
  The report of the Review Committee was presented by the
Chairman, Judge Edward A. Tamm.
  Judge Tamm's report was largely informational. It did point
out that several judicial officers were late in filing their reports.
He said that the judicial officers who had not as of the convening
of the Conference on March 6 filed reports of extrajudicial income
for the period July 1 through December 31, 1974 are:
   Listing, by Circuit, of Judicial Officers who have not, as of March 6, 1975,

   JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE CODE OF JUDICIAL
                  CONDUCT
  The report of the Joint Committee was presented by Judge
Elbert P; Tuttle, who with Judge Tamm is co-chairman of the
Committee.
  The Conference on recommendation of the Committee approved
the following amendments to the Code of Judicial Conduct for
United States Judges adopted by the Conference at the April
1973 session (Con£. Rept., p. 9) to bring it into conformity with the
new Judicial Disqualification Statute, 28 U.S.c. 455.
   1. That the first sentence of Canon 3C(1) is amended to read as
follows:
  "(1) A judge ~la shall disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his im­
partiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances
where; * * * *"
   2. That Canon 3C (1) (b) is amended to read: .
  "(b) he .~erved as lawyer in the matter in cOntroversy. or a lawyer with whom
he previously practiced law Hen'ed during such association as a lawyer concern­
ing the matter, or the j'Hlge or such lawyer has been a material witness eoncern­
ing it ;" (new language italic).

   3. That the commentary following Canon 3C(1)(b) is stricken
from the Code.
                                        13 


  4. That a new subsection (e) is added to Canon 3CO) as follows:
  "( e) he has sen'ed in goYernmental employment and in such capacity partici­
pated as counsel, adYisel', or material witness concerning the proceeding or
expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy;"
  5. That Canon 3C(3) is amended by adding the following sub­
division (d) relating to the definition of the word "proceeding":
   "( d) 'proceeding' includes pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of
litiga Uon."
   6. That Canon 3D relating to a remittal of disqualification is
t3tricken from the Code.

  ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES
  Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman of the Advisory Committee,
presented the report to the Conference.
  Judge Tuttle advised that since the last report to the Confer­
ence four formal opinons have been issued, bringing to 42 the total
number of such opinions released by the Committee. Since the last
session of the Conference 17 new requests for formal opinions were
received, of which seven were initiated by the Review Committee.
The Committee is current in its work of processing requests for
opinions.

        COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE 

                   JURY SYSTEM 

  The report of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury Sys­
tem was presented by its Chairman, Judge Arthur J. Stanley.

               FEDERAL EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION ACT

   The Conference approved draft legislation for transmittal to the
Congress which will bring within the coverage of the Federal Em­
ployees Compensation Act any injury or disability to a juror arising
from service as a federal juror. The Conference recognized that
Public Law 93-416 genera.Ily amended the federal injury compen­
sation laws to blanket any federal employees serving as federal
jurors. The Conference is of the view, however, that since a vast
number of jurors are not federal employees and yet perform a vital
public service, they should be included within the terms of the
Compensation Act.
                                 14 


                        FEDERAL JURY FEES

   Judge Stanley reported that at the time hearmgs were held in the
93rd Congress on S. 3265, the jury fee bill, and prior to passage of
that bill by the Senate in essentially the form recommended by the
Judicial Conference, proposals were made to amend that legisla.­
tion to require the Judicial Conference to report to the Congress
periodically on factors such as the economic hardship which jury
service imposes upon citizens, the frequency with which citizens are
excused because of economic hardship and the impact of such ex­
cuses upon representation on juries of a fair cross-section of the
community, as well as any recommendation that the Conference
would have. In studying these recommendations, the Com­
mittee appointed a special committee to study the problems and in
so doing the Committee availed itself of a study made under
L.E.A.A. auspices relating primarily to state jury service. Five fed­
eral courts have been designated for comparative study by the
L.E.A.A. team and the Conference agreed to allow them to do rea­
sonable research on the economics of jury service in the four district
courts within the scope of existing statutory authority.

              JUROR QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE

  The Committee recommended and the Conference approved a
revised juror qualification questionnaire designed with the aid of
the Administrative Office and field personnel.

                         PERIODIC REPORTS

   The Conference was advised that the Committee had received a
compilation of data reflecting the race and sex constituency of
master jury wheels and jurors actually reporting for service from
several district courts. The Conference authorized that copies of
the analysis and summary be made available to the pertinent courts
involved and requested that the chief judges of the respective dis~
tricts, after careful examination of the results, consult with the
Federal Judicial Center which, in turn, will report to the Committee
prior to the next regular session of the Conference.
   The Conference, pursuant to the requirements of the Jury Selec~
tion and Service Act, has issued regulations and approved forms to
monitor the race and sex balance of all master jury wheels in the
district courts. In implementation of these regulations, the Con­
                                        15 


ference agreed to the three recommendations of the Committee and
directed their implementation by the Administrative Office:
   (1) Each time juror qualification questionnaires are sent out, the cJerk will
make a random sample of returned questionnaires and report the results on a
modified JS-12 form. The sampling method and sample size will be prescri\)ed
\)y the AdministraU"I'e Office. It is not necessary that all samples be drawn at the
same time. It is better that they be drawn at the time of wheel·filling for each
district, whenever that may be.
   (2) After the questionnaires have been processed and qualifications deter­
mined, the clerk will draw a random sample of qualified questionnaires and
report the results on the modified JS-12 form.
   (3) Sampling of qualified questionnaires should supplant the collection of
data on jurors reporting for duty, whicb is presently reported on Part III of the
JS-12. Much more can be learned a\)out the effect of excuses and exemptions by
sampling the qualified questionnaires than by recording race and sex of jurors
reporting for duty. Nothing significant will be lost, and the burdens on clerks
will be reduced.
                            PETIT JURY HANDBOOK

  .The Conference approved a revised handbook for jurors and
requested the Committee to study a preparation of a handbook in
the future which might be both more readable and useful for federal
Jurors.

   CO~1MITTEE           ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

                           CRIMINAL LAW 

  Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli, the Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law.

                        SPEEDY TRIAL ACT OF           1974
  Judge Zirpoli advised the Conference that the Speedy Trial Act
of 1974 will have a profound impact upon both the district courts
and the courts of appeals. He stated that the Administrative Office
and the Federal Judicial Center have appointed coordinators to
work together with a representative of the Department of Justice
in order to assist the courts in discharging their obligations under
the statute, commencing July 1,1975. The Conference in discussing
the impact of the Speedy Trial Act on the court system directed
that the Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law
would have general authority on behalf of the Conference to super­
vise the administration and implementation of Title I of the Speedy
Trial Act. The Conference voted authority to the Committee in
conjunction, where necessary, with the Advisory Committee on
                                 16 


Criminal Rules to amend the plans adopted under Rule 50(b) of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to suggest model district
plans and guidelines in implementation of both the first phase of
the Speedy Trial Act, which must be completed by September 29,
1975, and to continue work on the further implementation of the
Act thereafter.

           REVISION OF THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL CODE

  At the four previous sessions of the Conference held in 1973 and
1974 the Committee reported on phases of three proposals for the
revision of the Federal Criminal Code; one submitted by the Brown
Commission, one submitted by the Senate as S. I, 93rd Congress,
and a third containing the views of the Department of Justice,
introduced as S. 1400, 93rd Congress. Judge Zirpoli stated that S. 1
as introduced in the 94th Congress takes into account the opinions
received from aU sources on the three prior proposals, including
an acceptance of several of the recommendations made by the
Committee and previously approved by the Judicial Conference.
The Committee, however, made certain specific proposals and com­
ments relating to the new S. I, 94th Congress, which the Conference
approved and requested Judge Zirpoli to present to the Congress
at the time hearings are held on S. I, as follows:
Matters Relating to Construction
   Section 112(a) of the new S. 1 would abrogate the rule of strict
construction. The Committee expressed its objections to this pro­
vision, and the Conference concurred in this view at the April
1973 session (Conf. Rept., p. 15). The Conference agreed that the
abrogation of the rule will introduce a litigable issue at the trial
and appellate levels without corresponding benefits to the litigants.
The Conference agreed that introducing the words ltfair import of
their terms to effectuate the general purpose of this title" as a
rule of construction might result in an undesirable imprecision in
drafting criminal legislation and in unnecessary constitutional
confrontations.
Jurisdic tion
   Judge Zirpoli reported that S. 1, 93rd Congress, and S. 1400, 93rd
Congress, would generate the least expansion of federal jurisdic­
tion and were, therefore, preferable to the National Commission
approach. He advised that this preference had been accepted in
                                      17 


the draft of S. 1, 94th Congress. The new bill recognizes the con­
cern for the efficient administration of court calendars which are
dependent upon a wise and sensitive exercise of prosecutorial dis­
cretion by requiring in an amendment to 28 U.S.C. 5'22 that the
Attorney General submit annual reports to the Congress, setting
forth the number of prosecutions commenced during the preceding
fiscal year under each section of Title 18, identifying the number
of such prosecutions commenced under each jurisdictional base
applicable to each such section.
Culpable States of Mind
  S. 1, 94th Congress, classifies the offense elements into (1) con­
duct, (2) circumstances surrounding the conduct, and (3) the re­
sults of the conduct, and then defines the state of mind with
relation to each. The Conference agreed that this complex pro­
cedure is a matter of concern; that it will undoubtedly be pro­
ductive of unnecessary litigation; that it will confuse judges and
juries and that it may perhaps cause injustice. The Conference
agreed with the Committee recommendation that the preferred
definitions are:
  A person engages in cond uct :
   (1) "knowingly" if, when he engages in the conduct, he does so voluntarily
and not by mistali:e, accident or other innocent reason;
   (2) "intentionally" if, when he engages in the conduct, he does so knowingly
and with the purpose of doing that which the law prohibits or failing to do that
which the law requires;
   (3) "recklessly" if, when he engages in conduct with respect to a material
element of an offense, he disregards II risk of which he is aware that the mate­
rial element exists or will result from his conduct. His disregard of that risk
must involve a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable per­
son would observe in the situation; except that awareness of the risk is not
required where its absence is due to voluntary intoxication;
   (4) "negligently" if, when he engages in conduct with respect to a material
element of an offense, he fails to be aware of a risk that the material element
exists or will result from his conduct. His failure to perceive that risk must
involve a gross deviation from the standard of care" that a reasonable person
would obscrve in the situation.
Bars to Prosecution
  Section 511 provides that a prosecution for an offense neces­
sarily include in the offense charged shall be considered to be timely
commenced even though the period of limitation for such included
offense has expired," if the period for limitation for the offense
charged has not expired and there is, after the close of evidence
                                  18 


at the trial, sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for the of­
fense charged. This is contrary to existing law and the Conference
agreed with the Committee that the rationale for a lesser period
of time for a lesser offense applies whether it is the offense charged
or a lesser included offense.
   Section 512 provides that immaturity prevents prosecution,
other than for murder, of any person under sixteen years of age
but does not bar a juvenile delinquency proceeding under Chapter
36, Subchapter A (Sections 3601-36(6). The Conference expressed
concern that the formulation of Section 512 does not treat the
problem of persons less than sixteen years old committing minor
offenses in areas under exclusive control of the United States and
urged that specific authority be granted magistrates to deal with
such cases.
Defenses
   Under this heading appear the following defenses: Section 521.
Mistake of Fact or Law; Section 522. Insanity; Section 523. Intoxi­
cation; Section 531. Duress; Section 541. Exercise of Public Author­
ity; Section 542. Protection of Persons; Section 543. Protection of
Property; Section 551. Unlawful Entrapment; and Section 552.
Official Misstatement of Law.
   The Conference agreed with the Committee's criticisms, which
are generally applicable to all of these defenses: that codification
is not necessary or desirable. The Conference noted particularly
that Section 522 on insanity contains a formulation not previously
considered by the Committee or the Conference. It treats mental
disease or defect as a defense only when the state of mind required
as an element of the offense is lacking as a result of mental disease
or defect. The Conference agreed with the Committee recommen­
dation that this section should not be codified but if a section on
mental disease or defect be included, it favors the adoption of the
National Commission's version. This follows the formulation of the
American Law Institute.
   It is believed that Section 522, as drafted, would freeze the in­
sanity defense and not permit changing concepts and knowledge
to work their way into the law. This would only serve to increase
litigation and confuse juries. The Conference agreed with the need
of an alternative verdict "not guilty by reason of insanity" but ex­
pressed the view that such a verdict should be incorporated in the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
                                 19 

   Section 551 relating to unlawful entrapment also involves codi­
fication of an offense which the Conference believes should not be
codified because of the intricacies inherent in evolving legal con­
cepts. Further, important procedural issues, such as the type of
proof needed to raise the issue of entrapment, whether the defense
may be pleaded inconsistently and the kinds of evidence admissible
to show predisposition, are not codified.
OfJenses of General Applicability
   The Conference favors substitution in Section 1001, criminal
attempt, of the phrase "intent to commit" in place of "state of
mind required for the commission of a crime" and the substitution
of "substantial step" for "amounts to more than mere preparation
for, and indicates his intent to complete." The Conference agreed
with the Committee recommendation that a clearer formulation
would read "A person is guilty of an offense, if acting with intent
to commit a crime, he intentionally engages in conduct which, in
fact, constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the
crime."
   As to Section 1002, criminal conspiracy, the Conference prefers
the present language "do any act to effect the object of the con­
spiracy" to the language in S. 1 "engages in any conduct with in­
tent to effect any objective of the agreement."
   Section 1003, criminal solicitation, previously criticized by the
Conference, was again regarded as defective in that there is no
demonstrated need for a general provision on solicitation; the pro­
vision is fraught with the potential for abuse as a prosecutorial
tool; and the substance of the proposal is already covered by the
provisions on complicity~accomplices. The Conference reaffirmed
the view that the defense of renunciation is too closely circum­
scribed.
   In discussing S. 1 members of the Conference again expressed
great concern that if this legislation is enacted, new forms of jury
instructions will be required and appellate courts will be called
upon to review the correctness of new instructions and that all of
these factors will have a serious impact on the work of all federal
courts.
  ,Members of the Conference continued to express the view that
a traditional recodification of the existing statutes would serve all
the purposes of a completely new code redefining federal crimes.
Some expressed the view that if such a comprehensive code is to

     575-944 0 - 75 - 4
                                 20 

replace all present federal criminal statutes, the present time was
most inappropriate in view of the rising caseloads, new classes of
litigation and the adjustments necessary to meet the Speedy Tria]
Act over the next five years.
Review of Sentencing
   Judge Zirpoli advised the Conference that his Committee did not
make any further recommendation on the provision of S. 1 relating
to appellate review of sentencing inasmuch as the Conference has
already firmly expressed itself in opposition to this concept. He
reiterated the view of his Committee presented to the September
1974 session of the Judicial Conference (Conf. Rept., p. 58) that
the Committee favors the alternative to appellate review of sen­
tences provided by the proposed amendment to Rule 35 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure with certain modifications,
as follows: (1) that the panel of review judges consist of one circuit
and two district judges, (2) that membership on the panel be
rotated as far as is practicable in the discretion of the assigning
judge and (3) that the motion to review such sentences shall apply
to any sentence which may result in imprisonment regardless of
the period thereof.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 

             PROBATION SYSTEM 


   The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Proba­
tion System was presented by the Chairman, Judge Albert C.
Wollenberg.
                      SENTENCING INSTITUTE

  The Conference considered and approved a tentative agenda for
a sentencing institute for the Ninth Circuit. The institute was
originally scheduled to be held at Long Beach, California, on
April 29~May 2, 1975. The Conference approved an alternative
date of October or November, 1975, for the institute, as well as the
place, participants and agenda.

                      CARRYING OF FIREARMS

   At the September 1973 session (Con£. Rept., p. 73) the Con­
ference approved a revision of the Probation Officers Manual to
provide that firea.rms may be carried by probation officers only
                                          21 


when consistent with state law and with the express approval of
the court and after appropriate training. At that time the Con­
ference instructed the Committee to study the desirability of a
federal statute to permit probation officers to carry firearms.
Although the Committee at the March 1974 session (Conf. Rept.,
p. 30) recommended such a statute, the Committee has, after
further study, recommended to the Conference that in lieu of a
statute a policy statement on the subject be adopted. The Con­
ference agreed to the following statement of policy:
   It is the policy of the Judicial Conference of tlle United States that probation
officers should not be permitted to carry firearms in the performance of their
official duties unless an assignment, in the judgment of the chief probation officer
or the district judge, subjects a probation officer to serious risk of physical harm
and the services of a law enforcement officer ill accompanying the probation
officer would not be appropriate in the opinion of the chief probation officer. Such
prolJation officer may be permitted to carry a firearm under these conditions:
     I. 	A. The law of the state permits the carrying of a firearm by a probation
              officer.
         B. 	The probation officer has obtained aU necessary licenses or permits
              required for the carrying of firearms.
         C. 	 The probation officer has presented to the chief probation officer suf­
              ficient reasons in writing why the carrying of a firearm is reasonably
              necessary:
               (l) 	in the performance of his duties generally. or
              (2) 	in the performance of duty in a specified assignment.
         D. 	The permission of the chief probation officer has been granted in
              writing.
         E. 	 The chief judge of the court has been given actual notice in writing
              of the permission granted to carry a firearm and he has not objected
              within 48 hours of the notice.
    II. 	No probation officer shall be granted permission to carry a firearm in the
        performance of his duties unless he has completed an approved firearms
         training program and has qualified thereunder to carry a firearm.
  III. 	A probation officer who has been granted permission to carry a firearm
         in the performanee of his duties shall use the same only in the exercise
         of his rights of self-defpnse in accordance with law.
   IV. A 	probation officer who discharges a firearm while in the performance
         of his duties shall file a report in writing witi] the chief probation officer
         within twenty-four (24) hours describing in detail the occasion on which,
         and the reason, he discharged the firearm.
    V. 	 The chief probation officer shall forthwith send copies of the report re­
         quired under paragraph IV to the chief judge and the Administrative
         Office.

                 RETIREMENT OF PROBATION OFFICERS

  The Conference was advised that Public Law 93-350, enacted
July 12, 1974, amends certain sections of the Civil Service Retire­
ment Act relating to law enforcement personnel. One amendment
which becomes effective Jauary 1, 1978, provides for the mandatory
                                       22 


retirement of a person eligible for immediate retirement on the last
day of the month on which he becomes 55 years of age, or if over
that age the last day of the month in which he completes 20 years
of service. There is an exception to the mandatory retirement
provision-when the head of an agency finds that in his judgment
the public interest requires an exemption of an employee from
automatic separation until the employee becomes 60 years of age.
For the purpose of implementing this law, the Conference adopted
the following resolution:
   The Director of the Administrative Office, when in his judgment and after re­
ceiving the findings and recommendation of the chief judge of the district finds
that the public interest so requires, may exempt a probation officer from separa­
tion until the probation officer becomes 60 years of age.

                      SPEEDY TRIAL ACT OF           1974
  Title II of the Speedy Trial Act provides that the Director of the
Administrative Office shall establish a pretrial services agency in ten
judicial districts. Five of these agencies will be administered by the
Division of Probation of the Administrative Office and the remain­
ing five by Boards of Trustees appointed by the chief judges of the
respective districts. The Conference assigned to the Committee on
the Administration of the Probation System oversight of the im­
plementation of Title II of the Speedy Trial Act, with reports to the
Conference as appropriate.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
             BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM
  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Bankruptcy System was presented by the Chairman, Judge Ed­
ward Weinfeld.

            SALARIES AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR REFEREES

  The Conference received the report of the Committee, together
with the recommendations of the Director of the Administrative
Office based on the November 1974 survey reports, as well as the
recommendations of the circuit councils and the district courts con­
cerned, for the continuation of 18 referee positions, for increase in
jurisdiction of the full-time referee position in the Western District
of Missouri, and to increase to full-time service the part-time ref­
                                       23

                                 CASE FILINGS

   The Committee report noted that since March 1974 there has
been an unparalleled increase in the number of bankruptcy cases
filed. In the first six months of fiscal year 1975, there was an in­
crease of 33.2 percent over the same period of the prior fiscal year.
Projection of this increase would indicate filings totaling between
232,000 and 250,000 in fiscal year 1975. The previous high filing
                                 26 


year was 1967, in which 208,329 cases were filed. In October 1974, a
total of 22,132 cases was filed, which is an all-time record for any
one month since the start of the Referees' Salary System.
   The business bankruptcies filed in fiscal year 1974 totaled
20,746, which is a record number of these cases. This figure rep­
resents 10.9 percent of the total cases filed in fiscal year 1974.
Current trends during the first half of fiscal year 1975 show that
the proportion of business cases may increase to 12 percent of the
total.
             REFEREES' SALARY AND EXPENSE FUND

   In fiscal year 1974 it was reported that receipts to the Referees'
Salary and Expense Fund were slightly below fifteen million dol­
lars, which was a record high. The costs of the system were
approximately $20,500,000, resulting in a deficiency to the special
Fund of over five and a half million dollars. This is the ninth
straight year in which there has been a deficit, which is made up
by appropriations from the general funds of the Treasury. The
cumulative deficit is approximately eighteen million dollars.
   The Fund is now supporting approximately 73 percent of the
system's cost. The Conference on two occasions has taken the posi­
tion that increasing the percentage charges to be assessed against
estates would place an undue burden on debtors and bankrupt
estates.
                       CLERICAL PERSONNEL

   The Conference was advised that the significant increase in
bankruptcy cases filed in the past year has placed a severe strain
on the appropriations, the personnel and the equipment. In Oc­
tober 1974 the Bankruptcy Division was authorized to seek funds
for 34 additional permanent clerical positions. With the continued
rise in filings, however, the Conference now approved a request
for 100 additional temporary employees for the bankruptcy system.

                            GUIDELINES

  The Conference approved the elimination of Chapter XIII
Guidelines Numbers 2 and 3 as inconsistent with the Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure and as unnecessary inasmuch as they merely
establish a procedure to effectuate Guideline Number 1 which is
monitored by the Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Of­



                                      }

XIII Trust.ee.
   The Conference also approved the modification of Chapter XIII
Guideline Number 4 to conform to the Rules of Bankruptcy Pro­
cedure so as to place the responsibility for determining integral
commercial areas on the referee in bankruptcy rather than on the
district judge. The Conference was advised that it was the con­
sensus of the Committee that if the referees in multiple offices can­
not come to an agreement, the matter could then be decided by
the district court.
                           LEGISLATION

   The Conference reaffirmed its approval of four bankruptcy bills
which had been introduced in, but not enacted by, the 93rd Con­
gress. The only modification of substance in a bill previously ap­
proved by the Conference was an increase in the maximum amounts
of commissions allowable to receivers and trustees under Section
48 of the Bankruptcy Act.
   The four bills listed under their numbers in the 93rd Congress
are as follows:                                               .
   (1) H.R. 3489 was a bill to abolish the Referees' Salary and Ex­
pense Fund as a special fund in the Treasury of the United States
and to eliminate the criteria for establishing salaries of full-time
referees in bankruptcy. This bill would not eliminate the charges
against estates but would cause the payment of fees and charges
to be placed directly in the general funds of the United States
Treasury and thus eliminate additional bookkeeping required in
maintaining a separate account.
   (2) H.R. 3488 was a bill to increase the maximum amounts al­
lowable to receivers and trustees under Section 48 of the Bank­
ruptcy Act. The bill has been modified to permit a 30 percent
increase in compensation for receivers and trustees to reflect in­
flationary trends.
   (3) H.R. 3491 was a bill to increase the retirement annuity of
the referee in bankruptcy by increasing the amount of deductions
from the referee's salary from seven to ten percent and increasing
the basis for computing his annuity from the present rate of I1h
percent on the first five years of service, 1% percent on the next
five years of service and two percent on all years of service over
                                       28 

ten, times the average high three-year salary average, to 2V2 per­
cent of his average high three-year salary.
   (4) H.R. 3487 was a bill to increase the term of the referee in
bankruptcy from six to twelve years and to make retirement
mandatory at age 70, except that the referee who is in office when
he reaches age 70 may serve out the balance of his term.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
        FEDERAL MAGISTRATES SYSTEM
  Judge Charles M. Metzner, Chairman of the Committee on the
Administration of the Federal Magistrates System, presented the
report of the Committee.

                 CHANGES IN MAGISTRATES POSITIONS

  The Conference was advised that if the funds requested are ap­
propriated by the Congress for fiscal year 1976 there will be 130 full­
time magistrate positions, 336 part-time magistrate positions and
16 combination clerk/magistrate or referee/magistrate positions.
After consideration of the survey reports of the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Office, the views of the district courts and circuit
councils concerned, the Committee recommended and the Confer­
ence approved changes, to be effective when appropriated funds are
available, which would increase the number of full-time positions to
133, the part-time positions to 337 and the combination positions to
17. The recommendations as approved by the Conference are:

         action.
                        JURISDICTIONAL CHECKLIST

   The Conference waS advised that in the view of the Committee
many courts are reluctant to utilize fully the services of their mag­
istrates in light of the uncertainty caused by an imperfect statute
and conflicting judicial decisions interpreting it. The Conference
agreed that expanded use of magistrates should be encouraged
and, accordingly, approved the distribution of a jurisdictional
checklist calling attention to those duties which may be delegated
to magistrates under existing law. The document is intended to
highligh t those areas in which magistrates can be most helpful
in relieving the growing burdens carried by.district judges and also
suggests some guidelines concerning the appropriate method by
which a judge may assign duties to a magistrate.

                CHANGES IN ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

   The Conference approved the request of the Administrative
Office for changes to Section 2.6 of the regulations of the Director
governing the administration of the magistrates system.
   The current regulation carries over a vestige of the old com­
missioner system by requiring a magistrate personally to certify
all original and duplicate recordings and transcripts. The Admin­
istrative Office, based on comments received from numerous mag­
istrates and clerks of court, determined that this requirement
is impracticable since it requires a magistrate to certify tapes and
documents which he has not personally prepared. Accordingly,
the Conference approved the following revised section 2.6, Record
of Proceedings.
   (a) Retention 01 Records. Original recordings and ribbon copies of transcripts
shall become part of a magistrate's record of proceedings in a case and shall
be transferred to the control of the clerk of the district court at the conclu­
sion of all proceedings before the magistrate, together with all other records
in the case. At the request of the clerk of the court, however, a full-time mag­
istrate may retain physical possession of original recordings in his office for
the clerk.
                                       31 

  (b) Oertification of Recorain(J8.
     0) Original recordings of proceedings held before a full-time magistrate
  need not be certified so long as such recordings remain at all times under the
  control of the full-time magistrate or the clerk of the district court. 'Where
  necessary for eyidentiary purpose~, original and duplicate recordings of pro­
  ceedings held before a full-time magist'"ate may be certified by the magistrate,
  by a member of the staff of the full· time magistrate, or by a deputy clerk of
  the district court.
     (ii) Original and duplicate recordings of proceedings held before a part­
  time magistrate shall be certified by the part-time magistrate. Where, however,
  such recordings are prepared by a deputy clerk of the district court, they may
  be certified by that depnty clerk.
   (c) Oertification Of Transcripts. Ribbon copies and duplicate copies of tran­
scripts of proceedings held before a full·time or a part-time magistrate shall be
certified as accurate by the person preparing such transcripts.

       STANDARD SALARY LEVELS FOR             PART-TIME MAGISTRATES
  The Conference approved 15 standard salary levels for part­
time magistrates and directed that all recommendations for changes
in part-time magistrate salaries in the future be made to one of
these levels. These st.andard salary levels as developed by the
Administrative Office for part-time magistrates range from a min­
imum of $369 to the statutory maximum of $15,000, as follows:
             $369                     $3,165                     $7,597
              633                      3, 798                     8,969
            1,266                      4,431                     10,552
            1,899                      5,276                     13,295
            2,532                      6,331                     15,000
   Effective upon the availability of appropriated funds for the
fiscal year beginning this July 1st, the salaries of 215 of 343 author­
ized positions, or 63 percent, will be payable at one of the fifteen
proposed standard levels. The remaining 37 percent of the part­
time magistrate positions not in standard levels on July 1st will
in time be overtaken by the standard levels through the process
of applying the annual government-wide cost-of-living increases
only to those positions at standard levels.
                                 LEGISLATION

   (1) Jurisdiction: The Conference approved a proposed draft bill
and directed the Administrative Office to transmit it to the Con­
gress to clarify the present jurisdictional provisions of the Federal
Magistrates Act. At present a wide diversity of views has developed
among the courts of appeals as to the appropriate scope of duties
which may be delegated to magistrates. The dissenting opinion of
                                 32 

the Chief Justice in Wingo v. Wedding, 418 U.S. 461 (1974), pointed
out the urgent need for the Congress to clarify the jurisdictional
provision of the Act. This need has now been further emphasized
by the passage of the Speedy Trial Act which will require the
district courts to make even greater use of their magistrates. The
draft bill would authorize a district judge to designate a United
States magistrate to hear any pretrial matter pending before the
court. The magistrate would also be empowered to conduct eviden­
tiary hearings in prisoner petition cases and to make recommenda­
tions to a district judge for the disposition of such cases. Further,
the amendment would provide the litigants an opportunity, of
right, to appeal a magistrate's findings, conclusions or rulings to a
district judge. The bill would broaden the authorization for a
magistrate to serve as a special master, to try the issues of a civil
case where the parties consent to the reference.
   (2) The Conference approved· the recommendation for a draft
bill to eliminate the requirement now found in subsection 3401 (b)
of Title 18, United States Code, that a defendant in a federal petty
offense case execute a written waiver of his right to be tried by a
district judge and consent to be tried before a United States Magis­
trate. It was the view of the Conference, in light of the fact that
United States magistrates in 1974 disposed of 71,000 petty offense
cases, that the present requirement of a written consent creates an
administrative burden for the magistrate and needlessly places him
in a delicate and awkward position. The proposal does not affect
misdemeanors other than petty offenses, nor does it restrict any
right that a defendant may have to a trial before a jury.
   (3) The Conference noted that H.R. 14535, 93rd Congress, which
the Conference had previously approved, has been resubmitted to
the 94th Congress. The bill would expand the trial jurisdiction of
magistra.tes to include misdemeanors punishable by fines of up to
$5,000, exempt petty offenses from the application of the Juvenile
Delinquency Act, specifically authorize magistrates to place a
defendant on probation prior to trial or acceptance of a plea of
guilty or nolo contendere in a minor offense case, authorize pay­
ment of transcript costs for indigent parties in certain civil cases,
eliminate the 50-day minimum period before determinations of the
Judicial Conference becomf> effective and specifically authorize the
combination of full-time magistrate and bankruptcy judge
positions.

    COMMITTEE         O~   INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  The report of the Committee on Intercircuit Assignments was
presented by the Chairman, Judge Roy W. Harper.
   The report covered the period from August 15, 1974 to Febru­
ary 1, 1975. During this period the Committee recommended 80
assignments to be undertaken by 53 judges. Of this number 12 are
senior circuit judges, four are active circuit judges, 19 are senior
district judges and 11 are district judges in active status. One retired
S'upreme Court Justice and one senior judge of the Court of Claims
participated in six assignments. Fifteen assignments involved three
active judges from the Court of Claims, one active judge from the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and one active judge of
the Customs Court.
                             GUIDELINES

   The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to compile guidelines which have been issued from time to
time to assist judges in intercircuit assignments and to issue this
compilation of guidelines to all federal judges. The Committee had
advised the Conference that many judges, particularly more
recently appointed judges, have not been familiar with the guide­
lines and have sometimes entered into assignments in which the
C-ommittee has been unable to concur.
     COMMITTEE TO           IMPLEME~T THE CRIMINAL 

                           JUSTICE ACT 

  Judge Dudley B. BonsaI, Chairman of the Committee to Im­
plement the Criminal Justice Act, presented the report of the
Committee to the Conference.

                   ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to disseminate to the chief judges of all United States dis­
trict courts and to all defender organizations the report of the
Administrative Office on appointments and payments made dur­
ing the first half of fiscal year 1975. This report showed that
private attorneys were appointed t-o represent 11,861 persons as
compared with 12,018 in the first half of fiscal year 1974. Defender
organizations were assigned 6,684 cases as compared with 5,391 in
                                       34 

the previous year. Since the last session of the Conference fed­
eral public defender organizations have become operational in the
Eastern District of Louisiana, the Western District of Pennsyl­
vania and the Southern District of Texas.
   The Administrative Office report showed that in the first half of
fiscal year 1975, 18,545 persons were represented, an increase of
6.5 percent over the same period of the previous year. It was pointed
out that this increase in appointments is consistent with the in­
crease in'      number of criminal cases docketed in the district
courts.
   The Congress appropriated $15,700,000 for implementation of
the Criminal Justice Act for fiscal year 1975 and a supplemental
appropriation request of $126,000 for mandatory pay increases has                     r

been requested. Inasmuch as commencing October I, 1976, the
federal fiscal year for budgetary purposes will commence on Oc­
tober 1 and end on September 30, the Conference approved for
the three-month transition period, July 1 through September 30,
1976, a continuing appropriation for defender organizations at the
rates approved for fiscal year 1976, or a total of $16,551,000, ad­
justed to the extent of pay costs resulting from general salary
increases.
               COMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS

  Upon recommendation of the Committee and the comment of
the Administrative Office, the Conference approved sustaining
grants to community defender organizations to cover operating
expenses during the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1975, as follows:
Federal Public Defender Program, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia ____________       $130,000
Federal Defender Program. Inc., Chicago, Illinois ____________________      272.000
Federal Defender's Office, DetrOit, MichigaIL_______________________        335,000

Federal Defender Section of the :\fetropolitan Public Defender Services,
  Inc., Portland, Oregon___________________________________________        105,000
Federal Court Division of the Defender Association of Philadelphia__       250,000

              SALARIES OF FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS

  The Conference agreed to rescind the action taken at the
March 1971 session setting the salary of a federal public defender
at approximately 85 percent of the salary of the United States
Attorney in the same district and in its place adopted the statu­
tory language which provides that the compensation of the fed­
                                  35 

eral public defender shall be fixed by the judicial council of the
circuit, at a rate not to exceed the compensation of the United
States Attorney for the district where representation is furnished.
In so doing, the Conference agreed that judicial councils, in fixing
the salaries of federal public defenders, should consider the rela­
tive responsibilities, size of staff and caseloads of the public de­
fender and the United States Attorney, as well as the scale of
salaries in the respective offices of the United States Attorneys, and
that in any case the salary of the federal public defender shall not
exceed the level at which federal executive salaries are currently
frozen as long as the present restrictions remain on executive
salaries.

      COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                  PROCEDURE 

  The report of the standing Committee on the Rules of Practice
and Procedure was presen ted by the Chairm.an, Judge Rciszel C.
Thomsen.
                          CRIMINAL RULEs

   As the Conference was advised at its September 1974 session
(Conf. Rept., p. 61) Public Law 93-361 postponed the effective date
of the amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
approved by the Conference at the October 1972 session and by the
Supreme Court on April 22, 1974, to August 1, 1975. Representa­
tives of the Advisory CommittBe and of the standing Committee
have restified before the committee of the Congress studying these
rules and are expected to have further opportunity to do so before
the hearings are concluded.
   Judge Thomsen advised the Conference that the Advisory Com­
mittee is already studying the revised version of S. 1, now intro­
duced in the 94th Congress, which contains many amendments to
the rules of criminal procedure, as well as a rewrite of Title 18 of the
Code. He said that the Advisory Committee is working in close col­
laboration with the Conference Committee on the Administration
of the Criminal Law in connection with this proposed legislation.

                        BANKRUPTCY RULES

  Pursuant to the Conference action at the September 1974 session
(Conf. Rept., p. 60) the DroDOsed rules under ChaDter X and
                                 36 


Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Act have been submitted to the
Supreme Court where they were under consideration at the time of
the Conference.
   Proposed rules under Chapter IX (Composition of Indebtedness
of Certain Taxing Agencies) have been circulated to the bench and
bar and comments are now under consideration by the Advisory
Committee. The remaining rules which are under Chapter VIII
(Railroad Reorganizations) have been readied for circulation to the
bench and bar in the spring of 1975.

                       RULES OF EVIDENCE

   The Federal Rules of Evidence, enacted by the Congress as Pub­
lic Law 93-595, approved January 2, 1975, become effective at the
beginning of July 1975.
   Judge Thomsen advised the Conference that substantial changes
were made in 17 rules and a number of rules were deleted entirely,
notably the rules dealing with privilege. He said that at the sugges­
tion of the Committee the Federal Judicial Center has engaged
Professor Edward W. Cleary who was the reporter for the former
Advisory Committee on the Rules of Evidence to prepare a docu­
ment containing the appropriate notes of the Advisory Committee,
as well as the materials from the Congressional committee hearings
and statements on the floor of the Congress, which will be helpful to
judges and lawyers in the interpretation of the Rules of Evidence.
Distribution of Professor Cleary's document is expected to be
achieved prior to the effective date of Public Law 93-595.

                       SPECIAL REPORT
  Chief Judge Harry Phillips of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
advised the Conference that with the death in February 1975 of
Judge Mac Swinford the roving judgeship to cover the Eastern and
Western Districts of Kentucky had become vacant. He recom­
mended to the Conference that, consistent with the policy of the
Conference to eliminate roving judgeships wherever appropriate,
legislation be proposed to the Congress to eliminate the roving
judgeship and that the roving judgeship heretofore provided for the
Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky be made a judgeship for
the Eastern District of Kentucky only.
                                 37 

  The Conference noted that this would tend in some measure to
equalize the workload of the two Kentucky districts and in approv­
ing the proposal directed the Administrative Office to transmit it to
the Congress.

        PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS 

                   OF APPEALS 

  The Conference approved the pretermission of terms of courts of
appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, for the June 1975 session of the
Fourth Circuit at Asheville, North Carolina, as well as all sessions
of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to be held outside of
New Orleans, Louisiana, and for all sessions of court of the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals to be held at Kansas City, Missouri, and
Omaha, Nebraska, for the balance of 1975.

           RELEASE OF CONFERENCE J. f"TION
  The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action on
matters considered at this session where necessary for legislative or
administrative action.
