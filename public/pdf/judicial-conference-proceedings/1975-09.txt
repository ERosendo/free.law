REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
   The Director of the Administrative Office, Mr. Rowland F.
Kirks. presented to the Conference his annual report on the activ­
ities of the administration and the state of business of the courts
for the year ending June 30, 1975.
   "On designation of the Chief Justice, Judge Delmas C. Hlll attended the Conference
In place of Chief Judge Lewis.
                                  43 

   The Conference authorized the Director to release immediately
 the preliminary edition in mimeographed form and to revise and
supplement the final printed edition.
   Mr. Kirks reported that there was a continued upward spiral
in the ca...;;eloads .of the United States courts of appeals and the
United States district courts during fiscal year 1975.
   Civil cases filed in the United States district c.ourts increased
13 percent and criminal filings increased nine percent despite a
sharp decline in prosecutions from violations .of the Selective Serv­
ice Act. Bankruptcy cases increased 34 percent to an all-time high
of 254,484. Q:msumer or non-business bankruptcy cases accounted
for 88 percent of the total filings whereas business bankruptcy cases
totaled 30,130, an all-time high.
   The 15-year upward trend in appeals c.ontinued through 1975
but slowed appreciatively. The 16,658 appeals docketed were only
1.4 percent above the prior year.
   Case dispositions continued to rise in all types of cases. Civil
case terminations were up seven percent, criminal case terminations
five percent, bankruptcy terminations eight percent and appeals
disposed .of in the courts.of appeals were up four percent.
   The report showed a nine percent increase in persons received f.or
probation by the United States probation service. United States
magistrates handled and disposed of 255,061 separate items of
judicial business, including the trial and disposition of 84,505 minor
offense cases.

                       COMMITI'EE ON THE BUDGET
   The report of the Committee on the Budget was presented by
Judge Carl A. Weinman, Chairman.
   The committee report showed that during 1975 a total of
$304,159,000 was appropriated for the federal judiciary through the
original and supplemental appropriation acts. The actual cost of
operations was $283,354,017. Excluding the funds for speedy trial
planning and pre-trial service agencies which are available until
expended, the sum of approximately eight million dollars is to be
returned to the Treasury. More than one-half of this amount is
from the appropriation for space and facilities due to the fact that
the General Services Administration reduced the standard level
user charges f.or space occupied by the courts as a result of a review
and reclassification of such space:
   The budget estimates submitted to the Congress for fiscal year


  598-139 0 - 76 - 2
                                 44 


1976, exclusive of the Supreme Court, initially were in the amount
of $334,252,000. The budget was subsequently amended to include
a request for three million to finance the observance of the Bi­
centennial of the American Revolution by the judiciary and subse­
quent additional sums were sought for additional magistrates and
for temporary clerks to cope with the heavy increase in bankruptcy
case filings. At the time of the Conference the 1976 appropriations
bill was still before the Congress. It was noted, however, that the
House of Representatives had once again denied funds for the
conversion of crier-law clerks to second law clerks for district
judges. The additional funds requested for longevity and meri­
torious increases in court report.ers' salaries were also denied.
  The pending appropriation bill also contains the appropriation
for the transition period of July 1 to September 30, 1976 since
the new fiscal year, pursuant to Public Law 93-344, will com­
mence on October 1,1976.
  The Conference next considered the budget request to be sub­
mitted for fiscal year 1977 which takes into account the recom­
mendations of the committees of the Conference as well as the
cost-of-living increase as approved by the President.

                  FEES OF LAND COMMISSIONERS

  On recommendation of the Budget Committee the Conference
agreed that the request for funds for the payment of fees and
expenses of land commissioners should continue to be made by
the Department of Justice until such time as the Conference re­
ceives and has an opportunity to study the recommendations to
be made by the Committee on Court Administration as a result
of its current study to determine whether the fees and expenses
of land commissioners can be borne by the condemning agency.

              SALARIES OF SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

   The Conference authorized a change in the text of the appropria­
tion for salaries of supporting personnel to provide for the payment
of post differentials and allowances for secretaries and law clerks
to judges outside the continental United States and in Alaska,
without regard to the limitations on the aggregate salaries of such
secretaries and law clerks.

                   U NDER-UTILIZED FACILITIES

   The Conference also authorized the Director of the Administra­
tive Office to furnish to the Appropriations Committee an updated
                                 45 

inventory of under-utilized facilities. The Director was further re­
quested to inform the committees of the Congress that abolishing
excess courtrooms is properly a matter within the jurisdiction of
the Congress.
                 COURT ADMINISTRATION
  Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr., Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on Court Administration.

                JUDICIAL SURVIVORS A~NUITY      Am
  Judge Ainsworth reported to the Conference that in June the
Senate Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery re­
ported out a bill (S. 12) containing many of the amendments to
the Judicial Survivors Annuity Act previously proposed by the
Judicial Conference, together with certain additional amendments.
The Committee on Court Administration, at its meeting in early
July, endorsed this bill, as amended, and because the Director of
the Administrative Office was about to testify before the subcom­
mittee, the committee requested the approval of the Executive
Committee of the Conference. The Executive Committee approved
the text and Mr. Kirks so informed the Senate subcommittee.
Since that time certain additional amendments along the lines re­
quested by the Conference have been made and a revised Commit­
tee Print was presented to the Conference. The Conference agreed
to ratify the action taken in July by its Executive Committee and
endorsed the further amendments incorporated in the text pre­
sented to it.
                    SERVICE OF SE~IOR JUDGES

   At the request of the chief judge of one circuit, the committee
undertook a review of its 1950 resolution (Conf. Rept., p. 21) which
provided for personnel, office space and equipment for retired
judges upon a determination by the judicial council of the respec­
tive circuits as to whether such retired judges were performing
"substantial service to the judiciary." The committee was requested
to develop minimum standards to assist the judicial councils in
making such determinations. The committee, however, decided
that it was not possible to devise a meaningful formula whereby
the service to the judiciary of a n~tired judge could be measured
with any mathematical nicety. TheCQmmittee noted that many
judges continue to sit in court with great'freq~ency after retirement
                                   46 


while others render valuable service to the judiciary bj serving as
masters by appointment of the Supreme Court, by service on Ju­
dicial Conference committees, and the like. The Conference ex­
pressed agreement with this point of view and reaffirmed its 1950
resolution.

             STATISTICS ON FuGITIVE CRIMINAL CASES

  At the September 1974 session (Conf. Rept. p. 49) the Confer­
ence approved a recommendation of the committee to standardize
procedures to provide a better means of managing the active docket
and of compiling statistics that accurately reflect a court's work
while meeting the requirements of Rule 5O(b) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure. Because the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 now
prescribes a different method of accounting for all defendants, the
Conference agreed to rescind the action taken at the September
1974 meeting so that the Administrative Office of the Courts may
comply with the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act.

                ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW DISTRIaI'S

   At the October 1972 session of the Judicial Conference (Conf.
Rept., p. 33) the Conference approved a policy position regarding
places of holding court to provide tha,t when a Congressional or
other request is received relating to the establishment of an addi­
tional place of holding court, and before referral to a committee of
the Conference, the Administrative Office shall first seek the views
of the chief judge of the district involved and the judicial council
of the circuit as to the merits of the proposaL Only after the pro­
posal meets with the approval of both and supporting data are
provided shall the proposal be referred to a Conference committee.
The Conference approved the recommendation that this policy be
expanded to include proposals for the establishment of new dis­
tricts or new divisions within existing districts.

                      SUPPORTING PERSONNEL

Clerk's Offices-Courts of Appeals
  The Conference approved the recommendation that the Director
of the Administrative Office be authorized to include in the fiscal
year 1977 budget a sufficient number of deputy clerks for the courts
of appeals to achieve a ratio of deputy clerks to the filings projected
of 1 :75.
                                  47 

Clerks' Offices-District Courts
   The Conference also agreed that the Director of the Administra­
tive Office be authorized to include in the 1977 budget a sufficient
number of deputy clerks to achieve a ratio of deputy clerks to the
civil and criminal filings projected for the district courts of 1: 100,
plus "filing equivalence for bankruptcy cases, naturalization peti­
tions, violation notices and other functions."
Probation Officers
  The Conference agreed that the fiscal year 1977 requirements
for probation officers and clerk-stenographers be the total of the
unfulfilled requests for fiscal year 1976 and the new requirements
for fiscal year 1977 as established by the Budget Committee.
Miscellaneous Positions-Courts of Appeals
  The Conference approved the following additional positions in
the courts of appeals:
Circuit:                                   Positions
    Second ................ .       1 court law clerk
    Third ................. .       1 court law clerk
                                    1 court (pool) secretary 

     Fourth ................ .      1 library assistant 

     Sixth ................. .      1 court law clerk 

     Seventh ............... .      2 court law clerks 

     Eighth ................ .      1 library assistant 

     Tenth ................. .      2 court law clerks, 

                                    1 library assistant
Court Reporters' Transcript Rates
   The Conference approved, effective November 1, 1975, charges
for original transcripts (ordinary delivery) of $1.50 per page, with
the first copy to cost $.50 per page and the remaining copies $.25
per page; with respect to daily copy the original and first copy are
to remain at $2.50 and $.50 per page, respectively, and the remaining
copies $.25 per page. This approval goes to government and private
suits.
Clerical Assistants to Full-Time United States MCl{fistrates
   With respect to full-time United States magistrates, the Confer­
ence approved for the position of clerical assistant who is primarily
responsible for the magistrate's courtroom function, and when that
function consumes a preponderant portion of the clerical assistant's
                                 48 

time, an additional grade (JSP 7) to be added to the authorized
grade range (JSP 4-5-6) and tha.t the position be entitled "Court­
room Assistant." The Director of the Administrative Office was re­
quested to draft suitable standards of qualifications for this
position.
Policy on Assignment of Court Reporters
   Chief Judge Seitz advised the Conference that the judges of the
Third Circuit had unanimously passed a resolution expressing ex­
treme concern at the lack of sufficient court reporters to permit the
active judges to try more cases because their reporters need out-of­
court time to dictate their notes and to permit the senior district
judges to try more cases. The consequence is a growing and serious
delay in the trial of cases and in making the transcripts available
for appeal purposes. This is particularly serious in criminal cases.
   At the direction of his Third Circuit Conference, Judge Seitz
moved and the Conference agreed that the basic policy of one re­
porter for each active judge established in April 1944 be reexamined
in the light of the current needs of the active and senior judges. The
Chief Justice was authorized to refer this subject to the appropriate
Conference committee for an in-depth examination and report to
the Conference.

               SALARIES OF UNGRADED EMPLOYEES

   At the October 1971 Conference (Conf. Rept. p. 65) the Con­
ference approved the report of its Committee on Salaries for un­
graded court officers. Included was a provision relating to circuit
court executives, full-time referees in bankruptcy, full-time United
States magistrates and clerks of court. Noting that for the first
time since the approval of this report a cost-of-living increase has
been authorized by the President and the Congress for federal
judges, the Conference auf.horized the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office that at such time as any increase in the salaries of
federal judges becomes effective, he is to grant increases to the
clerks of court and such other ungraded court officers as may be
affected whose salaries are controlled by the adoption of the Sal­
ary Committee's report in October 1971, retaining the same per­
centage maximum limitation as prescribed in that report. The
Conference also requested the committee to study further the
maximum limitations imposed on salaries of clerks of court and
report to the next session of the Conference.
                                 49
                            LEGISLATION

  (1) The Conference reendorsed its approval of S. 1175, 93rd
Congress, relating to the furnishing of accommodations to the
 judges of the courts of appeals and it requested the Director of
 the Administrative Office to transmit such legislative proposal
to the 94th Congress.
   (2) The Conference disapproved S. 932 designed to increase the
retirement benefits accruing to certain territorial judges for their
services as territorial judges in prior years. The Conference was
of the view that the bill as framed would apply to only one ter­
ritorial judge now living and, therefore, if the Congress desired
 to enact such legislation, it would better be accomplished by a
private bill.
   (3) The Conference considered H.R. 4580, a bilI to provide for
the reorganization of the judicial system of Guam, and agreed that
the proposal was basically one involving legislative policy. The
Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative Office,
however, to transmit to the Congress the views expressed on the
proposal, at the request of the Committee on Court Administra­
tion, by Judge Cristobal C. Duenas of Guam. The Conference also
requested the Director to make known to the Congress its view
that consideration should be given to the potential substantial
drain on the caseload of the district court of Guam and also in the
event the bill is passed that Section 23(c)(1) be amended to make
it clear that the district court of Guam will have general diversity
jurisdiction as well as the federal question jurisdiction. The Con­
ference also agreed that the Congress be requested to consider
whether jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Supreme Court
of Guam should be given to the Supreme Court of the United
States under its certiorari jurisdiction or to the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit under its appellate jurisdiction or by
certiorari.
   (4) The Conference disapproved H.R. 1279, a bill to provide
for the garnishment of wages of federal employees.
   (5) The Conference agreed that it was not within its purview
to express any views on H. J. Res. 3 providing for the joint election
of the President and the Vice President.
   (6) The Conference agreed to express no views on S. 642, a hill
which would amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to author­
ize certain state and local officials to enforce certain rules pro­
mulgated by the Commission.
                                 50 

   (7) The Conference disapproved in its present form S. 670, a
bill to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce,
including unfair consumer practices. The Conference agreed that
the Congress should be advised that this legislation would alter
the fundamental character of the federal courts as courts of lim­
ited jurisdiction and that the Conference does not regard the
United States district courts as the proper forum for action under
such legislation.
   (8) The Conference voted to reiterate its position on R.ll. 673,
a bill to extend protection against fraudulent and deceptive prac­
tices to consumers through civil and class actions. The Conference
agreed to request the Congress to consider other procedural devices
to achieve the objectives of the legislation inasmuch as this bill, if
enacted, would alter the fundamental character of the federa1
courts as courts of limited jurisdiction.
   (9) The conference took no position with respect to R.ll. 1044
relating to the marketing of petroleum products but did request
that the Congress be advised that the Conference sees no need to
repeat the venue provisions of 28 U.S.c. 391 in the bilL
   (10) The Conference agreed that the proposal contained in
R.R. 612, a bill to provide for protection of franchised dealers in
petroleum products, involved a matter of legislative policy but
agreed that the Congress should be advised that the provision in
Section 2(b)(3) in the bill should be stricken since the venue is
already covered by Section 1391 of Title 28 U.S.C.
   (11) The Conference agreed that R.ll. 39, a bill to increase the
effectiveness of discovery in civil antitrust investigations, involved
a matter of legislative policy on which the Conference should not
properly comment.
   (12) The Conference agreed that R.ll. 1043, a bill to regulate
and prevent multiple taxation of certain kinds of income, involved
a matter of legislative policy.
   (13) The Conference took no position on the policy involved in
H.R. 1272 and S. 354 relating to no-fault motor vehicle insurance.
   (14) The Conference agreed that the draft of the Department
of Justice relating to the reform of the Robinson-Patman Act in
regard to price discrimination and predatory pricing involved a
question of legislative policy.
   (15) With respect to H.R. 1330, a bill which would require fed­
eral employees to file statements with regard to the receipt of
certain gifts, the Conference agreed that the substance of the bill
                                             51 

involves a policy matter but that as far as the judicial establish­
ment was concerned, in view of the existing ethical standards and
conflict of interest statutes, the bill would add little to
improve the judicial establishment and would impose significant
burdens upon employees.

                            REVIEW COMMITTEE
   The report of the Review Committee was presented by its Chair­
man, Judge Edward A. Tamm.
   The committee report advised that it is of the view that judicial
council approval should no longer be required of judges serving
in fiduciary capacities in family estates and, accordingly, recom­
mended and the Conference approved a resolution to eliminate the
necessity for judges or other judicial officers having to obtain judi­
cial council approval for service as fiduciaries in estates or trusts
which are of a family nature and within the third degree of re­
lationship as calculated according to the civil law system. After
approving the recommendation in principle it was returned for
further study of the meaning of Itfamily related." The Conference
also agreed in view of the limitation contained in 28 U.S.C. 455
to eliminate from the semi-annual report form Section IV en­
titled "Participation in Cases."
   Judge Tamm pointed out that a number of judicial officers were
late in filing their reports. He stated that the judicial officers who
had not filed reports of extrajudicial income for the period Janu­
ary 1 through June 30, 1975 are:
  Listing, by Circuit, of Judicial Officers who have not filed reports of extra­
judicial income for the period January I-June 30, 1975.

  The foregoing is set forth pursuant to the resolution of the
Judicial Conference at its March 1971 session (Conf. Rept., p. 24),
as subsequently amended to include full-time bankruptcy judges
and magistrates.

   JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE CODE OF JUDICIAL
                             CONDUCT
  The report of the Joint Committee on the Code of Judicial Con­
duct of which Judges Elbert P. Tuttle and Edward A. Tamm are
co-chairmen was presented to the Conference by Judge Tamm.

                             LEGISLATION

   The committee reported that the House Judiciary Committee
had requested the Conference's views on H.R. 110 and H.R. 3249,
bills which would require every officer and employee of the federal
government who earns more than $18,000 per annum (H.R. 110)
or $25,000 (H.R. 3249) to file annual reports of income and financial
transactions with the Comptroller General as well as toO report the
amount and source of gifts received, the identity of each asset hav­
ing a value in excess of $1,000, each liability in excess of $1,000,
transactions in securities and commodities and any purchase and
sale of real property. Similar information would 'be required con­
cerning the spouse and members of the immediate family. The
Conference agreed with the committee that the provisions of these
bills insofar as they affect judicial officers are neither necessary nor
desirable since the federal judiciary has already adopted its own
reporting system.

            DISQUALIFICATION OF BANKRUPl'CY JUDGES

   In adopting the Code of Judicial Conduct for United States
Judges and making it applicable to full-time bankruptcy judges
in 1973, the Conference expressed the view that bankruptcy judges
should not be required by any provisions of the Code to disqualify
themselves because of any financial interest in any uncontested
matter (Conf. Rept., April 1973, p. 10). Recently the Congress
has amended Section 455 of Title 28, United States Code, to pro­
vide that any justice, judge, magistrate or referee in bankruptcy
must disqualify himself if he knows that he or a member of his
household has a financial interest in the subject matter of the con­
troversy. The Conference was in agreement with the committee ree­
                                 53 


ommendation that the language of this revised statute nullifies the
action of the Conference in 1973 even as to full-time or part-time
referees in bankruptcy who have any financial interest in any un­
contested matter. The Committee on the Administration of the
Bankruptcy System was authorized to consider any amendment to
Section 455 that may seem desirable.

                 AorIVITIES OF THE CoMMITI'EES

  The Conference approved the recommendation that the commit­
tee prepare for the members of the federal judiciary a document
in the nature of an overview of the origin and work of the Review
Committee, the Joint Committee and the Advisory Committee on
Judicial Activities, the problems encountered, actions taken and
the institutional questions which must yet be resolved.

                  ALLEGATIONS OF IRREGULARITY

  The Conference agreed that the committee through its co-chair­
men be authorized to refer to the chief judge of the appropriate cir­
cuit for consideration by the circuit council any communication
received by the committee alleging an irregularity by a judge.

  ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES
   Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman, reported to the Conference
on the activities of the Advisory Committee on JudicialActivities.
   Judge Tuttle stated that in the last six months twenty formal in­
quiries were presented for consideration and that to date the com­
mittee has considered and acted upon 81 formal submissioris. Three
formal opinions have been issued since the last report to the Con­
ference, namely, Opinion No. 43 relating to service by a judge as a
statutory member of a citizen supervisory commission of the per­
sonnel board of the county of his residence; Opinion No. 44­
trustee of a state supported college or university and Opinion No.
45-disqualification in litigation involving health insurance com­
panies underwriting government group health plans of which the
judges are members.

   COMMITTEE ON TIlE OPERATION OF THE JURY
                            SYSTEM
  Judge Arthur J. Stanley, Chairman, presented the report of the
Commi ttee on the Operation of the Jury System.
                                 54 

                    TRANSPORTATION OF JURORS
   The committee pointed out that under the provisions of 28
U.S.C. 1871 payment of travel costs to jurors is at the rate of ten
cents a mile, plus the amount expended for tolls, whereas in urban
areas the fare for public transportation normally exceeds this rate
on a per mile basis. The committee recommended and the Con­
ference approved a draft bill and authorized its transmittal to the
Congress to provide that jurors receive the actual fare in its en­
tirety for public transport.ation to and from the federal courts
for each day of jury service. The Conference further approved
that the bill authorize the clerk of court to arrange transportation
at public expense when jurors are required to leave the courthouse
after deliberation beyond the normal business closing hours. At
the present time there is no authority for the arrangement of safe
and prompt transportation for jurors in these circumstances.

                   EXCUSE FROM JURY SERVICE
   In hearings on legislation proposed by the Conference to provide
a civil penalty and injunctive relief for the discharge of an em­
ployee by reason of his federal jury service, it has been pointed out
 that in certain situations such legislation might have an unfair
impact when applied to the small business man who is faced with
the loss of a key or indispensable employee. In view of this con­
cern, the Conference approved a committee recommendation that
legislation be drafted to clarify the grounds for the temporary
excuse of summoned jurors from service under 28 U.S.c. 1866 (c)
 (1), which provides that courts may excuse persons upon a show­
ing of undue hardship or extreme inconvenience. The draft bill
would add a new definitional subsection to Section 1869 of Title
28 to establish severe economic hardship to an employer stem­
ming from the summoning of a key employee to jury duty as a
basis for the employee's temporary excuse from service and to pro­
vide a statutory definition of "undue hardship or extreme incon­
venience" as applied to the prospective juror himself. The
Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative Office
to transmit this draft bill to the Congress.
                   FEDERAL CRIMINAL CoDE
  Because the pending bill in Congress (S. 1) to codify and revise
Title 18, United States Code, will have a major impact on the
                                55 

foundations of the criminal law upon which existing jury instruc­
tion manuals are based, the committee recommended that the
Chief Justice assign to a special committee of the Conference, or
to such committee as he deems appropriate, a study of pattern
jury instructions to reflect the changes in the criminal law which
would result from the proposed recodification.

             SPEEDY TRIAL ACT AND GRAND JURIES

  The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts to distribute to the chief judge
of each district court for guidance on the implementation of the
Speedy Trial Act a report prepared by a member of the committee
discussing the various options available to the courts for the sum­
moning of grand juries at sufficiently frequent intervals to achieve
eventual compliance with Section 3161 (b) of Title 18, United
States Code, and more immediate compliance with the graduated
interim time limitations between arrest and indictment which are
imposed by section 3161 (f).

                       PERIODIC REPORTING

  The Conference approved a committee recommendation request­
ing that the judicial councils of the circuits and the working jury
committees of the circuits review the sampling reports for their
districts relating to jury representative data by race and sex, and
take such action thereon as may be required to comply with the
randomness and nondiscrimination requirements of 28 U.S.c. 1861
and 1862, reporting such action to the Administrative Office.

         FUTURE SAMPLING OF MASTER JURY WHEELS                         ,,

   The Conference approved a form and data collection instructions
for the future reporting of jury sampling data by race and sex. The
committee suggested that this reporting system would be the most
t.horough and least burdensome method of obtaining data as to
the race and sex balance of juries serving in the district courts.

                 GRAND JURY STATISTICAL FORM

    The Conference approved a revised form for the reportingoy
the district courts of grand jury utilization data.
                                 56 

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                     CRIMINAL LAW
  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the
Criminal Law was presented by the Chairman, Judge Alfonso J.
Zirpoli.
            LEGISLATION REGARDING THE GRAND JURY

   The Committee reported that the Conference's views had been
requested on two bills pending in the Congress, H.R. 1277 and
H.R. 2986. These bills would effect radical changes in grand jury
practices and procedures permitting any grand jury to turn itself
into an independent grand jury operating independently of the
Department of Justice and would permit witnesses the right to
assistance of counsel while testifying before grand juries. The Con­
ference agreed with the committee recommendation in disapprov­
ing each of the two pending bills.

                     FEDERAL CRIMINAL CODE

   The views expressed on S. 1, as previously reported, reflected
opposition to this legislation on the ground that it contemplates
unnecessarily sweeping redefinition of all federal crimes and will
require, among other things, (a) that every district judge will be
required to restructure and formulate new jury instructions to re­
place those which have evolved on a literal Htrial and error" basis
for well over 100 years; (b) that new instructions for newly defined
crimes must then literally "run the gauntlet" of courts of appeals;
and (c) that ultimately the Supreme Court will be obliged to re­
view numerous cases to pass finally on the adequacy of the in­
stuctions required by the new code. In the present state of over­
crowded dockets at every level, the new and complex burdens
that S. 1 will impose on the federal courts are incalculable. The
Conference nevertheless continues to comply with congressional
requests for comments on specific parts of S. 1.
   The committee report to the Conference stated that CUlpability
is central to the entire legislative schema of the proposed new code.
The committee reported on the position that the Judicial Confer­
ence took at its April 1973 meeting on this subject (Conf. Rept.
p. 15) but suggested a minor modification of the definition of
"knowingly." The committee recommended and the Conference
approved that the following definitions of "culpability" be proposed
to the Congress:
                                        57
  "A person engages in conduct:
  "(1) 'knowingly' if, when he engages in the conduct, he does so voluntarily
and not by mistake, accident or other innocent reason, and with knowledge
of existing circumstances to the extent that such knowledge is an element of the
offense;
   "(2) 'intentionally' if, when he enl(al(es in the conduct, he does so knowingly
and with the purpose of doing that which the law prohibits or failing to do
that which the law requires;
  "( 3) 'recklessly' if, when he engages in conduct with respect to a material
element of an offense, he fails to be aware of a risk that the material
element of an offense, he disregards a risk of which he is aware that the material
element exists or will result from his conduct. His disregard of that
risk must involve a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reason­
sonable person would observe in the situation; except that awareness of the
risk is not required where its absence is due to voluntary intoxication;
   "( 4) 'negligently' if, when he engages in conduct with respect to a material
element of an offense, he fails to be aware of a risk that the material element
exists or will result from his conduct. His failure to perceive that risk must
involve a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person
would observe in the situation."
  In considering the provisions of S. 1 the Conference agreed that
Judge Zirpoli, as chairman of the Committee on the Administration
of the Criminal Law, should coordinate all of the activities
of the several committees of the Judicial Conference relating to the
proposed new criminal code and should appear before the Congress
whenever requested in connection with the view of the Conference
relating to S. 1.
    DENIAL OF THE RIGHT OF FORMER CRIMINAL OFFENDERS 

                                   To    VOTE 


   The views of the Conference were requested on H.R. 2386 which
would prohibit the denial or abridgement of the right of former
criminal offenders to vote in elections to federal office. The Con­
ference was agreed that the proposed bill does not directly affect
the administration of justice as it relates to the courts and is
primarily one of legislative policy regarding the voting rights of
citizens and, accordingly, the Conference agreed to express no
views on the policy question involved.

                        SPEEDY TRIAL
  Pursuant to Conference request, the committee reviewed and
approved guidelines to the administration of the Speedy Trial Act
prepared jointly by the Administrative Office and the Federal Judi­
cial Center. These guidelines undertook to state available tentative
advisory interpretations of the act so that the courts may have a
uniform approach to the gathering of statistics, the measuring of
time intervals and in carrying out other administrative duties. As
                                        58 


experience is gained in the administration of the act, the guidelines
may necessarily have to be revised or amended. They are designed,
Judge Zirpoli stated, to aid in achieving the optimum degree of
uniformity in the administration of the act.
   Judge Zirpoli advised that as to reporters, the Department of
Justice has interpreted the position to be affected by the conflict­
of-interest laws and the dual compensation laws. Accordingly,
the Administrative Office has proposed to the Congress legislation
which would provide that reporters are not government employees
and are not subject to conflict-of-interest legislation. The Confer­
ence endorsed this position and urged that enactment of such legis­
lation be regarded as a high priority matter.

REFERENCE OF NON-BANKRUPTCY RELATED MATI'ERS TO REFEREES

  Resolved, That United States district judges shall not appoint

States district courts of this Resolution.
                                 62
                           LEGISLATION

   The Conference strongly disapproved S. 582 which would amend
the Banhuptcy Act to fix the salaries of full-time referees by
statute at $36,000 per annum as not being consistent with the
alignment of salaries of court officials as determined by the Judi­
cial Conference at its October 1971 session (Conf. Rept. p. 65).
   The Conference approved H.R. 5951 which in addition to pro­
viding increased retirement benefits for referees would also re­
quire mandatory retirement at age seventy. Conference approval
was conditioned on the proviso that the bill be amended to in­
clude a provision for twelve-year tenure for referees in bank­
ruptcy.

        COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
             OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM
  Judge Albert C. Wollenberg, Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on the Administration of the Probation System.

                     SENTENCING INSTITUTE

   At the March 1975 session of the Conference (Conf. Rept., p.
20), the Conference approved the agenda for a sentencing institute
for the judges of tlie Ninth Circuit to be held at Long Beach,
California, in October or November 1975. The Sentencing Institute
has now been definitely set for November 12-14. On request of
the judges of the Sixth Circuit the Conference approved participa­
tion in the Sentencing Institute by the judges of that circuit.
                   SPEEDY TRIAL    Acr   OF   1974
    The Conference at the March 1975 session (Conf. Rept., p. 22)
instructed the Probation Committee to exercise oversight in the
implementation of Title II of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 which
I,rovides that the Director of the Administrative Office shall es­
tablish on a demonstration basis a pretrial services agency in
ten judicial districts; five to be administered by the Division of
Probation and five to be administered by boards of trustees ap­
pointed by the chief judges of each of the five districts.
    The five districts designated by the Chief Justice, in consulta­
t.ion with the Attorney General, to be administered by the Division
of Probation are the Central District of California, the Northern
District of Georgia, the Northern District of Illinois, the Southern
                                        63 

District of New York, and the Northern District of Texas; and
the five pretrial services agencies to be administered by boards
of trustees are the District of Maryland, the Eastern District of
Michigan, the Western District of Missouri, the Eastern District
of New York, and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
  The committee proposed and the Conference approved the fol­
lowing guidelines for implementation of Title II of the Speedy
Trial Act of 1974:
A. Salaries
  18 U.S.C. 3153 (d) (1) states that, "In each of the five demonstration districts in
which pretrial service agencies are established pursuant to subsection (a) of thi"
section, the pretrial service officer shall be a federal probation officer of the
district designated for this purpose by the Chief of the Division of Probation
and shall be compensated at a rab! not in excess of the rate prescribed for GS-16
by section 5332 of title 5, United States Code."
   18 U.S.C. 3153( d) (2) states that, "In each of the five remaining demonstration
districts il). which pretrial service agencies are established pursuant to sub­
section (b) (1) of this section, after reviewing the recommendations of the
judges of the district court to be served by the agency, each such Board of
Trusteees shall appoint a chief pretrial service officer, who shall be compen­
sated at a rate to be established by the chief judge of the court, but not in
excess of the rate prescribed for GS-I5 by section 5332 of Title 5, United States
Code."
  The committee recommended and the Conference approved the following
guidelines for the setting of salaries for a chief pretrial service officer:
    (1) 	In those districts where a cihef probation officer classified in grade
         JSP-I5 is designated chief pretrial service officer his salary shall be
         set at $36,000 per annum, plus any comparability salary increase.
    (2) 	In those districts where a chief probation officer classified in grade
         JSP-I4 is designated chief pretrial service officer his salary shall be
        set at grade JSP-15.
    (3) The 	salary of a chief pretrial service officer in a board of trustees
         administered agency shall be set no higher than one grade below the
         salary authorized by the Judiciary Salary Plan for the chief proba·
         tion officer of that district.
B. 	Qualifications for Appointment
  The committee recommended and the Conference estabUshed the following
minimum qualification requirements for initial appointment as a pretrial serv­
ice officer which are identical to those required by the Judiciary Salary Plan
for appointment as a probation officer.
     (1) 	For appointment at grade JSP-7 the appointee must possess a bachelor's
          degree.
     (2) 	For appointment at grade JSP-9 the appointee must possess a
          bachelor's degree and have not less than 2 years' related experience or
          a 2-year master's degree or a I-year master's degree and 1 year of
          related experience.
O. Boo1cgrouna I'MJe8tigation
  The Conference instructed the Director of the Administrative Office to ar·
range for a full·field investigation by thl! F.B.I. of the background of each
                                        64 

person selected as a pretrial service officer just as each person selected for ap­
pointment as a proiJation officer is the subject of a full background investigation
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (See Conf. Repts., Sept., 1968, pp. 68, 69
and April 1973. p. 24).
  The Conference further instructed the Director not to place on the payroll
any person appointed to the position of pretrial service officer until the F.B.I.
investigation was completed and the report of the inYestigation forwarded to
the appointing authority except when the Director determines that an emer­
gency situation requires immediate appOintment.
   The final report of the Director of the Administrative Office to
the Congress which is required on July I, 1979 must compare
the accomplishments of the two types of pretrial service agencies
as well as make a comparison with monetary bail or other pro­
grams used to insure presence at trial. The committee has endorsed
the evaluation design developed by the Probation Division
 to permit these comparisons.
   The committee reported that it has also considered the extent
to which supportive services should be made available to persons
 released pending trial, including those who are not released spe­
 cifically to the custody or supervision of a pretrial service agency.
The committee has concluded that the supportive services pro­
vided by pretrial service agencies shall be available on request to
 all persons released under Chapter 207 of Title 18, United States
Code.
                    REMOVAL OF PROBATION OFFICERS

   In view of recent litigation, the Probation Committee advised
the Conference that it believes there is a need for unifonn proce­
dures for the removal of a probation officer which would include as
a minimum a notice of removal, a hearing on request, and an ex­
planation of the basis for firutl action. The Chairman reported that
a special subcommittee has been appointed to develop appropriate
procedures and with Conference approval the committee will
coordinate with the Subcommittee on Supporting Personnel of the
Committee on Court Administration in view of the implications
of its recommendations to other court employees.

                          PROBATION PERSONNEL

  The Chairman reported that the committee has reviewed the
projection of probation personnel needs for fiscal year 1977 and has
recommended to the Budget Committee that the budget request
for fiscal year 1977 include funds for 379 probation officers, 234
clerk-stenographers, and 20 probation officer assistants.
                                 65
                    YOUTH CORRECTIONS ACT

   The committee reported that it has approved and transmitted for
consideration to the CDmmittee on the Administration of the Crim­
inal Law a proposed amendment to the Youth CDrrections Act
which would authorize a court to place a youth offender on proba­
tion or to commit him without entering a judgment of guilty. In the
event of an early termination of probation or the period of super­
vision following commitment, the proceedings against the defen­
dant would be dismissed without adjudication of guilt and all rec­
ords pertaining to the arrest, information or indictment, plea or
trial, finding of guilty, probation or commitment would be sealed.
Such discharge and dismissal would not be deemed a conviction for
the purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law
upon conviction of crime or for any other purpose. A further
amendment would allow the court to impose a fine or require pay­
ment of restitution as a condition of probation or as a condition of
commitment. Independent imposition of a fine would not be
authorized.
                     DRUG ABUSE PROGRAMS
  The committee advised that the Bureau of Prisons has found it
necessary to limit funds available for drug abuse programs for per­
sons participating in such programs as a condition for probation
or parole. The committee has previously endorsed in principle the
concept of providing supportive services to persons on probation or
parole through contract arrangements and the Congress has ex­
pressed policy in this area through Title II of the Speedy Trial Act
extending limited contract authority to the probation system for
drug treatment programs for persons on pretrial release. The com­
mittee has expressed concern that there is little assurance that a
person participating in a drug treatment program as a condition
of pretrial release could continue the treatment program once
placed on probation. It has instructed the Probation Division to
explore this problem further.

    COMMITI'EE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS
  The Chairman, Judge Roy W. Harper, presented the report of
the CDmmittee on Intercircuit Assignments, which covered the
period from February I, 1975 to August 15, 1975..
  During this period the CDmmittee recommended 88 assignments
to be undertaken by 57 judges. Of this number, 10 are senior cir­
cuit judges, two are active circuit judges, 13 are district judges
                                 66 

in active status and 18 are senior district judges. One retired
Supreme Court Justice participated in 11 assignments. Seven­
 teen assignments involved seven active judges from the Court
of Claims, five active judges from the Court of Customs and Patent
 Appeals and one active judge of the Customs Court. These included
an interchange of assignments between the seven active judges
of the Court of Claims and the five active judges of the Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals for the period April 2, 1975 through
April 1, 1976 to cover any emergency situations which might arise
in those courts.
   Ten senior circuit judges, seven senior district judges, one senior
Court of Claims judge and one retired Supreme Court Justice car­
ried out 32 of the 43 assignments to the circuit courts of appeals
which were recommended during this period. Of the 33 assignments
to the district courts, 12 senior district judges participated in 20
assignments, the remaining 13 being carried out by ten active dis­
trict judges and one active judge of the United States Customs
Court.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
        FEDERAL MAGISTRATES SYSTEM
  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Fed­
eral Magistrates System was presented by its Chairman, Judge
Charles M. Metzner.

             MAGISTRATES FOR THE V!RGIN ISLANDS

   The Conference approved appropriate legislation amending the
Federal Magistrates Act to permit the Conference to authorize
United States magistrate positions for the Virgin Islands whenever
it deems such positions to be warranted.

                   "SECURITY FOR MAGISTRATES

   The Conference approved and authorized the Director of the Ad­
ministrative Office to transmit to the Congress an appropriate legis­
lative proposal to include United States magistrates within the pro­
tection of Section 1114 of Title 18, United States Code, whi~h
makes it a federal crime to kill any judge, United States Attorney,
marshal or other officer engaged in the performance of his official
duties.
   This action would also include United States magistrates within
the coverage of 18 U.S.C. 111 which makes it a federal crime to
                                         67 


assault, resist or impede a designated officer or employee in the per­
formance of his official duties.

              CHANGES IN ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

   The current administrative regulations permit a part-time mag­
istrate to claim up to 85 percent of his own salary for reimburse­
ment of secretarial and clerical salary expenses, up to ten percent
more for related employee benefit costs, and up to an additional
ten percent for miscellaneous office expenses. To simplify account­
ing procedures, the Conference on recommendation of the commit­
tee approved merging the first two categories into a single category
and authorizing a part-time magistrate to claim up to 100 percent
of his salary for such expenses, as follows:
  See. 1.4 Appointment and Oompensation of 8eQretarial and Olerical A.8Sist­
ants.-(b) (iii) Reimbursement OeiUng.-The aggregate amount to be reim­
bursed in a fiscal year to a part-time magistrate for salaries of seeretarial and
clerical assistants and expenses authorized in section 1.5 (b) may not exceed 100
percent of the annual salary authorized for his position by the Judicial Confer­
ence. unless the Director waives this limitation for /i:ood cause shown.
  See. 1.5 Related Benefits of Secretarial and Clerical A8sistants.-( b) Part­
time Magistrate.-A part,time magistrate will be reimbursed on a monthly basis
for the cost of unemployment insurance, life insurance, health insurance, Social

                  CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

   At the request of the committee, the Conference ratified the ac­
tions of its Executive Committee continuing the part-time mag­
istrate position at El Centro, California, for an additional four-year
term, at the currently authorized salary, and expanding the juris­
diction of the part-time magistrate at Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania,
to include that portion of the Delaware Water Gap National Rec­
reation Area lying within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
   The Conference announced that each of its authorizations under

magistrate position shall be deemed to continue until such time as
the pertinent district court finds that a qualified attorney is avail­
able to fill the position.
  The Conference approved recommendations of the committee
to increase the number of full-time magistrate positions from 133
to 143 and to decrease the number of part-time positionrirom 337

trict of Maryland, Huntington in the Southern District of West
Virginia and Houston in the Southern District of Texas.

                       COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES

    At its September 1974 meeting the Conference authorized the
 payment of all future government-wide cost-of-living increases (1)
 to those full-time magistrates whose salaries are below the maxi­
 mum amount authorized by law, and (2) to those part-time mag­
 istrates whose salaries had been fixed at one of 18 proposed, interim
 salary levels. The general cost-of-living increase provided last
 October to government employees was paid to eligible magistrates
 in accordance with this authorization.
    In working toward a system of standard salary levels for all part­
time magistrates, the Conference has sought to minimize disruption
to existing arrangements by withholding comparability increases
 from part-time magistrate positions where the current annual
salary is moderately higher than the pertinent workload would
justify. This procedure will eventually place such positions into
standard salary levels by allowing the levels to "catch up" with the
 positions without the necessity of making small salary cuts.
    As soon as appropriated funds are available for the fiscal year
 1976, the salaries of approximately 270 of the 350 part-time and
combination magistrate positions will be payable at one of the 18
salary levels proposed last September. The salaries of the remaining
80 part-time magistrates are, in the view of the Committee, moder­
ately above the appropriate amount.
    At its March 1975 meeting the Conference consolidated three
of the 18 interim salary levels, approved a final, reduced list of 15
salary levels, and directed that all recommendations for substantive
changes in part-time magistrate salaries in the future be made to
one of these levels. The committee believes that in fairness those
magistrates whose salaries had been fixed at one of the levels sub­
sequently consolidated should continue to receive annual cost-of­
living adjustments, even though their pertinent salary levels will
eventually be phased out.
                                74 

   On committee recommendation the Conference reaffirmed its
authorization of September 1974 for the payment of cost-of­
living increases to part-time magistrates only where the author­
ized salaries are set at the 15 standard levels. The Conference also
authorized that the scheduled increases be given to those part­
time magistrates whose salaries have been set at the three levels
proposed last September, but subsequently consolidated.

    COMMITTEE TO IlYIPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                J"USTICE ACT 

 The report of the ConllIlittee to Implement the Criminal Justice
Act was presented to the Conference by Judge Dudley B. BonsaI,
Chairman of the committee.

                 ApPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to disseminat€ to the chief judges of all United States dis­
trict courts and to all defender organizations the report of the
Administrative Office on appointments and payments made under
the Criminal Justice Act for the p€riod ending June 30, 1975.
   This report showed that during fiscal year 1975 approximately
46,000 p€rsons were represented by assigned counselor by de­
fender organizations established pursuant to the Criminal Justice
Act. The number of p€rsons represented in 1975 increas€d ap­
proximat€ly nine percent over the number represented in the
l}fior fiscal year.
   Congress appropriated $15,826,000 for the implementation of
the act and the Administrative Office has estimated a deficit of
$1,500,000 for fiscal year 1975 for which a supplemental appropri­
ation has been requested. The two factors for this deficiency were
the increase in the number of p€rsons represented and the increase
in transcript rates authorized by the Judicial Conference in Sep­
tember 1974. The chief judges of the circuits approved 137 claims
for compensation in excess of the statutory limitation in felony
cases. The sum of $1,728,424 was paid out of the 1974 appropria­
tion for transcripts, expert and other services, with the cost of
transcripts being the largest single factor.

                        DEFENDER OFFICES

  The cost of operating twenty federal public defender qffices was
approximately $3.6 million in 1975. Federal public defenders were
                                          75 


assigned 10,337 ca&es. The overa.Il cost of representation by federal
 public defenders, including appeals, was $360 compared to ap­
proximately $350 per case for services rendered by panel attorneys
a.nd $374 per case for community defenders.
   Since July 1, 1974 Judge Bonsal advised that new federal public
defender offices had been established in the District of Colorado,
the Eastern District of Kentucky, the Eastern District of Louisi­
ana, the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Southern District
of Texas and the Western District of Texas.
   The Conference considered the individual budget requests for
each of the federal public defender offices for the fiscal year ending
September 30, 1977, for the transition period of July 1 through
September 30, 1976 and revised estimates for fiscal year 1976. The
results of the Conference action were incorporated in the report
of the Budget Committee.

                 COMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS

  In implementation of the action taken by the Conference in
approving grants for fiscal year 1976 to community defender or­
ganizations (Conf. Rept., March 1975, p. 34) the Conference
approved an additional grant to the Legal Aid and Defender Asso­
ciation of Detroit in the Eastern District of Michigan for space
requirements in the sum of $27,500 and for personnel and other
requirements the sum of $100,000. The request for the additional
grant was predicated upon the unexpected higher caseload in one
of the major crime areas in the country and the fact that the
present office space is hardly adequate to meet the current needs.

                                   GUIDELINES

   The Conference approved a revision of the guideline appearing
in Chapter 2A(5) which provides that defendants having Criminal
Justice Act counsel but who have resources in excess of the amount
needed to provide the necessities of life may be directed to pay
such excess to the clerk of court. The guideline, as amended, au­
thorizes the judicial officers thereafter to increase or decrease the
emount of such payments, depending on the financial condition
of the defendant at the time. As approved by the Conference, the
guideline reads:
   If a peI'S()n's net financial resources and income anticipated prior to trial are
in excess of the amount needed to provide him and his dependents with the
necessities of life and to provide the defendant's release on bond, but are insuf­
fiC'ient to pay fully for retained counsel, the judicial ofiirer should find the person
t:ligible for the appointment of counsel under the Act and should direct him to
                                        76 

pay the available excess funds to the clerk of the court at the time of such ap­
pointment or from time to time thereafter. Such funds shall be held subject to
the provisions of subsection (f). The judicial officer may increase or decrease the
amount of such payments, and impose such other conditions as from time to time
may be appropriate. With respect to the disposition of such funds refer to Chapter
II of these Guidelines.

        COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                    PROCEDURE 

  The report of the standing Committee on the Rules of Practice
and Procedure was presented by the Chairman, Judge Roszel C.

                            BANKRUPTCY RULES

Court, with an endorsement for favorable action, certain amend­
ments, largely technical and correctional in nature, to the rules
previously adopted by the Supreme Court in implementation of
Chapters I-VII and Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act. Judge
Thomsen advised the Conference that when these correctional rules
and the rules under Chapters VIII and IX are approved and be­
come effective, the work of the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy
Rules will have been completed.
                              CRIMINAL RULES

  On recommendation of the Standing Committee, the Conference
approved for transmittal to the Supreme Court of the United States
a series of amendments to Rules 6, 23, 24, 40.1, 41 and 50 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as well as rules governing
Seotions 2254 and 2255 cases in the United States district courts.
  The Conference considered proposed amendments to Rule 35 of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and in view of the several
ohanges made in the proposed rule since the last circulation for
                                      77 


comment, the Conference directed that the committee transmit
Rule 35 in its present form once again to the bench and bar of the
country for comment.

                  BICENTENNIAL COMMITTEE
   Judge Edward J. Devitt, co-chairman with Judge Clement F.
Haynsworth, Jr., presented the report of the Bicentennial Com­
mittee.
   Judge Devitt advised that the committee held its organizational
meeting in July at which time the Director of the Administrative
Office, Mr. Rowland F. Kirks, was named secretary. The committee
at that time decided on five projects, including a series of films to
commemorate the Bicentennial of American Independence. The
other projects include a book dealing with the judicial system with
aspects of operation of particular interest to laymen; the prepara­
tion of a history of courts within each of the circuits; a preparation
of a biography of every federal judge from the beginning to the
present; and a Joint Conference of Chief Justices and Governors of
the American Bar Association and other interested parties to com­
memorate the seventieth anniversary of the speech of Roscoe
Pound on the popular dissatisfaction with the administration of
the courts which was given in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1906. After
discussion, the Conference adopted the following resolution:
                                  RESOLUTION
  Resolved, that the Judicial Conference of the United States participate in a
celebration honoring Th>an Roscoe- Pound on the occasion of the 70th Anniversary
of his monumental address of 1906 to the American Bar Association on "The
Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice" by holding
its Annual Spring Meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota, tentatively during the sec­
ond week of April ]976, provided such project is developed.
  The Conference further delegated to the committee authority
to commit and expend funds appropriated for the observance by
the judiciary of the Bicentennial and to enter into contractual
arrangements appropriate for those purposes.

                          OTHER MATTERS
                        ADMISSION TO PRACTICE

   The Conference took note that the Second Circuit Judicial Coun­
cil had approved in principle proposed rules for admission in the
district courts of the circuit and had adopted rules for admission
                                       78 


to the Court of Appeals. The Conference noted the resolution of
the judicial council expressing the view of its committee on the
proposed rule of admission that the desirable objective would be to
avoid Balkanization of requirements for admission in the federal
courts.
  On motion of the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit, the Con­
ference approved a resolution to permit the Chief Justice to
appoint a special committee or to take such other action as he
deems appropriate for the purpose of examining the proposed rules
for admission approved by the Judicial Council of the Second Cir­
(mit, with a view to using the proposed rules as model drafts for
other federal courts.

              CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL QUARTERS

   The Conference noted that the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts is now housed in four separate buildings, one
of which is a considerable distance from downtown Washington,
and none of them is near the Supreme Court. The Conference fur­
ther noted that the Federal Judicial Center has now run out of
all available space in its present quarters. Accordingly, the Con·
ference voted the following resolution:
   It is the sense of the Judicial Conference that there is a strong need for an
appropriate building to be constructed in close proximity to the Supreme Court
of the United States at the earliest possible d1lte which will house all supporting
facilities of the federal judiciary. including the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts, the Federal Judicial Center and the Panel on Multidis­
trict Litigation, with adequate space for storage before being sent to National
Archives.
                              RESOLUTIONS

   Noting the serious illness of Judge Alfred P. Murrah, the Con­
ference requested the Chief Justice to transmit the greetings and
good wishes of the members of the Conference by telegram to
Judge Murrah .
. Observing that the Honorable Harvey M. Johnsen, former Chief
Judge of the Eighth Circuit, had died, the Conference approved the
following resolution:
  The Judicial Conference of the United States, meeting in Washington, D.C.
on September 26, 1975, notes with sadness the death of Harvey M. Johnsen on
September 15, 1975.
  He had completed almost thirty-five years of service as a United States Cir­
cuit Judge. Preceding his federal service he was an Associate Justice of the
                                          79 

  Nebraska Supreme CO'urt and at an earlier time President O'f the State Bar O'f
  Nebraska.
      He loyally served this Conference as a member fO'r six years. FrO'm time to'
  time he was a member O'f five cO'mmittees (chairman of twO') O'ver a period O'f
. twenty years.
      In all O'f this service his steady hand was always effective. His repOrt fO'r the
  CO'mmittee O'n Responsibilities of Judicial CO'uncils has become the standard
  everywhere fO'r the operatiO'n O'f such cO'uncils. The repO'rt resulted in the coun­
  cils becoming effective instruments in the administration O'f circuit business.
     In a time O'f great grO'wth O'f the cO'untry and a faster grO'wth O'f the federal
  judicial system, he brought unusual insight, fO'resight, and accuracy to' the
  prO'jectiO'n of the needs fO'r additiO'nal federal judgeships. None O'f the recO'm­
  mendations was ever discO'unted by the .Judicial CO'nference O'f the United States
  O'r by the CO'ngress.
     Nebraska has IO'st O'ne of its great citizens. The federal judiciary has IO'st one
  O'f its great judges.
