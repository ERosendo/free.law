                                April 7, 1976

and District Judges Dudley B. BonsaI, Edward J. Devitt and

Conference.

  A written report of the activities of the Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation was submitted by Circuit Judge John Minor Wisdom,

           REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE 

         ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF U.S. COURTS 

  The Director of the Administrative Office, Rowland F. Kirks,
submitted a mid-year report to the Conference on the business of
the United States Courts for the six-month period ending
December 31, 1975.
  "On designation of the Chief JUBtlC~. Judge James R. Browning attended the Confer­
ence In place of Chief Judge Richard H. Chambers.
                                   3


   The report showed a continuation of the upward trend in case
filings in every area except criminal cases where the number of
filings was stabilized at approximately 20,000 for the six-month
period. Filings in the courts of appeals for the six months ending
December 31 showed a 13.2 percent increase over the same period
in 1974. Civil case filings rose by 16.3 percent in the same period
and bankruptcy filings rose 9.5 percent.
   During the first six months of the current fiscal year the juror
usage index rose to 19.87, a slight increase over the number re­
corded in the first half of fiscal year 1975. The percentage of pro­
spective jurors selected for or serving on jury trials was 59.6 percent
as compared to 58.7 percent during the same period in fiscal year
1975. This increase in selected or serving jurors, Mr. Kirks reported,
is the result of the implementation of juror utilizat~on techniques,
such as multiple selection of juries, juror pooling, improved meth­
ods of communication with jurors, such as code-a-phone, and local
rules permitting the use of less than 12-memoor civil juries.
    The slow down in criminal filings and increase in such cases
closed by th~ district courts, plus an increase in the use of pro­
bation by United States magistrates, has resulted in an all-time
high of 65,568 persons under the supervision of the federal proba­
tion service on December 31, 1975. This was five percent greater
than a year ago and 71 percent more than June 30, 1970.
   Preliminary figures for the first six months of fiscal year 1976
showed that United States magistrates handled a total of 125,685
matters, an increase of three percent. Trial jurisdiction matters
increased eight percent and precommitment matters were down 8.8
percent. These workload figures show a 15 percent increase in the
number of additional duties being delegated to magistrates by the
district courts.
                   COURT ADMINISTRATION

  The report of the Committee on Court Administration was pre­
sented by the Chairman, Judge Robert A. Ainsworth, Jr.

               PLACES AND DIVISIONS OF HOLDING CoURT

  The Conference approved S. 2412, a bill approved by the judges
of the Northern District of Mississippi and the Judicial Council
of the Fifth Circuit which would permit office space for a district
judge in the Federal Building in Corinth, Mississippi, where the


  209-960 0·76 - 2
                                       4

judge now has an office, paid for by him despite the fact that space
is available in the Federal Building.
   The Conference also approved 8. 2887 which would realign the
counties in the Northwestern Division of North Dakota. The Con­
ference was advised that the counties have been allocated in the
past on the basis of railroad communications whereas the proposed
realignment would accommodate highway communications. The
bill was approved by the judges of the district as well as the Judicial
Council of the Eighth Circuit.
   The Conference disapproved S. 1423, a bill to create an additional
judicial district in Alabama, to be known as the Tennessee Valley
District. The bill had previously been disapproved by the judges
of the districts in Alabama as well as by the Judicial Council of the
Fifth Circuit.
                  SALARIES OF UNGRADED EMPLOYEES

  The Conference noted that since the Committee on Court
Administration had met the Congress had raised the salaries of
full-time referees in bankruptcy and that the 8enate had passed a
bill raising the salaries of full-time United States magistrates
which was then pending in the House of Representatives. At the
September 1975 session of the Conference (ConI. Rept., p. 48) the
Conference had requested the committee to study further the max­
imum limitations imposed on salaries of clerks of court. Because
of the change in the situation relating to referees and magistrates,
Chief Judge Whipple proposed and the Conference adopted a
resolution which
  (1) Reaffirms, but temporarily suspends, the report of the Committee on
Salaries which is contained in the report of the October 1971 session of the
Judicial Conference of the United States, p. 65;
   (2) Authorizes an increase in the salary of the clerks of the larger courts to
$86,000 per year, the clerks of the medium courts to $3],500 per year, the clerks
of the smaller courts to $28.200 per year and the salary of the clerk of the
United States District Court for Guam to $26,100 (the salaries of the other
territorial courts are included in the first three categories), such salary
increases to be effective at the beginning of the second pay period following
the adoption of the resolution and subject to the availability of funds; and
   (3) Asks that the report of the Committee on Salaries adopted at the Octo·
ber 1971 session be reviewed by the Judicial Conference at such time as Congress
changes the salaries of federal judges.
                                  5


                         FEES AND COSTS

  The Conference approved a recommendation for and authorized
the Director of the Administrative Office to transmit to the Con­
gress a bill which would authorize the Judicial Conference of the
United Stares to fix fees and costs in the Unired States District
Court for the District of Columbia as it does for other federal
district courts. This legislation, recommended by the judges of
the District Court for the District of Columbia, is intended to
cure an oversight in the District of Columbia Court Reorganization
Act of 1970 which left in force and effect for the District Court the
fees and charges set for the courts of the District of Columbia.

                      ANNUITIES TO JUDGES

  The Conference strongly disapproved H.R. 11299 and H.R.
11738, bills to deny to federal judges any annuities under the Civil
Service Commission Retirement Fund. The bill as drafted would
deny any annuity paymen ts to any federal justice or judge while
he is receiving salary as a justice or judge of the United States,
whether in active or senior status. It affects primarily judges who
have previously served in the Congress or in the Executive Branch
of the Government for an extended period.

             SUPPORTING PERSONNEL--INTERPRETERS

  The Conference approved two permanent full-time Spanish­
speaking interpreters for the District of Arizona and authorized
that the court be permitted to retain Indian dialect interpreters
as needed.
                           LEGISLATION

   (1) The Conference noted that the recommendations of the
American L9.w Institute on diversity and federal question juris­
diction were not embodied in any legislation introduced in the
94th Congress. The Conference reaffirmed its approval in prin­
ciple of such legislation and recommended further that until pas­
sage of such legislation can be accomplished and in order to pro­
vide immediate relief to the United States district courts, the
                                       6


Congress enact an amendment to Section 1332(a)(l) of Title 28,
United States Code, to read:
   (1) Citizens of different states, if none of the parties in interest properly
joined as plaintiffs Is a citizen of the states in which such action is brought;

   The proposal would prohibit the plaintiff from filing a diversity
suit in a district court in a state in which he is a citizen. Prior
studies conducted by the Administrative Office indicate that adop­
tion of such a proposal would initially exclude from the federal
courts approximately 45 percent of all diversity actions. The Direc­
tor of the Administrative Office was authorized to prepare a draft
bill for submission to Congress.
   (2) The Conference's views were sought on H.R. 10344, a bill
which would authorize the President to issue orders and regulations
to provide for the establishment of priorities of use and for sys­
tematic allocation and pricing of propane in order to meet the
needs of various sections of the country and to lessen anticompeti­
tive effects resulting from shortages of natural gas. Exclusive
original jurisdiction is vested in the United States district courts
and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in the Temporary Emergency
Court of Appeals. The Conference agreed that this proposal in­
volved basically a matter of legislative policy but agreed that a
suggestion be made to the Congress that the bill be amended to
authorize the trial of cases involving violations of orders and reg­
ulations issued under the act before the United States magistrates
with the consent of the defendant.
    (3) The Conference considered H.R. 7826, 7827 and 7828 which
would authorize the awarding of attorneys fees in certain civil
actions. The Conference noted that several similar bills had been
introduced in the Congr~"8 following the decision of the Supreme
Court in 1975 in the Alyeska Pipeline case (421 U.S. 240) which
held that absent specific Congressional authorization, attorneys
 fees cannot be awarded to a prevailing party to litigation except
 in certain circumstances. While the Conference agreed that the
 subject matter of these bills is a question of public policy for the
 detennination of the Congress, two problems connected with such
 legislation should be brought to the attention of the Congress:
   (1) The potential impact on the workload of the courts which may be small
or exceedingly large, depending on the type of legislation which is passed and
for which adequate judicial resources should be provided in advance of the
effective date thereof; and
                                        7

   (2) The eonstitutionality of awarding attorneys fees to prevailing plaintiffs
in suits against state offieers due to the restrietive prm'isions of the Eleventh
Amendment to the Constitution.

  The Conference agreed that H.R. 10748, a. bill to extend the
warning label required on cigarette packages to advertisements
as well as regulating smoking in federal facilities and on int.er­
state carriers, embodies a matter of policy on which the CO'nfer­
ence expresses no views but that the Congress should be advised of
the potential impact of such legislation on the federal cO'urt system.
   (4) The Conference agreed that H.R. 9218 relating to environ­
mental hazards involves a policy questiO'n for legislative determi­
nation. The bill does, however, provide that upon a showing
giving rise to a rebuttable presumption that a threat to public
health exists, the burden of proof shifts to the person engaging
in such conduct. Section 5 O'f the bill, however, provides that
nothing in the act shall affect the burden of proof with respect to
the question of whether any violation of statute administered by
the administrator has been committed. The CO'nference agreed
to the suggestion that the bill should be redrafted sO' as to avoid
any inconsistency with rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence
and that Section 5 should be clarified.
   (5) The ('A)nference a.greed that S. 1284 relating to the antitrust
laws involves a policy question for the Congress. The Conference
did, however, approve the submission to the Congress of a state­
ment on the workload of the courts in relation to antitrust actions.

                        REVIEW COMMITTEE
  Judge Edward A. Tamm, Chairman, presented the report of
the Committee.
   The Conference approved three recommendations of the CO'm­
mittee with respect to the public report form of extrajudicial
income, as follows:
   (1) That the form be revised insofar as it pertains to bequests, t'() state
affirmatively that it is not necessary for a judicial officer to list bequests in
which the devisor is a member of the judge's family within the relationships
defined in Canon 3C(I) (d) and that the sections dealing with gifts and bequests
be consolidated into a single section appropriately identified.
   (2) That the form be revised so as to include therein in the descriptive data
In Section 1 "Extrajudicial Services" a specific reference to the provisions and

    JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE CODE OF JUDICIAL 

                   CONDUCT 


  The report of the Joint Committee on the Code of Judicial Con­
duct of which Judge Elbert P. Tuttle and Judge Edward A. Tamm
are co-Chairmen was presented to the Conference by Judge Tuttle.
  At the September 1975 session of the Conference the recommen­
dation was approved for the preparation of a document in the
nature of an overview of the origin and work of the Review Com­
mittee, the Joint Committee, and the Advisory Committee on Ju­
dicial Activities. Such a document was submitted to the Conference
which approved its release by the Director of the Administrative
Office to all federal judges and other interested parties.
  The Conference disapproved the provisions of S. 181, S. 192
and S. 2295 insofar as they require financial disclosure by federal
                                     9

judges since the Conference has already developed a reporting
and disclosure procedure for the federal judges.

  ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES
  Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Chairman, presented the report of the
Advisory Committee on Judicial Activities.
  Judge Tuttle reported that in the last six months the Commit­
tee has received 17 formal inquiries. To date, the Committee has
considered and acted upon 97 formal submissions, resulting in the
publication of 47 separate formal opinions. The two published in
the last six months are:
   (1) Opinion No. 46-Acceptance by judges of public testimonials or awards,
and
   (2) Opinion No. 47-Acceptance of complimentary memberships in profes­
sional and social clubs.

   COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF THE JURY
                  SYSTEM

 Judge Arthur J. Stanley, Chairman, presented the report of the
Committee.

      PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE JURY SELECTION AND
                              SERVICE ACT

  The Committee recommended and the Conference approved
draft legislation for transmission to the Congress which would (1)
establish a presumption that names of prospective jurors contained
in voter lists represent a fair cross-section of the community, and
(2) require a finding by the court that voter lists for that district
do not represent such a fair cross-section before the voter lists may
be supplemented by other sources of juror names. This legislative
proposal is a response to the increasing number of cases challenging
the process of jury selection.
   The Conference voted its disapproval of S. 2779, a bill which
would provide for non-unanimous jury verdicts in civil cases. The
Conference noted the committee's view that the requirement of
unanimity in jury verdicts, besides being in accord with tradition
and precedent, serves the continuing function of assuring maxi­
mum protection to the expression of minority views in jury delib­
erations.
                                10 


                    JUROR PRIVACY PROJECT

   The Committee advised the Conference that a subcommittee had
prepared a report on this subject involving pretrial investigation
of prospeetive jurors which concludes that it would not be advis­
able to suggest the adoption of any uniform rule in this area. A
survey of district courts indicates that no significant problem has
resulted from the present lack of a uniform practice and that local
conditions and the practices of the local bar should be determina­
tive of the procedure to be followed by the court. The Committee
was also of the view that the courts at present have sufficient in­
herent and statutory powers to cope with any abuses or complaints
which might result from such pretrial investigation and that each
district court remains free to adopt a local rule. The Conference
approved the transmittal of the subcommittee report to all federal
district judges.

  COMMITTEE ON THE ADMIN ISTRATION OF THE
               CRIMINAL LAW

  The report of the Committee on the Administration of the Crim­
inal Law was presented by the Chairman, Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli.

               MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

  The Conference recommended disapproval of S. 2698 which
would amend Title 18, United States Code, to impose mandatory
minimum terms with respect to certain offenses. Judge Zirpoli re­
ported to the Conference that the Committee on the Ad­
ministration of the Probation System joined with his committee
in recommending the disapproval of this legislation since there is
no demonstrated need for it. It would unnecessarily prolong the
sentencing process and engender additional appellate review and
would increase the expenditure of public funds without increase
in additional benefits.

                    SENTENCING CoMMISSION

  The Conference disapproved S. 2699, a bill which would estab­
lish certain guidelines for sentencing and provide for the estab­
lishment of a United States Commission on Sentencing. The
Committee on the Administration of the Probation System joined
                                     11 

the Criminal Law Committee in this recommendation, as well as
agreeing that there is no need for the creation of such a Commis­
sion; that the courts have for years been utilizing pre-sentence
reports which are prepared under guidelines promulgated with the
approval of the Judicial Conference and there is no reason to
believe that guidelines established by a commission would prove
more effective in meeting the problem of disparity of sentences;
and that a straight-forward review of sentences, whether by ap­
pellate review or by a panel of three judges as provided in the
proposed amendment to Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, is to be preferred over the proposed legislation.

                          YOUTH CoRRECTIONS ACT

   The Conference approved a draft bill which would amend the
Youth Corrections Act so that the court may as a condition of
probation or as a condition for treatment for a youth offender
committed to the custody of the Attorney General require the
youth offender to pay a fine or make restitution to the aggrieved
party of actual damages or loss caused by the offense of the youth
offender. The Conference authorized the Director of the Adminis­
trative Office to submit the draft bill to the Con~ess.

  PERSONS ACQUITTED ON GROUNDS OF MENTAL INCOMPETENCY

   The Conference reaffirmed a previous recommendation twice sub­
mitted to the Conference which would amend Title 18, Unit.ed
States Code, to provide for a hearing to determine whether or not
an accused is mentally competent to stand trial and to provide for
civil commitment, after hearing with appropriate due process safe­
gua,rda, of a defendant who having been charged with an offense
against the United States is acquitted after raising the defense
of lack of criminal responsibility and who is further found by rea­
son of mental disea,se or defect to be a danger to himself or the
person or property of others.

                         PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS

  Judge Zirpoli advised the Conference that his Committee and
the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System have given
consideration to substantial changes in jury instructions which
will be required if S. 1, the bill for the codification of the criminal

    209-960 0 - 76 - 3
                                 12 


code, is enacted. The bill makes such substantial changes in the
substantive law of crime that it will require any group working
on the project at least two or three years to prepare jury instruc­
tions to a lay jury. The Conference authorized the Chief Justice,
if S. 1 should be enacted, to appoint a committee to prepare pat­
tern jury instructions, with full authority to include not only judges
but representation from the bar and the Department of Justice.

                     FEDERAL CRIMINAL CODE

   Judge Zirpoli briefed the Conference on the provisions of S. 1,
the new proposed federal criminal code, as the bill now stands
before the Senate. He submitted a report to the Conference made
by his committee in conjunction with the Committee on the Opera­
tion of the Jury System, the Committee on the Administration
of the Probation System, the Committee on the Administration
of the Federal Magistrates System and the Advisory Committee
on Criminal Rules. The Conference agreed that copies of this report
should be sent to the Chairmen and each member of the judiciary
committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

                         SPEEDY TRIAL    ACT
  The Conference approved a recommendation submitted by the
Department of Justice which would amend the Speedy Trial Act
of 1974 to make the exclusions (periods of delay) enumerated in
Section 3161(h) applicable to the time running under Section
3164(b) for those held in continuous custody solely for the pur­
pose of trial or designated as high risk.

   COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
              PROBATION SYSTEM

  Judge Albert C. Wollenberg, Chairman, presented the report
of the Committee on the Administration of the Probation System.

                 VISITS TO   FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS

   Judge Wollenberg advised the Conference that his committee
is concerned that the only exposure to federal correctional insti­
tutions for many district court judges is a brief visit to a medium
or minimum security institution while attending a sentencing in­
                                       13 

stitute. This provides limited exposure to the realities of imprison­
ment. The committee has found that individual sentencing deci­
sions depend in part on current understanding of the facilities,
programs and problems at federal correctional institutions and that
this necessary understanding can be furthered by periodic visits
by the judges to the federal institutions serving their respective
courts. To this end, the committee recommended and the Confer­
ence adoptBd the following resolution:
  Whereas, the Conference notes that one of the most serious responsibilities
of the judges of the district courts is that of imposing sentence in criminal
cases; and
  Whereas, the Conference is of the opinion that informed sentencing decisions
depend in part on a current understanding of the facilities, programs, and prob­
lems at the various Federal correctional institutions; now, therefore be it
  Resolved, that the judges of the district courts, as soon as feasible after
their appointment and periodically thereafter, shall make every effort to visit
the various Federal correctional institutions that serve their respective courts.

                       PRETRIAL SERVICE AGENCIES

   The Committee reported that the ten pretrial service agencies
have acquired their necessary space, furniture and equipment.
In the five agencies administered by the Probation Division aU
professional staff have been selected and have entered on duty.
In the five board of trustees agencies all professional staff have
been selected.
   At the request of the Probation Division, the committee has
endorsed the establishment of Title II type programs with com­
plete data collection in several districts willing to undertake such
a program with existing probation staff. Information obtained
from these districts will strengthen the required evaluation.
   The Committee has advised the Probation Division that it is
of the opinion that the language of Section 3154 of Title 18, United
States Code, makes contract services available to all persons re­
leased under Chapter 207 of Title 18 and does not restrict such
services to residential programs only.

                    NARCOTIC AFTERCARE PRooRAMS

  Judge Wollenberg advised that his Committee has been informed
that the Director of the Bureau of Prisons has formally proposed
the transfer of responsibility for drug treatment from the Bureau
to the Federal Probation System. The Committee noted that Con­
                                  14 


gress has expressed policy in this area through the passage of Title
II of the Speedy Trial Act extending limited contract authority to
the Probation System for drug treatment programs and other sup­
portive services for persons on pretrial release. There is little assur­
ance that a person participating in a drug treatment program as a
condition of pretrial release can continue a treatment program once
placed on probation. Accordingly, the Committee instructed the
Probation Division to explore the problem and report to the
Committee.
   In September 1975 the White House Domestic Council Drug
Abuse Task Force issued its report and recommended that funds
and responsibilities be transferred from the Bureau of Prisons to
the Probation Service which should be made the pay agent for
treatment services for federal parolees and probationers.
   The Committee is of the view that the provision of drug treat­
ment services seems to be a function more appropriate to the Exec­
utive Branch than the Judicial Branch. The Committee recognizes,
however, that the responsibility for persons on probation and parole
rests with the Federal Probation System and that drug treatment
services are necessary for the proper operation of the probation
system. Aside from the issue of who provides them, the services
must be available. The Conference was advised that the Commit­
tee has endorsed a policy position that if the Executive Branch
does not provide these programs and the Congress transfers the
responsibility to the Probation System, then the Probation System
must do its utmost to carry out the intent of Congress.

                       PROBATION PERSONNEL

   At its September 1975 session, the Conference on the recom­
mendation of the Committee on the Budget instructed the Com­
mittee to review and reevaluate the formula being used to deter­
mine the staffing requirements of probation offices prior to the
1976 hearing before the House Appropriations Subcommittee. In
response to the instructions the Probation Division conducted a
time study which was analyzed by the Federal Judicial Center.
This study involved detailed timekeeping by a random sample of
139 officers during the period October 29 to November 25, 1975.
After a review of the final report of the time study, the Committee
has reaffirmed its approval of the formula being used to determine
staffing requirements of the probation offices.

Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office to' study the
                                  19 

procedures followed in the courts for processing bankruptcy ap­
peals under Part VIII of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure to
insure that procedures will result in cases being promptly hrought
before the judges.

    COMMITIEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS

   Judge Roy W. Harper, Chairman of the Committee on Intercir­
cuit Assignments, submitted a written report for the considera­

   During this period the C.ommittee recommended 73 assignments
to be undertaken by 53 judges. Of this number, four are senior
circuit judges, four are active circuit judges, 17 are district judges
in active status and 23 are senior district judges. One retired Su­
preme Court Justice participated in seven assignments. Six assign­
ments involved one active judge from the Court of Claims, two
active judges from the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and
one active judge of the Customs Court.
   Four senior circuit judges, nine senior district judges, and one
retired Supreme Court Justice carried out 26 of the 43 assign­
ments to the circuit courts of appeals which were recommended
during the period. Of the 30 assignments to the district courts,
16 senior district judges participated in 17 assignments, the re­
maining 13 being carried out by ten active district judges and one
active judge of the United States Customs Court.

   COMMI'ITEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
         FEDERAL MAGISTRATES SYSTEM

  In the absence of the Chairman, Judge Charles M. Metzner, the
report of the Committee on the Administration of the Federal
Magistrates System was presented by Judge Donald R. Ross.

                     CoNFLICTS OF INTEREST

  Pursuant to the request of the Judicial Conference at its Sep­
tember 1975 session, the Committee obtained the views of the
judiciary on the proposal to preclude a part-time magistrate from
accepting fees for services performed as a special master, whether
or not such service is rendered in the magistrate's official capacity.
The proposal would also preclude the taxing of fees against liti­
                                      20 


gants for the magistrate's service. The assess~ent of costs for other
expenses of the referees would not be covered by the resolution.
   In the light of the responses received from the questionnaires
sent to all federal judges, the Committee reconsidered its proposal
and again recommended to the Conference that as a matter of
policy a part-time magistrate be precluded from accepting fees, in
addition to the salary set for his position by the Conference, for
services }J€rformed as a s}J€cial master, whether or not the service
is rendered in the magistrate's official capacity. The Conference
agreed to this policy statement and also to the recommendation
that no fees should be taxed against litigants for such service.

                 CHANGES IN MAGISTRATES POSITIONS

   Prior to the meeting of the Conference, the Executive Commit­
tee authorized, upon recommendation of the Administrative Office
and the Magistrates Committee, the conversion of the part-time
magistrate position at Charlotte in the Western District of North
Carolina to a combination deputy clerk-magistrate position at no
change in the currently authorized $8,000 annual compensation.
The Conference ratified the action of its Executive Committee.
   After full consideration of the survey reports of the Director of
the Administrative Office regarding changes in magistrates posi­
tions and salaries, together with the views of the district courts
and the circuit councils concerned, as well as the Committee recom­
mendations, the Conference approved the following changes
which, unless otherwise indicated, are to be effective when appro­
priated funds are available.

     COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE CRIMINAL 

                 JUSTICE ACT 


 The report of the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice
Act was presented by the Chairman, Judge Dudley B. BonsaL

                 APPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

   The Conference authorized the Director of the Administrative
Office to disseminate to the chief judges of all United States dis­
trict courts, to all defender organizations and to any other inter­
ested parties the report of the Administrative Office on appoint­
ments and payments made under the Criminal Justice Act for the
period ending December 31, 1975.
   This report showed that during the first half of fiscal year 1976
there were 19,613 persons represented under the Criminal Justice
Act, a 5.8 percent increase over the number represented during the
first half of fiscal year 1975. Private attorneys were appointed to
represent 11,756 persons and federal defender organizations were
assigned 7,857 cases, the latter representing an increase of 17
percent.
   Judge BonsaI reported that since the last session of the Con­
ference a new federal public defender organization has become
operational in the Western District of Texas.
   Congress appropriated $18,890,000 for fiscal year 1976 which in­
cludes a supplemental of $2.3 million. For fiscal year 1977 an
appropriation request was made for $20,686,000.

               FEDERAL PuBLIC DEFENDER       OFFICES
   In accordance with the requirements of the Criminal Justice
Act the Conference approved a proposed budget for the remainder
of fiscal year 1976, the transition period, and for fiscal year 1977
for the new public defender office established in the Western Dis­
trict of Texas in the amounts of $188,500 for fiscal year 1976,
$69,700 for the transition quarter and $294,900 for fiscal year 1977,
with an eventual staff of seven attorneys, two investigators and
five secretaries.

               CoMMUNITY DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS

  The Federal Defenders of San Diego, Inc., which operated on
an initial grant approved by the Judicial Conference and since that
time has been submitting vouchers for individual cases only, has
now submitted a request for sustaining grants for the transition
quarter, commencing July 1, 1976, and for fiscal year 1977 in the
amounts of $150,000 and $612,000. On recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference approved the grants in the amounts
requested.
  The Conference likewise approved sustaining grants for other community
defender organizations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1977, as follows:
Atlanta, Georgia ____________ $158.941 New York. New York________ 863.200
Chicago, Illinois____________ 293, 000 Portland, Oregon____________ 130,000
Detroit, Michigan___________ 575,000 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania__ 291,500
Minneapolis, Minnesota______    33,185
  The Conference also approved a supplemental grant in the amount of $5,000 for
the Community Defender Organization in Portland, Oregon, for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1976.

    INVESTIGATION OF ASSISTANT FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS

  Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed
to rescind its requirement that all prospective assistant federal
public defenders be subiect to a full-field investigation by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation prior to employment. In lieu
thereof, the Conference agreed that only a name check will be
required unless the federal public defender concerned requests a
full-field investigation. The report of any investigation made of
an assistant federal public defender shall be transmitted to the
federal public defender concerned since by statute he is the appoint­
ing officer.
          REIMBURSEMENT AS A CONDITION OF PRoBATION

   Judge BonsaI advised that his Committee had noted that some
.rudicial officers are requiring as a condition of probation reimburse­
ment by. the defendant of funds expended under the Criminal
Justice Act by the government for his defense. He advised that
the Committee has reaffirmed the current guideline which reads
that:
 Subsection (f) of the Act does not authorize a judicial officer to require reim­
 bursement as a condition of prohation.

      COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND 

                  PROCEDURE 


  The report of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Pro­
cedure was presented by the Chairman, Judge Roszel C. Thomsen.
   At the September 1975 session of the Conference there were
approved for transmittal to the Supreme Court, with an endorse­
ment for favorable action, proposed rules under Chapter IX of
the Bankruptcy Act relating to Composition of Indebtedness of
Certain Taxing Agencies. On March 25, 1976, the Congress ap­
proved for transmittal to the President for signature a bill amend­
ing Chapter IX which when signed became Public Law 94-260.
Anticipating the passage of this bill, the Committee had arranged
with the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules to prepare
an amended set of Chapter IX rules to conform to the proposed
new statute. These rules were submitted to the standing Com­
mittee and approved, with minor modifications. The Conference
approved these new C'llapter IX rules, as amended, for immediate
transmittal to the Supreme Court in place of the Chapter IX rules
approved at the September 1975 session.

               BICENTENNIAL COMMITTEE

   Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., and Judge Edward J. Devitt,
co-Chairmen, submitted a report to the Judicial Conference on
the work of the Bicentennial Committee.
   The report stated that the Committee is completing negotiations
with Metropolitan Pittsburgh Public Broadcasting, Inc., for the
production of five films available to the general public for use in
the classroom and at group meetings, and a ninety minute special
feature film, formed of excerpts of the movies, to be shown on
prime time on public broadcasting stations. The movies will focus
on early decisions that were significant in the development of this
country's federal system. The movies are expected to be available
for distribution in the fall of 1976.
   The Committee's projected popular book, intended for use pri­
marily by the lay public and focusing on the role of our courts, is
being written by Professor Sidney Hyman of the University of
Illinois at Chicago and should be available for distribution during
the summer of 1976.
                                        26 

    In furthering the biographical directory project the Committee
 has distributed biographical questionnaires to all members of the
 federal judiciary. Similar questionnaires are being completed about
 each deceased judge by a subcommittee of the Bicentennial
 Committee.
    The report stated that the circuits have the option of preparing
 a history of the courts in their geographic area and the Committee
 is considering providing up to $5,000 to each circuit for the writing
 of its history, upon submission of justification thereof.
    The Committee further noted that it has been working closely
 with the planners of the National Conference on the Causes of
 Popular Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice, of
 which the 'Judicial Conference is a co-sponsor, as a very important
 part of the Judiciary's Bicentennial celebration.

                                RESOLUTION

   Noting with deep regret the death of its long-time member and
 Director of the Federal Judicial Center, the Honorable Alfred P.
 Murrah, the Conference adopted the following resolution:
    The Judicial Conference of the United State-s mourns the passing ()f Alfred P.
  Murrah on Octooor 30, 1975. Truly one of the great men of his time, he has
  made a profound and lasting impression on the Judiciary.
    Born in Indian country in 1904, Judge Murrah worked his way through the
  School of Law at the University of Oklahoma. He practiced law in Seminole
  and Oklahoma City, until he was appointed to the United States District Court
  at the age of 32, one- of the youngest men ever appointed to the Federal Bench.
  Only three years later he was elevated to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth
  Circuit. In 1959 he became Chief Judge, a position he held until 1970 when he
  took senior status to succeed Justice Tom Clarl, as the second Director of the
  Federal Judicial Center. Resigning from this position in 1974, he returned to his
  beloved Oklahoma but continued to hear cases even though he was suffering
  from cancer.
    This bare skeletal outline does not begin to suggest the service he rendered
  to the judicial and legal professions, as well as to the community as a whole.
  He was not only a member of this Conference for many years but served on
  many of its Committees. Because of his great capacity as a leader, he usually
  became Chairman of whatever group or committee he served. He held many
  posts in the American Bar Association and the American Judicature Society,
. receiving the Justice Award from the latter organization in September, 1973.
  His many accomplishments, services rendered and honors received would fill
  many pages.
    We looked to him for leadership and depended upon him for his advice. We
  will miss his delightful wit, his warm handshake and friendly smile. As Reverend
  Doctor Hinchley, Pastor of the Crown Heights United Methodist Church in
                                     27 

Oklahoma City, said in concluding his remarks at Judge Murrah's funeral serv­
iee, "This world and the next are richer-oh so richer-because we have been
blessed to have lived with him."


                 REPORTS BY CHIEF JUDGES
  The Conference agreed to dispense in the future with the re­
quirement of the reports on the disposition of cases pending in
the district courts for more than three years and the disposition
of cases under submission in the courts of appeals and cases and
motions under advisement in the district courts heretofore required
by sections (a) and (b) of Agenda Item H.

PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF COURTS OF APPEALS

   The Conference approved the pretermission of terms of courts
of appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 48, for the session of court to be
held by the Fourth Circuit at Asheville, North Carolina, the ses­
sions of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to be held
outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, for the sessions of the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals to be held at Kansas City, Missouri, and
Omaha, Nebraska, and for all sessions of the Tenth Circuit Court
of Appeals to be held at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, prior to the
next session of the Conference.

                              ELECTIONS

  The Conference noting that the term as a member of the Board
of Certification for Circuit Executives of Chief Judge Howard T.
Markey would expire on July 1, 1976, unanimously elected Judge
Markey to serve for another term, commencing July 1, 1976, in
accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 332(f).

            RELEASE OF CONFERENCE ACTION

   The Conference authorized the immediate release of its action on
matters considered at this session where necessary for legislative
or administrative action.
