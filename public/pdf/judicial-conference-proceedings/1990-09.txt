                    REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE
                    ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE
                        UNITED STATES COURTS

        The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, L.
Ralph Mecham, submitted to the Conference the Annual Report of the Director
for the year ended June 30, 1990. The Conference authorized the Director to
release the Annual Report immediately in preliminary form and to revise and
supplement the final printed edition.

                    JUDICIAL BUSINESS OF THE COURTS

       Mr. Mecham reported that during the year ended June 30, 1990, the
number of cases appealed to the 12 regional courts of appeals rose three
percent to 40,898, due to a significant increase of almost 1,500 appeals of
criminal cases. The new sentencing guidelines, which allow for appeal of the
sentence itself, accounted for a portion of this rise in filings; this year, 1,745
appeals concerned sentences only. Dispositions increased three percent this
year to 38,520, but remained below the level of filings, resulting in an eight
percent increase in the pending caseload by year's end. Filings in the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit climbed three percent to 1,466, primarily
due to an increase in appeals from the Merit Systems Protection Board.
Terminations were three percent lower this year, resulting in an 11 percent
increase in the pending caseload.

        In the U.S. district courts, the number of civil filings declined seven
percent during 1990, to 217,879 cases. A change in the jurisdictional amount
from $10,000 to $50,000 resulted in a 15 percent decrease in diversity cases.
Cases involving the U.S. also decreased significantly; U.S. plaintiff filings were
down 10 percent and cases in which the U.S. was a defendant were down eight
percent. Civil cases terminated fell nine percent to 213,922 in 1990, the lowest
total since 1982; since filings slightly outnumbered terminations, the pending
caseload increased two percent to 242,346.
       Criminal case filings rose more than six percent in 1990, following more
moderate increases of three percent in the two previous years. The 48,904
criminal filings represent 85 cases per judgeship, up from 80 per judgeship last
year. The increase in criminal filings is directly attributable to the focus on drug
related crimes. Although actual drug cases increased only six percent, related
criminal offenses, specifically weapons and firearms and immigration violations,
increased 23 percent. While criminal case terminations increased almost four
percent in 1990 to 44,295, filings greatly outnumbered terminations, resulting in
a 15 percent increase in criminal cases pending as of June 30, 1990.

          Bankruptcy filings continued to increase to record levels in 1990, up 13
percent to 725,484 petitions this year. The increase was primarily in non-
business cases, up 14 percent over last year and comprising 91 percent of the
total filings. Although dispositions were up over seven percent, the pending
caseload rose 12 percent to 974,593.

        Mr. Mecham also reported that as of September 1, 1990, there were 10
vacancies among the 168 judgeship positions authorized for the United States
courts of appeals, 33 vacancies among the 575 positions authorized for the
United States district courts, and one vacancy on the United States Court of
International Trade.

                     REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE
                        FEDERAL JUDlClAL CENTER

       The Director of the Federal Judicial Center, Judge William W Schwarzer,
reported to the Conference on fiscal year 1990 Judicial Center activities.

        During the fiscal year 1990, the Center designed and conducted 85
workshops and seminars for over 4,000 judicial officers, court managers, and
other court personnel. In addition, 300 programs were conducted in local court
settings by Center-trained instructional teams and by court training coordinators
working with Center support and consultation.

        Important Judicial Center research projects include, among many others,
studies of court-annexed arbitration, litigation flow, bankruptcy estate
administration, and district court and bankruptcy court time studies. 'The Center
is working with the Administrative Office, judges and others to develop a
deskbook on litigation management to provide judges with practical assistance
in confronting management problems.
        The Center has made it a top priority to offer case management
education and support to judicial branch personnel; to offer programs that will
assist judges and supporting personnel to meet growing responsibilities and
perform increasingly complex and demanding tasks; to complete evaluation of
new technology; to complete research that will provide information needed for
effective reform and assess fairly the impact of innovation on the operations of
the courts; and to further understanding of case management as the path to the
"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination" of litigation.

       Appointed as committee chairmen by Chief Justice Rehnquist,
these distinguished jurists have played a vital role in the administration
of the federal court system. These judges served as leaders of their
Judicial Conference committees while, at the same time, continuing to
perform in their regular capacities as judges in their own courts. They
       have set a standard of skilled leadership and earned our deep respect
       and sincere gratitude for their innumerable contributions.          We
       acknowledge with appreciation their commitment to the federal judiciary
       as shown by their dedicated service to the Judicial Conference and the
       judiciary as a whole.



      The Executive Committee reported that, since the last session of the
Conference in March, 1990, it had addressed the following matters on the
Conference's behalf:

                         CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM ACT

        Subsequent to the March 1990 session (JCUS-MAR 90, p. 9), the
Executive Committee, and its Subcommittee on Civil Justice Reform chaired by
Judge Robert F. Peckham, devoted considerable attention to the proposed Civil
Justice Reform Act, S. 264a3 and H.R. 3898, 10lst Congress. The Committee
recommended, and the Conference approved by vote of 20 to one, a 14 point
"Program to Address the Problems of Cost and Delay in Civil Litigation and to
Improve Case Management"; authorized the Administrative Office to discuss with
congressional staff legislation not inconsistent with the Program; approved a
proposal for implementation of the Program, to include creation of a new
Conference Comrr~itteeon Court Administration and Case Management, effective
September 13, 1990; and approved testimony for presentation before the Senate
Judiciary Committee on Title I of S. 2648.

                          ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS

        The results of the biennial survey of judgeship needs are traditionally
presented for approval to the September session of the Judicial Conference in
even-numbered years.    m,      JCUS-SEP 88, pp. 85-89. However, in order to
have the most current judgeship needs presented to Congress in connection
with its analysis of civil justice reform legislation, the Executive Committee
approved the acceleration of Judicial Conference consideration of this matter.
The Judicial Resources Committee accordingly expedited its review, and the
Executive Committee agreed to poll the Judicial Conference on the results.



       3Successorto S. 2027,101 st Congress, which was unanimously opposed
by the Judicial Conference in March, 1990.
       On June 1, 1990,the Conference voted to recommend the creation of
20 additional judgeships in the United States courts of appeals, and 47
additional permanent judgeships and 29 additional temporary judgeships in the
United States district courts. The Conference also recommended that one
temporary district judgeship be extended for an additional five years, that six
temporary positions be converted to permanent, and that four roving judgeships
be converted to a single district only. Finally, the Conference agreed to
recommend the creation of an additional temporary judgeship for any district
court or court of appeals in which an active judge has been selected as Director
of the Federal Judicial Center.

       'The Conference voted to recommend the creation of additional judgeship
positions in the following United States courts of appeals:

request for district judgeships would be reduced from 76 (47 permanent and 29
temporary) to 19 (6 permanent and 13 temporary).

                    FEDERAL COURTS SI'UDY COMMllTEE

        Title I of Public Law 100-702 established within the Judicial Conference
a Federal Courts Study Committee (FCSC) on the future of the federal judiciary.
As required, the FCSC filed its final report with the Judicial Conference on
April 2, 1990.

        The Conference was advised that certain FCSC recommendations might
 be included in an "omnibus court reform" title of the civil justice reform package
being considered by the 10lst Congress and, consequently, that expedited
review of the recommendations would be advisable.                       The various
recommendations were referred to the committees having jurisdiction of each
and the responses presented to the Executive Committee, which identified those
appropriate for inclusion in non-controversial legislation and left the remainder
for consideration by the Conference in plenary session. The latter category of
items appears throughout these proceedings.

      A. In May, 1990, the Executive Committee approved the following FCSC
proposals for inclusion in comprehensive court reform legislation:

               Concerning diversity jurisdictionI6 to specify that the jurisdictional
               floor does not include non-economic damages, and to raise the
               jurisdictional minimum from $50,000 to $75,000 and index the
               new floor amount.

               To amend 42 U.S.C. Q 1997e to require exhaustion of state
               institutional remedies in prisoner suits brought under 42 U.S.C.
               Q 1983.



        The Judicial Conference has previously supported abolition of diversity
jurisdiction (e.F1., JCUS-MAR 77, p. 8), elimination of in-state plaintiff access to
diversity jurisdiction (e.F1., JCUS-MAR 77, p. 9), and amendment of 28 U.S.C.
Q 1332(c) to deem corporations to be citizens of every state in which they are
licensed to do business (JCUS-MAR 88, p. 23).
To extend the life of the United States Parole Commission, or
create a successor agency, to conduct parole revocation hearings
for "old law" prisoners. The Executive Committee opposed
transferring jurisdiction to the Parole Commission or a successor
agency over supervised release revocation proceedings for "new
law" prisoners. See also "Revocation of Supervised Release", infra
p. 71.

              is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.

       a      To amend 29 U.S.C. 9 160 to provide that National Labor

       a       To repeal or suspend the statutory requirement for specific
               authorization for cost-of-living judicial salary adjustment^.^

         The Executive Committee also made a number of study assignments of
FCSC recommendations. To the Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction, the
Executive Committee assigned studies of minimal diversity jurisdiction; mass
litigation procedure; proposals concerning the Anti-Injunction Act, abstention, and

       7
        An additional item identified as non-controversial was a proposal to
amend 28 U.S.C. $ 331 to recognize the authority of the Judicial Conference
to issue administrative rules. After a Conference member suggested that this
matter was not without controversy, a three-judge subcommmittee, chaired by
Judge Sarah Barker, was appointed to study the issue and recommend
Conference action. At its September 1990 plenary session, the Conference
postponed consideration, pending further review by the Barker Subcommittee.
removal; and restructuring of the courts of appeals. The Committee on Judicial
Improvements, and its successor Committee on Court Administration and Case
Management, were assigned studies of sanctions for litigation misconduct,
attorney fee awards, and chief judge selection. The Committee on Criminal Law
and Probation Administration was asked to study discovery in criminal cases,
and the Defender Services Committee was tasked with a comprehensive review
of the 1964 Criminal Justice Act, as amended, Finally, the Executive Committee
requested that the Rules Committee study whether Congress should delegate
to the Supreme Court the authority to define what constitutes a final decision for
purposes of 28 U.S.C. 5 1291, and .the circumstances in which orders and
actions of district courts not otherwise subject to appeal under acts of Congress
may be appealed to the courts of appeals.

         The Executive Committee also agreed to request that the Federal Judicial
Center study how courts handle scientific and technological complexity in
litigation.

        B. In August, 1990, the Executive Committee was informed that the
long-awaited omnibus court reform measure (to be attached to civil justice
reform legislation) had been introduced by Congressman Kastenmeier as H.R.
5381 (101st Congress). Also circulating was a similar, although somewhat
narrower, proposal by Senator Grassley.' In light of a scheduled hearing prior
to the Conference's September 12, 1990, plenary session, the Executive
Committee acted on the various committee recommendations with regard to
the following items on the Conference's behalf:

      1. Agreed to take no position on 5 106 of H.R. 5381 ("Budget Estimates
of Courts").

      2. Supported 5 110 of H.R. 5381 ("Removal of Separate and Independent
Claims").

       3. Supported the establishment of a separate, enhanced retirement
system for judges of the United States Claims Court, such as the system
included in 5 113 of H.R. 5381 ("Retirement Program for Claims Court Judges").




       8
        Both Congressman Kastenmeier and Senator Grassley were members
of the FCSC. All references are to H.R. 5381, because no bill was ever formally
introduced by Senator Grassley.
      4. Supported Q 114 of H.R. 5381 ("Parties' Consent to Determination by
Bankruptcy Court").

       5. Supported Q 116 of H.R. 5381 ("Appeal of Certain Determinations
Relating to Bankruptcy Cases").

       6. Agreed to recommend three amendments to Q 120 of H.R. 5381
("Supplemental Jurisdiction").

       7. Supported a "rule of 87" contained in Q 204 of H.R. 5381 ("Retirement
Age of Certain Federal Judges"), but also reaffirmed support for the "rule of 80".

       8. Supported Q 205 of H.R. 5381 ("Qualification of Chief Judge of Court
of International Trade"), with a two-year "grandfather" of the incumbent chief
judge.

      9. Opposed any formal name change for United States magistrates
(Q206 of H.R. 5381, "Change of Name of United States Magistrates").

       10. Opposed any change to 28 U.S.C. 5 636(e) related to contempt
power of magistrates (5 207 of H.R. 5381, "[Contempt] Authority of Assistant
United States District Judges").

         11. Supported Q 208 of H.R. 5381 ("Length of Service Required for
Eligibility under the Judicial Survivors' Annuities Act").

       12. Supported a technical amendment (Q 209(b) of H.R. 5381) to allow
magistrates and bankruptcy judges to draw both annuities under 28 U.S.C.
Q 377 and military retired pay.

        The Committee also agreed to recommend the inclusion of an
amendment to 28 U.S.C. 9 332 to impose equal representation of district and
circuit judges as members of circuit judicial councils, in addition to the chief
judge of the circuit as council chairman.

                       FEDERAL ETHICS LAW REFORM

       The Executive Committee approved regulations under Title Ill of the Ethics
Reform Act of 1989, Public Law No. 101-194, concerning gifts, and under Title
VI, concerning outside earned income, honoraria, and outside employment.
                   ADDITIONAL BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIPS

       In order to respond to sharp and steady increases in bankruptcy filings,
the Executive Committee voted to recommend that Congress authorize four
additional bankruptcy judgeships, two in the District of Arizona, one in the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and one in the Northern District of Georgia.

                     STATE-FEDERAL JUDICIAL COUNCIL

         In March, 1990 (JCUS-MAR 90, p. 18), the Judicial Conference approved
in principle creation of a National State-Federal Judicial Council. On the
Conference's behalf, the Executive Committee approved a recommendation of
the Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction that the Chief Justice appoint four
sitting federal judges to represent the federal judiciary on the Council, whose
purposes will be "to consider matters referred to it by either the Judicial
Conference of the United States or the Conference of Chief Justices relativg to
issues of mutual concern to the state and federal courts, to advise the Judicial
Conference and the Conference of Chief Justices on improving the relationship
between the two systems, and to seek methods to enhance operations of the
local State-Federal Councils." The Council will propose a plan for carrying out
its functions to be submitted for further approval by the Judicial Conference and
the Conference of Chief Justices.

                                   VOlR DIRE

      The Executive Committee declined to object to proposals contained in
S. 591 and S. 592 (101st Congress), establishing a four-year demonstration
program in four districts to permit attorney participation in the voir dire
examination of prospective jurors.

                          MISCELLANEOUS ACTIONS

       The Executive Committee requested all judicial officers and employees
who were previously required to file financial disclosure reports to prepare and
file such reports for the calendar year 1989, notwithstanding Congress'
inadvertent repeal of the statutory requirement for filing;9 restricted relocation
reimbursement to situations involving employees grade JSP-12 or higher, except
in cases of heads of offices or divisions, pending a comprehensive policy review
of employee relocation allowances by the Committee on Judicial Resources;


       9P.L. 101-280 reinstated the reporting requirement.

                                       65
strongly opposed 5 103(a) of S. 1972 (101st Congress), which would create a
so-called "Federal Day1', whereby all cases involving persons arrested on a
designated day each month for felony drug violations that would otherwise be
prosecuted in state or local courts would be presented to a federal grand jury
(see also "'Federal Day' Legislation", infra p. 72); opposed S. 2104 and H.R.
4000 (101st Congress) insofar as the bills effectuate retrospective application of
amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by requiring courts, upon a request
for relief within specified periods, to vacate orders inconsistent with the
amendments even in cases that have reached final judgment prior to enactment;
approved a resolution in appreciation of Chief Judge Howard T. Markey (see
"Resolution", infra p. 105); agreed to the expenditure of an additional $5,000 to
reward Ninth Circuit employees who demonstrated exemplary service during the
earthquake of October 17, 1989, and its aftermath; approved a memorandum
entitled, "Role of Committees of the Judicial Conference of the United States,
Committee Chairmen and the Conference Secretary"; amended the spending
plan for the "Salaries and Expenses" appropriation for the fiscal year 1990 to
approve the expenditure of $5,500,000 for urgent space alterations, furnishing
of new space, electronic sound equipment, and clerks' travel, and also to make
available $1,700,000 from the no-year fund for new judges' requirements to
provide for judges' needs in space alterations and furnishings (both subject to
congressional approval of reprogramming requests); agreed that there should
be full disclosure of Conference actions on individual votes, unless otherwise
determined by the Conference; and increased the salary of the part-time
magistrate position at Lander, Wyoming, from $4,444 to $26,662 per annum,
effective September 1, 1990 and subject to the availability of funds.

             COMMITIEE ON THE ADMINISRATWE OFFICE

       The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that it had
considered issues concerning general organization, management, and
administration of the courts in light of continued growth and increasing
decentralization of functions, and referred several items to other committees of
the Judicial Conference. The Committee also reported that it had reviewed the
issue of delegations of administrative authority made from the Director of the
Administrative Office to the courts and determined that the Administrative Office
should develop a proposed delegation policy for consideration by the Committee
on the Administrative Office and the Committee on Court Administration and
Case Management.
                  COMM-      ON THE ADMlNlSTRATION
                     OF THE BANKRUmCY SYSlEM

                   REGULATIONS GOVERNING RECALL OF
                      RETIRED BANKRUPTCY JUDGES

        In order to implement the Judicial Conference policy of maintaining parity
between bankruptcy judges and U.S. magistrates, the Conference approved
revisions to Section 2 of the Regulations Governing the Recall of Retired
Bankruptcy Judges which mirror the changes in the magistrates recall
regulations also approved by the Conference this session (see "Recall
Regulations1',infra p. 94). 'These revisions eliminate administrative problems in
computing pay and add needed cross-references to new retirement legislation
enacted since the regulations were promulgated by the Conference.

                          UNITED STATES TRUSTEES

        The failure of many United States trustees to perform fully their
supervisory responsibilities of auditing case trustee reports and fee requests
and verifying the disposition of all assets of the estate has caused concern that
improprieties may occur in the bankruptcy system. The Judicial Conference
reaffirmed its position that the United States trustees should assume the full
range of their responsibilities as contemplated by statute and that staff of the
clerks' offices should not be used routinely to perform or duplicate the United
States trustees' responsibilities.

                          TRUSTEE COMPENSA'I-ION

        The Judicial Conference took no position on an increase in compensation
for trustees proposed by the Department of Justice. Further, the Conference
opposed Department of Justice-proposed legislation that would eliminate
statutory authority of bankruptcy judges to fix the level of compensation for
trustees, due to concerns that the proposal for mandatory compensation would
diminish the incentive of trustees to perform their statutory duties and would
inequitably benefit trustees who had administered uncomplicated estates.

                      BANKRUPTCY APPELIATE PANELS

       The Judicial Conference opposed an FCSC recommendation that
Congress enact legislation to require each circuit to establish bankruptcy
appellate panels, with an opt-out provision for litigants. Under the current
system, each circuit may exercise its discretion to establish a bankruptcy
appellate panel and to adopt implied consent procedures (28 U.S.C.
9 158(b)).
                    COMMITEE ON M E BICENTENNIAL
                        OF M E CONS~IRJTION

         December 15, 1991, marks the two-hundredth anniversary of the
ratification of the Bill of Rights. On recommendation of the Committee on the
Bicentennial of the Constitution, the Judicial Conference agreed to encourage
all circuit judicial conferences in 1991 to include an event in celebration of this
bicentennial.

                       COMMlllEE ON THE BUDGET

       ALTERNATIVE BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1992

        Anticipating the need to ensure that the judiciary's FY 1992 budget
request is consistent with national budgetary constraints in a period of large
federal deficits, the Committee on the Budget, after consulting with the chairs of
the Conference committees whose program responsibilities directly affect the
budget request, proposed budget estimates on balance lower than the full
funding requests of the Conference committees. The Judicial Conference
approved these alternative, or lower, budget estimates for the fiscal year 1992,
subject to amendments necessary as a result of new legislation, actions of the
Judicial Conference, or any other reason the Director of the Administrative Office
considers necessary and appropriate.

                COMMITEE ON THE CODES OF CONDUCT

       The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that it is continuing to
monitor legislation on judicial discipline and impeachment. The Committee also
reported it would undertake a study of the new revisions to the American Bar
Association (ABA) Model Code of Judicial Conduct to determine whether the
Judicial Conference should adopt the substantive changes and, if so, how to do
so appropriately for the federal judicial system.
                     COMMlllEE ON COURT SECURrrY

                        LEGISLATION TO AUTHORIZE
                  JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO CARRY FIREARMS

       The Judicial Conference approved a legislative proposal of the Committee
on Court Security that would authorize federal judicial officers to carry firearms.
The proposed legislation would overcome what are often varied and conflicting
provisions of state law on firearm possession, so as to allow all judicial officers
who so desire to carry firearms to enhance their personal security.

                      COMMlllEE ON CRIMINAL LAW
                     AND PROBATION ADMINISTRATION

                  SENTENCING GUIDELINES REVISION -
            RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SENTENCING COMMISSION

        The Judicial Conference authorized the Committee on Criminal Law and
Probation Administration to act with regard to submission from time to time to
the Sentencing Commission of proposed amendments to the Sentencing
Guidelines, including proposals that would increase the flexibility of the
Guidelines. The Conference also approved submission to the Commission of
the following specific proposals:

       1.      Change the minimum imprisonment requirement of 99 5Cl .l(c)(3)
               and 5Cl .l(d)(2) from "at least one-half of the minimum term" to
               "at least 1 month", to allow the sentencing court to determine the
               appropriate mix of imprisonment and confinement conditions when
               imposing a "split sentence."

       2.      Modify 99 5Bl .l  (a)(2) and 5Cl .l(c), and eliminate 9 5Cl .l(d), to
               permit probation with confinement/home detention conditions as
               a within-guidelines sentence in the ten guideline cells (those with
               mir~imumterms of from seven to ten months) for which a "split
               sentence" is the only current alternative to imprisonment for the
               full guideline term.

       3.      Permit probation without confinement/home detention conditions
               at two additional offense levels (seven and eight) for Category I
               offenders by changing the ranges in the cells to zero to six
               months.
      4.    Modify 5 5H1.1 to permit greater flexibility to consider age as a
            basis for departure or the use of sentencing options.

      5.    Modify Chapter 5, Part H by adding an application note clarifying
            that offender characteristics that are not ordinarily relevant to
            sentencing may be considered if, alone or in combination, they
            are present to an unusual degree.

      6.    Promulgate a two-part policy statement to replace the current
            5 4A1.3, to clarify that departures due to the inadequacy of the
            criminal history score may be based on either degree of risk or
            type of risk.

      7.    Rewrite the relevant conduct guideline (5 1B1.3), and
            accompanying commentary, to clarify that judges have flexibility
            to individualize the offense level according to the harm for which
            the defendant was personally culpable.

      8.    Reconsider the acceptance of responsibility guideline (5 3E1.l)
            with particular attention as to whether the two offense level
            adjustment should be increased, whether a greater adjustment
            should be available for higher offense levels than for lower offense
            levels, and whether a range of adjustments (rather than a fixed
            two offense level adjustment) should be made available.

       FEDERAL COURTS STUDY COMMllTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

      On recommendation of the Committee, and also of the Committee on
Defender Services, the Judicial Conference supported the following FCSC
recommendations:

      1.    Initiatives should be taken that would coordinate prosecution
            efforts with local authorities in seeking to limit federal drug
            prosecutions to charges that cannot or should not be prosecuted
            in state courts.

      2.    The Attorney General should convene a conference on the
            problems of complex criminal trials.
       The Conference tookno action on the following FCSC recommendations:

       1.     The Congress should enact a comprehensive recodification of
              the federal criminal laws.

       2.     Serious consideration should be given to proposals that "(1) the
              guidelines issued pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act not be
              treated as compulsory rules, but, rather, as general standards that
              identify the presumptive sentence, and (2) the guidelines, and if
              necessary the Sentencing Reform Act, be amended to permit
              consideration of an offender's age and personal history."

       3.     The Judicial Conference should create a standing committee to
              study proposed and actual guidelines and provide advice on them
              to the Sentencing Commission, the federal judiciary, and the
              Congre~s.'~

       4.     The Congress should reevaluate the process by which
              Commission-promulgated guidelines become law.

                  REVOCATION OF SUPERVISED RELEASE

        As noted, supra p. 61, on May 18, 1990, the Executive Committee
approved the portion of an FCSC recommendation that supported the extension
of the United States Parole Commission, or the creation of a successor agency,
to conduct parole revocation hearings for "old law" prisoners and opposed the
portion of the same recommendation which provided that jurisdiction over
supervised release revocation proceedings for "new law" prisoners should be
transferred to the Parole Commission or a successor agency. At this session,
the Judicial Conference agreed to recommend to Congress that any
determination with respect to revocation of supervised release be made by the
district court, and that magistrates be permitted to conduct supervised release
revocation proceedings and make reports and recommendations to the district
court relating to the final determination.

                         "FEDERAL DAY" LEGISLATION

       'The Judicial Conference reaffirmed opposition to the concept of a
"Federal Day" in federal courts, whereby local drug arrests would be prosecuted
in federal courts. See also "Miscellaneous Actions", supra p. 66.

             SUPERVISION OF OFFENDERS FOUND NOT GUILTY
                       BY REASON OF INSANITY

        Some offenders who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity
are thereafter released to the community and often require a variety of social,
psychiatric, and psychological services. Although the probation offices are often
asked to become involved with such cases, there is no statutory authority for
officers to perform services for such persons. On recommendation of the
Committee, the Conference endorsed legislation to amend 18 U.S.C. 9 3154 and
Q 3603 to provide authority for probation and pretrial services officers to
supervise offenders found not guilty by reason of insanity but required by court
order to receive community supervision services.

                  COMMITEE ON DEFENDER SERVlCES

                       APPOINTMENTS AND PAYMENTS

        The Defender Services Committee reported that, during the first half of
the fiscal year 1990, approximately 33,000 persons were represented under the
Criminal Justice Act, compared to 31,500 persons for the first half of the fiscal
year 1989, an increase of 4.8 percent. Of the 33,000 persons represented,
approximately 54.2 percent (17,900) were represented by federal public and
community defender organizations.

        FEDERAL COURTS STUDY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

        The Judicial Conference agreed to implement an FCSC recommendation
to establish a special committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the
 Criminal Justice Act. The Committee would consider such issues as adequacy
of representation furnished by CJA panel attorneys; training of CJA panel
attorneys; appropriate assignment of responsibility for the administration of the
 CJA panel; maintenance of independence of CJA panel attorneys in districts with
no defender organization; selection, term, and compensation of federal public
defenders; relationship of federal defenders to the Administrative Office and the
judiciary; early appointment of counsel; procedures to assure prompt payment
of CJA attorney compensation vouchers; review of determinations of
compensation for CJA attorneys; and any other issues which warrant
consideration.
       The Conference endorsed a recommendation of the FCSC that Congress
provide increased resources to house incarcerated defendants near federal
courthouses.

                   CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT COMPENSATION

      Consistent with a resolution of the Committee opposing reliance upon
mandatory pro bono representation and supporting adequate compensation of
CJA attorneys, the Conference took the following actions:

        1. The CJA revision of 1986 amended 18 U.S.C. 3006A(d)(l) to authorize
the Judicial Conference to increase the specified attorney compensation rates
($60 and $40 per hour for time spent inlout of court, respectively, and a $75 per
hour maximum alternative rate) by amounts not to exceed the aggregate of the
federal pay comparability adjustments authorized since the effective date of the
revision. To implement this authority, the Judicial Conference approved an
amendment to paragraph 2.22 A(2)(d)(3) of the Guidelines for the Administration
of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA Guidelines) to provide for automatic annual
increases in maximum hourly attorney compensation rates, contingent upon the
implementation of a federal pay comparability adjustment and the availability of
sufficient funds in the Defender Services appropriation.

         2. The Judicial Conference also (a) approved the extension of alternative
hourly attorney compensation rates which are currently applicable only at
specific court locations within a district to all places of holding court within the
district; and (b) agreed to establish an alternative attorney compensation rate of
$75 per hour for in-and out-of-court time for all of the districts in the Seventh
Circuit, subject to the availability of funds.

               NOMINATION, APPOINTMENT AND EVALUATION
                    OF FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS

        Under paragraph 4.02 A of the CJA Guidelines, federal public defender
nominees are subject to lYull-field" background investigations similar to those
conducted for candidates for the position of U.S. Attorneys. These are more
costly and time-consuming than FBI "name checks" and IRS "records checks",
which appear to be effective in revealing unfavorable information. Accordingly,
the Judicial Conference approved a recommendation by the Defender Services
Committee to amend paragraph 4.02 A of the CJA Guidelines to give courts of
appeals discretion with regard to the employment of background investigations
for federal public defender nominees.
       'The Conference approved an additional amendment to paragraph
4.02 A of the CJA Guidelines to establish procedures for the appointment and
evaluation of federal public defenders. Among other things, the amendment
gives the courts of appeals discretion with respect to whether judicial officers
may serve on committees to assess performance of federal public defender
candidates or incumbents.

             DECENTRALIZATION OF CJA VOUCHER PROCESSING

       Under a current Administrative Office program, the processing of
payments to attorneys providing services under the Criminal Justice Act is
decentralized in 61 district courts and six courts of appeals participating in the
program on a voluntary basis. Due to the success of the program and the need
to continue to improve the efficiency of the CJA payment system, the Judicial
Conference approved the Committee's recommendation that the decentralized
processing of the CJA Form 20, "Appointment of and Authority to Pay Court
Appointed Counsel", and CJA Form 21, "Authorization and Voucher for Expert
and Other Services", be made mandatory for all courts.

              COMMITTEE ON FEDERALSTATE JURlSDlCTlON



         In response to recent legislative efforts to impose litigation priorities and
time limits in certain classes of cases, the Judicial Conference (a) reiterated its
strong opposition to legislative provisions imposing statutory litigation priority,
expediting, or time limitation rules on specified classes of civil cases brought in
the federal courts beyond those currently specified in 28 U.S.C. 5 1657         a,
JCUS-MAR 80, p. 19; JCUS-SEP 81, p. 68); and (b) strongly opposed any
attempt to impose statutory time limits for disposition of specified cases in the
district courts, the courts of appeals or the Supreme Court. In addition, the
Conference specifically opposed provisions relating to judicial case management
of habeas corpus actions in capital cases and civil actions for certain violations
involving financial depository institutions contained in the Senate-passed version
of S. 1970 (101st Congress), the omnibus crime bill.

                      FEDERAL QUESTION CITIZEN SUITS

       Responding to an increasing number of bills in Congress which would
create private federal causes of action in areas of only marginal federal interest,
the Judicial Conference adopted the following standards and criteria for
evaluating and determining the appropriate position for the judiciary to take with
respect to legislative proposals to create new private federal causes of action
or to create standing to bring "citizen suits" in the federal courts:

A. General Principles to be considered.

       1. Proliferation of new private rights to sue in federal courts should not
       be encouraged.

       2. New private rights to sue in federal courts should be established only
       to further a clear federal interest.

       3. Especially strong federal interest should be shown before invading
       areas that traditionally have been left to state courts.

       4. New federal rights should be narrowly drawn to encompass only the
       matters of specific federal interest.

       5. The legislative history should clearly set forth the federal interests
       Congress believes justify the creation of federal question jurisdiction in
       a particular area.

       6. Congress should provide the judicial resources necessary to meet
       caseload increases resulting from new federal claims.

B. Factors to be considered in determining whether it is appropriate to enact
a proposal for enforcing federal rights by private litigation.

       1. Whether private suits for injunctive or other relief are needed to
       supplement inadequate public enforcement resources.

       2. Whether the subject matter is one traditionally within the realm of
       state law, such as ordinary fraud, domestic relations, or child custody.

       3. Whether the subject matter involves an important widespread activity
       conducted on an interstate basis that creates peculiar difficulties in
       bringing civil actions in state courts, such as large scale boiler room
       telemarketing operations across state lines involving large amounts of
       money.
       4. Whether other dispute resolution mechanisms are adequate or more
       appropriate, such as federal or state government administrative
       enforcement action or arbitration programs.

       The Conference postponed consideration of S. 2754, a bill to create
federal question jurisdiction for a victim of any rape, sexual assault, or abusive
sexual contact motivated by gender-based animus to recover compensatory and
punitive damages.

                      PATENT INFRINGEMENT DISPUTES

        In response to the United States Trade Representative's request for
comment on alternative solutions to discriminatory procedures in resolving
international patent infringement disputes, the Judicial Conference opposed the
creation of a specialized Article Ill Patent Court or the creation of a specialized
patent division within the Article Ill Court of International Trade. The Conference
has consistently opposed the establishment of specialized courts in the judicial
branch (elJCUS-SEP 86, p. 60; JCUS-SEP 62, p. 54). The Conference took
no position, until a specific legislative proposal is advanced, on permitting the
transfer of international patent infringement cases to the district courts.

        FEDERAL COURTS STUDY COMMllTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

       The Judicial Conference supported FCSC recommendations which:

       1.      Endorse legislation to provide that Employee Retirement Income
               Security Act cases involving less than $10,000 not be removed
               from state to federal courts [provided that all claims brought under
               29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(a)(l)(B) not be removable].

       2.      Endorse legislation to authorize pendent-party jurisdiction with
               discretion in the district court to dismiss or remand the pendent-
               party claims if state claims predominate, if they present novel or
               complex questions of state law, or if dismissal is warranted by
               considerations of fairness or economy.

       3.      Support the repeal of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and the
               Jones Act.
       The Conference opposed an FCSC recommendation to:

       Create an Article Ill Tax Court.14 [However, if such a proposal were to
       be enacted, the legislation should be drafted to spell out the relationship
       of the new court to the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office.]

     The Judicial Conference took no position on the following FCSC
recommendations:

       1.     Congress should prohibit th6 so-called policy of "non-
              acquiescence in judicial decisions" under the Social Security Act.

       2.     Congress should establish a small claims procedure (under
              $10,000) for claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (see also
              "Small Claims Procedures", infra p. 94).

      The Conference referred the following FCSC recommendations back to
the Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction for further study:

       1.     Congress should create a new structure for adjudicating disability
              claims under the Social Security Act with hearings before
              administrative law judges whose decisions could be appealed to
              a new Article I Court of Disability Claims, with Article Ill review in
              the geographic courts of appeals limited to constitutional claims
              and statutory construction.

       2.     Congress should authorize a five-year test program to allow the
              Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to arbitrate
              employment discrimination cases with the consent of both parties.




       I4Although the Judicial Conference in 1979 approved in principle a
separate Court of Tax Appeals (JCUS-SEP 79, p.64), it opposes this proposal
on the ground that no exception should be made to the Conference policy of
general opposition to specialized Article Ill courts (e.F1., JCUS-SEP 86, p. 60;
JCUS-SEP 62, p. 54).
             COMMITEE ON INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS

       The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that during the
period February 1, 1990, through August 1, 1990, the Committee had
recommended 64 intercircuit assignments to be undertaken by 48 judges. Of
this number, seven were senior circuit judges, nine were active circuit judges,
19 were senior district judges, seven were active district judges, one was a
senior judge of the Court of lnternational Trade, and five were active judges of
the Court of lnternational Trade.

                      INTERCIRCUIT ASSIGNMENTS FOR
                          EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES

      The Judicial Conference endorsed a recommendation of the FCSC to
expand intercircuit assignments of circuit judges by recommending to Congress
an amendment to 28 U.S.C. Q 291 which would provide for the intercircuit
assignment of circuit judges to sit on other courts of appeals from time to time
on an exchange basis, as a means of promoting education in court
administration.

                 COMMITEE ON THE INTEFINATIONAL
               APPELLATE JUDGES CONFERENCE OF 1990

         The Committee on the lnternational Appellate Judges Conference of 1990
will file a final report with the Judicial Conference in March, 1991, on the
lnternational Appellate Judges Conference, held in Washington, D.C., September
10 - 14, 1990.

                COMMITEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

                       SENIOR JUDGE CERTIFICATION

       The Judicial Conference approved permanent Rules for Certification of
Senior ~udges,effective January 1, 1991. The Judicial Conference also
approved the Committee's recommendation to seek two legislative revisions to
the existing senior judge certification law in order to minimize disincentives to
senior judge service as recommended by the FCSC. These revisions would
permit senior judges (a) to make up lapses in annual certifications; and (b) to
aggregate administrative duties with judicial duties for work certification
purposes.
                  JUDICIAL SURVIVORS' ANNUITIES SYSTEM

        The Conference agreed to seek legislation allowing survivors of judicial
officers to continue Federal Employee Health Benefits enrollment whether or
not the judicial officer participated in the Judicial Survivors' Annuities System.

                     COMMKIEE ON JUDICIAL ETHICS

       The Judicial Ethics Committee reported that as of July, 1990, it had
received 2,319 financial disclosure reports and certifications for the calendar
year 1989, including 995 reports and certifications from judicial officers and
1,324 reports and certifications from judicial employees.

                              ErHlCS REFORM ACT

         Upon recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
delegated its authorities under Title II and its authority for monitoring compliance
with Titles Ill and VI of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. No. 101-194) to
the Committee on Judicial Ethics.

                COMMITEE ON JUDICIAL IMPROVEMENTS

                       MISCELLANEOUS FEE SCHEDULE

       To implement the fundamental judicial policy of encouraging settlement
and compromise, the Judicial Conference amended ltem 21 of the bankruptcy
miscellaneous fee schedule to eliminate the application of the fee to motions for
approval of an agreement or stipulation to the termination, annulment,
modification or condition of the automatic stay. Effective October 1, 1990, the
amended ltem 21 reads as follows (language to be omitted is lined through):

       21. For filing a motion to terminate, annul, modify, or condition
       the automatic stay provided under ยง 362(a) of title 11, a motion
       to compel abandonment of property of the estate pursuant to
       Bankruptcy Rule 6007(b), or a motion to withdraw the reference
       of a case under 28 U.S.C. ยง 157(d), $60.
       In order to clarify the responsibilities of a debtor in possession with
regard to the payment of the $120 fee for the filing of a complaint, the Judicial
Conference approved the following amendment to Item 6 of the bankruptcy
miscellaneous fee schedule (new language is underlined):

       6. For filing a complaint, a fee should be collected in the same
       amount as the filing fee prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 5 1914(a) for
       instituting any civil action other than a writ of habeas corpus. If
       the United States, other than a United States Trustee acting as
       a trustee in a case under Title 11, or a debtor is the plaintiff, no
       fee is required. If a trustee or debtor in possessiori is the plaintiff,
       the fee should be pavable onlv from the estate and to the extent
       there is anv estate realized.

                                  JURY MATTERS

        On recommendation of the Committee on Judicial Improvements, the
Judicial Conference agreed to seek legislation to amend the Jury Selection and
Service Act to permit travel by aircraft within the contiguous 48 states by grand
jurors when weather conditions warrant, after certification of the Chief Judge and
subject to guidelines set by the Conference.

                     ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUI'ION

        Under 28 U.S.C. 5 657(a), a district court is authorized to establish and
pay arbitrators' compensation, if any, for services rendered in each case, subject
to compensation limits set by the Judicial Conference.                 Upon the
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference established limitations of
arbitrators' compensation at $250 per day or per case for a single arbitrator
and $100 per day or per case per panel member. 'The Conference delegated
authority to the new Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
to approve exceptions. The Conference also agreed to allow arbitrators to
apply for awards of excess fees for protracted hearings or cases involving
excessive preparation time, not to exceed hourly rates authorized under the
Criminal Justice Act (18 U.S.C. 5 3006A(d)). Higher rates may be paid by the
parties upon agreement.

       Funding was approved for compensation of mediators for a pilot
mediation program in the Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida.
The Judicial Conference authorized the funding, not to exceed $36,000 in the
fiscal year 1991, provided that no negative reaction is received from
congressional committees.

                        CELLULAR TELEPHONE PILOT

       Due to the growing interest in the use of cellular telephones as a means
of improving the efficiency of court operations, the Committee on Judicial
Improvements readdressed the issue of the purchase of such telephones, and
determined that there may be good reasons for the utilization of cellular phones
in probation and pretrial services offices.        Following the Committee's
recommendation, the Judicial Conference approved a pilot test of cellular
telephone technology in four or more probation and/or pretrial services offices,
two rural and two urban, to determine the effectiveness of cellular telephones in
improving their operations.

                        PIACES OF HOLDING COURT

       Upon request from the District Court for the District of Nevada and the
Ninth Circuit Judicial Council, the Judicial Conference agreed to recommend
that 28 U.S.C. ยง 108 be amended to-include Ely and Lovelock as places of
holding court in the District of Nevada.

       FEDERAL COURTS STUDY COMMllTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

     The Judicial Conference agreed to support the following FCSC
recommendations:

       1.     District judges should take greater advantage of their authority to
              use oral findings of fact and conclusions of law in bench trials.

       2.     Federal courts should continue to use protective orders to
              preserve the confidentiality of sensitive materials.

       3.     The Administrative Office should regularly collect and report data
              concerning pro se litigation for use by a Conference committee,
              so that it may conduct an in-depth evaluation of the costs of pro
              se litigation to the litigants and the courts, and recommend to the
              Conference methods to reduce those costs and improve the
              efficiency of dispensing justice in those cases.
4.    The courts should consider the impact on courts and litigants
      before adopting technological innovations designed to save costs
      in court reporting [provided that this does not constitute a
      retrenchment to old technology].

5.    Each circuit [and district court] should designate the circuit
      executive or another person as the media contact person, with
      training for the contact person and the chief judges in media
      relations.

6.    Courts should hold "press days" to facilitate communication
      between the courts and the media.

7.    The courts should continue and expand publications programs to
      explain court operations to the public.

8.    The federal judiciary should expand efforts to educate judges and
      supporting personnel about the existence and dangers of racial,
      ethnic, and gender discrimination and bias.

The Conference opposed the following FCSC recommendations:

1.    When a court of appeals reviews a case raising an issue already
      decided in another circuit, it should accord considerable respect
      to that earlier decision; a panel contemplating disagreement with
      the panel of another circuit should circulate its draft opinion
      among the remaining judges of the court for their comments.

2.    A representative ad hoc committee under the auspices of the
      Judicial Conference should review policy on unpublished court
      opinions in light of increasing ease and decreasirrg cost of
      database access.

3.    The judicial councils should consider establishing grievance
      procedures for complaints by members of the public of
      inappropriate treatment by judicial branch personnel, including
      allegations of racial, ethnic, religious, or gender bias.

4.    Congress should authorize a five-year experimental pilot project
      to resolve some intercircuit conflicts, during which the Supreme
      Court could refer selected cases to an en banc court of appeals
              for disposition and creation of national precedent on the conflict
              issue. A properly staffed committee of the Judicial Conference
              should monitor the project and recommend after four years
              whether the experiment should be continued, modified or
              discontinued.

     The Judicial Conference took no position on the following FCSC
recommendations:

       1.     Congress should allow each court of appeals to perform its en
              banc functions by such number of the members of its en banc
              courts as may be prescribed by rule of the court of appeals,
              except that the number should not be less than nine unless the
              court has fewer than nine authorized judgeships.

       2.     The Judicial Conference should conduct an intercircuit study,
              perhaps under the aegis of the Federal Judicial Center, of the
              most effective appellate case management techniques, and
              provide a means for the courts regularly to exchange case
              management information, experience and ideas.

                 COMMrrCEE ON JUDlClAL RESOURCES

 FISCAL YEAR 1992 BUDGET REQUESTS FOR SLIPPORTING PERSONNEL

       The Judicial Conference reviewed requests for fiscal year 1992 positions
for supporting personnel, and approved the following additional positions
(subject to the availability of resources):

       1.     Three JSP-13 estate analysts, four JSP-11 administrative analysts,
              and 2.5 JSP-8 estate administration clerks in the six Bankruptcy
              Administrator Offices.

      2.      Twelve JSP-11 deputy clerks for the Automation Training Centers.

      3.      Twenty-five JSP-12 probation officers and fifteen JSP-7 probation
              clerks.

      4.      Two JSP-14 court interpreters for Texas (Southern) and one JSP-
              14 interpreter for Texas (Western).
       5.      Fifty-eight JSPS electronic court recorder operators.

       6.      Forty-two JSP-14 supervisory staff attorneys, thirty-four staff
               attorneys with a target grade of JSP-14, and eleven secretaries at
               JSP-7.

                       ADDITIONAL COURT REPORTERS

        The Conference approved four additional court reporter positions, one
each in the Eastern District of Arkansas, the Northern District of Florida, and the
Districts of Montana and Oregon.

                  JUDICIARY SALARY PLAN MODIFICATIONS

        On recommendation of the Committee on Judicial Resources, the Judicial
Conference took the following actions regarding position classifications to be
effective immediately but subject, as always, to the availability of funds and also
subject to revision following completion of the ongoing comprehensive review
of the Judiciary Salary Plan:

       1.      Approved the creation of two new benchmark standards:
               probationlpretrial services officer assistant I, JSP-51617; and
               probationlpretrial services officer assistant Ill JSP-71819.

       2.      Reaffirmed its position on a ratio of one senior probation or
               pretrial services specialist position for every four line officer
               positions; approved a replacement benchmark standard for the
               JSP-13 senior probationlpretrial services specialist position; and
               adopted revised qualification and entry age standards for
               probation and pretrial services officer positions.

        3.     Approved a certification process for the classification of courtroom
               deputies to full-time magistrates, and approved the reclassification
               of eighty-one courtroom deputy clerks (magistrate) from JSP-9 to
               JSP-10 and ninety-one courtroom deputy clerks (magistrate) to
               JSP-11.

       4.      Approved the creation of a new JSP-12 user support specialist
               (Training Center) benchmark standard.
       5.     Authorized circuit chief judges to appoint an assistant secretary
              at the JSP-11 level when the judge maintains geographically
              separate offices and when one secretary is permanently assigned
              to a duty station in each location.

       6.     Approved an increase in the target grade of law clerks to federal
              judges, bankruptcy judges or magistrates, to allow individuals to
              progress to JSP-16 upon completion of certain experience
              requirements.

       7.     Amended the benchmark standard for deputies-in-charge of
              divisional offices.

       8.     Approved modificationsto the qualification standards for librarians
              and librarian technician positions to ease recruitment difficulties.

                     EXECUTIVE PAY IN THE JUDICIARY

         In order to remain competitive with the executive branch, which
anticipates an increase in pay for senior executives in January, 1991, the
Judicial Conference approved a one-grade pay increase, if requested by the
appointing official, for clerks of the courts of appeals, district court clerks,
bankruptcy court clerks, the Clerk of the Court of International Trade, the Clerk
of the Claims Court, chief probation officers, chief pretrial services officers,
senior staff attorneys, chief preargument attorneys, bankruptcy administrators,
district court executives, and circuit librarians. The Conference authorized
exceptions to normal promotion and time-in-grade requirements to be made to
allow incumbents to be promoted to the next higher grade at the step held at
the time of the promotion, and required that no position other than the court
unit executives cited be increased in grade by virtue of this change. These
increases are to take effect no earlier than January 1, 1991.

                 BASIC ADMINISTRATIVE WORK SCHEDULE
                         FOR COURT EMPLOYEES

        The Committee on Judicial Resources determined that the lack of an
established work schedule has the potential to jeopardize a full-time court
employee's entitlement to retirement and leave benefits, both of which are tied
by statute to work schedules. Pursuant to the Committee's recommendation,
the Judicial Conference adopted an 80-hour biweekly administrative work
schedule for full-time court employees.
                              COURT REPORTERS

        The Judicial Conference approved a Committee recommendation that
an official court reporter receive credit for time spent serving in a federal court
as a contract or per diem reporter for the purpose of calculating the ten-year
waiting period for the five percent longevity salary increase available to court
reporters (see JCUS-SEP 77,p. 55). Such credit would be calculated on a daily
basis reflecting time spent recording federal court proceedings, and would not
include transcript preparation time.

                  COURT REPORTERS' TRANSCRIPT RATES

        When the Judicial Conference increased transcript rates in 1986 (on a
temporary basis, JCUS-SEP 86, p. 61) and 1988 (on a permanent basis, JCUS-
SEP 87, p. 64), it excluded government-paid transcripts from the increases.
Recognizing the hardship this imposed on court reporters, the Judicial
Conference at this session increased the rates for government-paid transcripts
to the same levels as those for non-government-paidtranscripts. Implementation
of this increase is subject to the availability of funds.

                            AUTOMATION STAFFING

      On recommendation of the Judicial Resources Committee, the
Conference approved portions of the report entitled Staflinq for Decentralized
Automation: Support for PC-Based Svstems, as follows:

       1.      Added 305 positions to the FY 1992 budget for automation
               support;

       2.     Added the position of administrative assistant to the circuit
              executive for automation to each circuit executive's office;

       3.      In each circuit executive's office, extended and made permanent
               a personal computer coordinator position; and

       4.     Authorized staff attorney offices to reprogram vacant clerical
              positions to appropriate automation positions, provided that the
              ratio of non-attorney to attorney positions adheres to Judicial
              Conference policy.
        FEDERAL COURTS STUDY COMMlTrEE RECOMMENDATIONS

      The Judicial Conference took the following actions on FCSC proposals
considered by the Committee on Judicial Resources:

       1.      Agreed to support the concept of maintaining a relatively small
               Article Ill judiciary through limitations on the jurisdiction and
               caseload of the courts, but opposed any efforts to set a maximum
               limit on the number of Article Ill judgeships.

       2.      Agreed to support a proposal that the Federal Judicial Center be
               requested, in cooperation with the Administrative Office, to
               develop alternative approaches for evaluating judgeship needs in
               the courts of appeals. Alternatives should include, but not be
               limited to, a weighted caseload approach.

       3.      Opposed a recommendation that the courts should have
               discretion in assigning a title to the chief administrative officer of
               the court.

             COYMITEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                  FEDERAL MAGISTRATES SYSTEM

                           PART-TIME MAGISTRATES

        On recommendation of the Committee on the Administration of the
Federal Magistrates System, the Judicial Conference reaffirmed its preference for
a system of full-time United States magistrates. See also 28 U.S.C. 9 633(a)(3).
It also endorsed the plans of the Committee to review each part-time position
on an individual basis with a view toward eliminating most of the part-time
positions either by abolishing them, combining them, or converting them to full-
time positions.

        In keeping with this preference for full-time magistrate positions, the
Conference approved a cost-of-living adjustment for part-time magistrates in the
same percentage as is granted by the Congress to federal employees generally
in 1991, provided that no cost-of-living adjustment will be granted unless full-
time magistrates receive a cost-of-living adjustment or a salary increase in 1991,
equal to or above the adjustment granted to federal employees generally. The
cost-of-living adjustment for part-time magistrates will become effective on the
same date as any salary adjustment for full-time magistrates becomes effective.
                         SMALL CLAIMS PROCEDURES

         The FCSC had proposed as one alternative to improve disposition of
federal tort claims that the judiciary establish "divisions in the district court
administered by magistrates" to handle claims below $10,000. Pursuant to a
recommendation by the Magistrates Committee, the Judicial Conference
objected to this FCSC recommendation which would vest magistrates with
authority to decide certain Federal Tort Claims Act cases automatically. The
Conference also reaffirmed disapproval of legislation "which mandates that a
district court automatically refer particular types of cases to magistrates." See,
e~., JCUS-MAR 80, p. 34; see also "Federal Courts Study Committee
Recommendations", sudra p. 83.

                            RECALL REGULATIONS

       The Judicial Conference approved an amendment to the regulations
governing the recall of retired magistrates to clear up confusion concerning the
calculation of pay for recalled magistrates. See also "Regulations Governing
Recall of Retired Bankruptcy Judges", infra p. 67. The Conference also
approved minor revisions to the regulations to include cross-references to the
new retirement act for bankruptcy judges and magistrates (28 U.S.C. ยง 377).

        DESIGNATION OF NEW FULL-TIME MAGISTRATE POSITIONS
                    FOR ACCELERATED FUNDING

       In order to provide prompt magistrate assistance to judicial districts which
are seriously affected by drug filings, the Judicial Conference approved the
Committee's recommendation to accelerate the funding for three new full-time
magistrate positions authorized at this session. Magistrate positions at San
Diego, California, Portland, Oregon, and Las Cruces, New Mexico were
designated for accelerated funding in the fiscal year 1991.

                    CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE POSITIONS

       After consideration of the report of the Committee and the
recommendations of the Director of the Administrative Office, the district courts,
and the judicial councils of the circuits, the Conference approved the following
changes in salaries and arrangements for full-time and part-time magistrate
positions. Unless otherwise indicated, these changes are to be effective when
appropriated funds are available.

                          COMMITEE ON RULES
                      OF PRACTlCE AND PROCEDURE

                               BANKRUPTCY RULES

Bankruptcy Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-554) and the Retiree Benefits Bankruptcy
Protection Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-334). These amendments were approved by

        The Judicial Conference approved amendments to paragraphs 6(b) and
9(b) of the Procedures for the Conduct of Business by the Judicial Conference
Committees on Rules of Practice and Procedure. These amendments would

Government Records Center.

                 COMMlllEE ON SPACE AND FACILITIES

       'The Committee on Space and Facilities reported that, in recognition of
the urgent need for issuing revised space standards, it has accelerated the
schedule for submitting to the Judicial conference the revised space standards
contained in the United States Court Desi~nGuide. The Committee anticipates
submitting the revised Desi~nGuide for consideration at the Conference's March
1991 session.

                   AD HOC COMMlllEE ON CAMERAS
                         IN M E COURTROOM

       The Ad Hoc Committee on Cameras in the Courtroom was established
in October, 1988, '70 review recommendations from other Conference
committees on the introduction of cameras in the courtroom, and to take into
account the American Bar Association's ongoing review of Canon 3A(7) of its
Code of Judicial Conduct, dealing with the subject." At earlier sessions, the
Committee reported its initial reaction that the current language of Canon 3A(7)
of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, in effect for almost forty
years, was unduly restrictive and that a more flexible approach was in order.
EJ., JCUS-MAR 89, p. 34.
        After careful consideration of the views expressed by numerous judges
in the system and media representatives, and of the state experiences in this
area, the Ad Hoc Committee recommended, and the Conference agreed, to (a)
strike Canon 3A(7) from the Code of Conduct for United States Judges and
henceforth include policy on cameras in the courtroom in the Guide to Judiciary
Policies and Procedures; and (b) adopt a policy statement and commentary on
cameras in the courtroom, extending their permissible uses. Under the revised
policy, cameras will be permitted in the courtroom during ceremonial
proceedings for any purpose. For non-ceremonial proceedings, their utilization
will be broadened from "presentation of evidence" and "perpetuation of the
record" (as contained in former Canon 3A(7)), to include "security purposes" and
for other purposes of "judicial administration."

         In the view of both the Committee and the Conference, lifting all
restrictions on camera coverage in federal courthouses would not be an
appropriate move reflective of the current sentiment of most federal judges.
 However, the Committee believed that controlled experimentation on a voluntary
basis would offer federal judges the opportunity to observe first-hand the effect
of camera coverage and broadcasting of proceedings in federal court.
Consequently, the Committee proposed, and the Conference authorized, a three-
year experiment in up to two courts of appeals and up to six district courts,
permitting photographing, recording, and broadcasting of civil proceedings, in
accordance with guidelines, also approved by the Conference, which
participating courts would have to adopt and which give presiding judicial
officers the discretion, at any time, to refuse, limit, or terminate media coverage
for any reason "considered necessary or appropriate by the presiding judicial
officer." 'The Federal Judicial Center has agreed to monitor and evaluate the
pilot, which will commence July 1, 1991, and "sunset" June 30, 1994.

        The Ad Hoc Committee was designated by the Conference to select the
participating courts. Upon completion of the selection process, the Ad Hoc
Committee is discharged from further service, and oversight of the pilot is then
assigned to the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management.



        On behalf of the Judicial Conference, the Executive Committee adopted
the following resolution in appreciation of Judge Howard T. Markey of the
Federal Circuit, as follows:
       Judge Markey was the first Chief Judge of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, last Chief Judge of the United
States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and member of this
Conference from 1972 to 1990.

        Chief Judge Markey served with distinction as a member of the
Conference. The confidence and respect he earned during his tenure as
a member of the Judicial Conference have been clearly demonstrated
through his numerous committee appointments by two Chief Justices.
He served as a member of the Executive Committee from 1982 to 1987,
the Committee on Court Administration from 1979 to 1987, the
Subcommittee on Judicial Improvements from 1975 to 1979, and as Co-
Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Cameras in the Courtroom from
1983 to 1984. He served as the Coordinator for the Committee on the
Bicentennial of the Declaration of Independence from 1975 to 1981, and
was later appointed to serve as Chairman of the Committee on the
 Bicentennial of the Constitution from 1985 to 1987. His leadership and
skill were further demonstrated in his chairing of the Committee on the
 International Appellate Judges Conference from 1987 to 1988, and the
Advisory Committee on the Codes of Conduct from 1979 to 1987. He
was elected to the Board of Certification for Circuit Executives in 1973,
and remained on the Board until 1985.

       Of his many contributions to the administration of justice, three
deserve special recognition:

         The emergence of the United States Court of Appeals for the
 Federal Circuit - Chief Judge Markey presided over the emergence of
the first new federal court to be established under Article Ill in more than
70 years. That its two predecessor courts, the Court of Claims and the
 Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, were respectfully consigned to
history and replaced by a national court of appeals ready, willing and
able from the first moment of its existence to execute the mandate of
Congress was the handiwork of its first chief judge, Howard T. Markey.
While his preeminent judicial leadership forged the bonds of judicial
collegiality, his unparalleled administrative abilities were creative of the
institutional framework through which the old became the new without
pause or hesitation. He has left a legacy that will guide all who follow.

      The Codes of Conduct - Chief Judge Markey served for almost
a decade as the first chairman of the Judicial Conference's Advisory
       Committee on the Codes of Conduct. No element of our society has
       been as ftee of unethical conduct as the federal judiciary. In our time,
      no single person has been so responsible for this vital aspect of the
      administration of ju8tice as Chief Judge Howard T. Markey. Countless
      numbers of federal judges sought and received his advice on virtually
      every matter in their personal lives that impinged on their service as
      judges. Under hi6 leadership of this vital committee, our judges received
      the clear, sound guidance needed to insure the integrity of their public
      lives and the sanctity of the judicial proceedings they preside over.

             The American lnns of Court - While many in our society are
      cynical about the future of the administration of justice, the young
      movement known as the American lnns of Court holds the hope that
      lawyers and judges working together can vastly improve the quality of
      courtroom and lawyering skills in our overly litigious times. Chief Judge
      Markey has been a driving force in this movement, having served in
      many capacities, including chairman of the initial board of trustees of
      the American lnns of Court Foundation.

               In summary, when the improvements in the administration of
      justice in these times are enumerated, they will have a common element,
      the energizing influence of a most remarkable jurist, Howard T. Markey.
      t o create new institutions for the administration of justice, to keep the
      conscience of the judiciary during times of ethical scrutiny and change,
      and to participate in the renewal of the legal profession and the judiciary,
      these represent the very highest service to the cause of justice.

              While we will miss his friendship and wise counsel at Judicial
       Conference sessions, we are proud to acknowledge his many
       contributions to the federal judiciary and the nation, and extend our
       esteem and gratitude.




      Noting the deaths of Judge Harrison L. Winter and Mr. William E. Foley,
the Conference adopted the following resolutions:
      The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with deep
sadness the death of the

                   Honorable Harrison L. Winter

on April 10, 1990, in Baltimore, Maryland.

        Judge Winter was a life-long Baltimore resident, a graduate of
Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland Law School
where he was a member of the Order of the Coif. He served as a United
States District Judge from 1961 until his appointment to the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals in 1966 where he served as its Chief Judge from 1981
until 1989, and was a member of this Conference for eight years.

        Judge Winter believed in the Constitution and the rights of citizens
and had a life-long dedication to civil rights and fairness to all citizens.
 He will be remembered as a superb administrator and an exceptional
judge and lawyer. Judge Murnaghan of the Fourth Circuit said of Judge
Winter that he was "one of those with the happy faculty of making up his
mind easily after reflection."

       The members of the Judicial Conference convey their sympathies
to Judge Winter's widow, Gladys Winter, and to his family and ask that
this Resolution be sent to them as a token of their respect and affection
for Judge Winter.



      The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with great
sadness the death of

                       Mr. William E. Foley,

on August 11, 1990, in Washington, D.C. Mr. Foley served as Deputy
Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts from
1964 to 1977 and served as Director from 1977 until his retirement in
1985. At the time of his retirement, the Conference noted the respect
and admiration Mr. Foley had earned from the members of the
Conference and federal judges throughout the nation. We echo those
sentiments today and ask that this resolution be sent to Mrs. Foley as
       an expresslan of our deepest sympathies and as a token of our respect
       and esteem.
