                                               HONORABLE JERRY E. SMITH
                                              Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules

                                Appointed as committee chairs by the Chief Justice of the
                                United States, these outstanding jurists have played a vital role
                                in the administration of the federal court system. These judges
                                served with distinction as leaders of their Judicial Conference
                                committees while, at the same time, continuing to perform their
                                duties as judges in their own courts. They have set a standard
                                of skilled leadership and earned our deep respect and sincere
                                gratitude for their innumerable contributions. We
                                acknowledge with appreciation their commitment and
                                dedicated service to the Judicial Conference and to the entire
                                federal judiciary.

                               Memorial Resolution. The Judicial Conference approved a
                       recommendation of the Executive Committee to adopt the following
                       resolution in memory of Karen Siegel, former Administrative Office Assistant
                       Director for the Office of Judicial Conference Executive Secretariat.

                                    The Judicial Conference of the United States notes with
                                sadness the death of Karen K. Siegel on June 5, 2007, in North
                                Bethesda, Maryland. At the time of her retirement in
                                January 2005, Karen was serving at the Administrative Office
                                as Assistant Director for the Office of Judicial Conference
                                Executive Secretariat.

                                     The Judicial Conference secretariat was created in 1987 to
                                help implement the Conference’s restructuring and committee
                                reorganization, and Karen was selected to head the new office.


                                                                5

Judicial Conference of the United States	                                              September 18, 2007

                               With a relatively new Chief Justice and AO Director, this was
                               a period of transition for the Conference that required a fresh
                               look at how the AO would provide staff support to the
                               Conference and its committees. Karen developed a system of
                               internal AO coordination and review to ensure that Conference
                               sessions would run smoothly and committee staff support
                               would be of the highest caliber. Through her leadership,
                               commitment to the institution, unfailing energy, and hard work,
                               this system – which she honed regularly as Conference
                               procedures became increasingly complex – has been an
                               unqualified success. Each Judicial Conference session
                               reflected the exceptional level of care and concern with which
                               Karen attended to its details.

                                     As part of her responsibilities, Karen served as principal
                               staff and counsel to the Executive Committee of the Judicial
                               Conference. Members of that committee relied on her
                               extraordinary intelligence, excellent judgment, and depth of
                               institutional knowledge, and saw her contributions to their
                               work as invaluable. Respect for her keen insight and intuition
                               extended beyond the members of that committee, and her
                               counsel was sought frequently by judges, including many
                               Conference members and committee chairs, and others in the
                               judicial system. But it was Karen’s personal warmth, spirit,
                               and lack of pretense that turned these working relationships
                               into enduring friendships.

                                    Members of the Judicial Conference will miss this friend
                               and advisor. As a sign of its admiration, affection, and respect,
                               the Judicial Conference conveys its heartfelt sympathies to
                               Karen’s family – her husband, Mark, and daughters, Andrea
                               and Joanna.

                                Government Accountability Office proposal that would require the
                                judiciary to provide to the Department of Health and Human Services
                                certain personal information of individual bankruptcy filers, on the
                                ground that providing such information would be inconsistent with the
                                judiciary’s role as an objective adjudicator of creditors’ claims and
                                because the information could be obtained from another executive
                                branch agency, the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees, in the

                                Committee on Judicial Resources, that Congress should be asked not
                                to include the judicial branch in pending legislation (the Telework
                                Enhancement Act of 2007, S. 1000, 110th Congress) that would
                                redefine telework as it applies to federal employees and would change
                                eligibility and other requirements of the national telework program,
                                and that the Conference’s statement to Congress should emphasize the
                                judiciary’s support for the program and offer continued assessments
                                and reports on the judiciary’s current telework program;

                                rent budget cap;

                               executive salaries to the salary paid to district judges (see JCUS-SEP
                               05, p. 29), and asked the Committee on Defender Services to consider
                               whether it would be appropriate to develop nationwide standards or
                               guidelines for payments under the Criminal Justice Act for expert

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                          The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that it reviewed
                      actions taken to strengthen judicial compliance with ethical obligations, and
                      firmly reiterated its position that the judiciary’s strong oversight systems
                      obviate the need for an inspector general. The AO Director discussed with the
                      Committee the important role it plays in overseeing the judiciary’s audit,
                      review, and investigative assistance functions. In addition, the Committee
                      was briefed on significant issues and initiatives in the facilities and security
                      programs. After reviewing nominations submitted by judges, court managers,
                      and AO managers, the Committee selected two AO employees to receive the
                      Leonidas Ralph Mecham Award for Exemplary Service to the Courts.

              OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

                       MEGA CASE CLAIMS PROCEDURES

                           Section 156(c) of title 28, United States Code, permits a court to utilize
                       facilities or services, either on or off the court’s premises, to provide notices,
                       dockets, calendars, and other administrative information to parties in
                       bankruptcy cases, as long as the costs of the facilities and services are borne
                       by the estate. Questions have been raised about whether claims must be filed
                       with the clerk of court pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 5005(a)(1) before being
                       transmitted to the third-party processor. Noting that such an interpretation
                       would prevent full effectuation of the statutory authority granted in 28 U.S.C.
                       § 156(c), the Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System
                       recommended that the Judicial Conference amend its guidelines1 to clarify
                       that claims in bankruptcy mega cases may be filed directly with a third party
                       processor employed at the expense of the estate. The Conference adopted the
                       Committee’s recommendation.

                           The Bankruptcy Committee reported that it endorsed tools recommended
                       by the AO Director's bankruptcy staffing working group that may assist clerks
                       in adjusting staffing levels as necessary in the aftermath of the Bankruptcy
                       Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, and it reemphasized
                       support for maintaining the bankruptcy clerks’ staffing structure. In addition,
                       the Committee expressed support for the rapid development and deployment
                       of a new bankruptcy administrator automated case management system
                       (BACMS) and approved a recommendation that the AO Director exercise his
                       delegated authority (JCUS-MAR 06, p. 9) to revise the judiciary's guidelines
                       for consumer credit counseling applications to permit bankruptcy
                       administrators to require applicants to waive confidentiality of any proceeding
                       before the Internal Revenue Service concerning their tax-exempt status.

             COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
                      FISCAL YEAR 2009 BUDGET REQUEST

                              After careful consideration of the funding levels proposed by the
                      program committees and the continuing constrained budget environment, the
                      Budget Committee recommended to the Judicial Conference a fiscal year
                      2009 budget request to Congress that is 6.2 percent above assumed
                      appropriations for fiscal year 2008. The Conference approved the budget
                      request subject to amendments necessary as a result of (a) new legislation, (b)
                      actions of the Judicial Conference, or (c) any other reason the Executive
                      Committee considers necessary and appropriate.


                      BUDGET CAPS

                              In an effort to contain costs, over the last two years the Judicial
                      Conference has approved budget caps on annual growth in space rental costs
                      (JCUS-SEP 06, p. 10) and on overall annual growth in the Salaries and
                      Expenses account (JCUS-MAR 07, p. 10). At this session, on
                      recommendation of the Budget Committee, the Conference continued this
                      effort. For fiscal years 2010 through 2017, it set a cap on defender services
                      requirements, excluding panel attorney rate increases above annual inflation,
                      at an average annual growth rate of 7.5 percent, to bring the defender services
                      requirements from approximately $780 million in fiscal year 2007 to $1.6
                      billion in fiscal year 2017. Also for fiscal years 2010-2017, it set a cap on
                      court security requirements at an average annual growth rate of 6.6 percent.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Budget reported that it approved a resolution
                      commending the program committees for their work on cost containment. In
                      addition, the Committee approved updates to non-salary funding formulas for
                      the courts. The Budget Committee was briefed by Chief Judge Joseph
                      Bataillon, Chair of the Space and Facilities Committee, on the Los Angeles
                      courthouse project.

              COMMITTEE ON CODES OF CONDUCT
                       CERTIFICATE OF DIVESTITURE REGULATIONS

                               The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Public Law No. 109-42,
                       permits judges (and certain of their relatives and trustees) who divest property
                       in order to comply with conflict of interest requirements to elect to postpone
                       the tax recognition of resulting capital gains by investing in qualified
                       replacement property within a 60-day period. To qualify for the tax deferral,
                       judges must first obtain a certificate of divestiture from the Judicial
                       Conference or its designee. In December 2006, the Executive Committee, on
                       behalf of the Conference, designated the Supreme Court to issue certificates
                       for the Chief Justice and associate justices and the Codes of Conduct
                       Committee to issue certificates for all other covered judges (JCUS-MAR 07,
                       p. 6). At this session, on recommendation of the Committee on Codes of
                       Conduct, the Judicial Conference approved regulations establishing
                       procedures for the issuance of certificates of divestitures. These regulations
                       are based in large part on regulations developed by the Office of Government
                       Ethics for the executive branch.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that since its last report
                       to the Judicial Conference in September 2006, the Committee received 37
                       new written inquiries and issued 36 written advisory responses. During this
                       period, the average response time for requests was 19 days. In addition, the
                       Committee chair received and responded to 44 informal inquiries from
                       colleagues, and individual Committee members responded to 204 such
                       inquiries.


              COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
              AND CASE MANAGEMENT

                       ELECTRONIC TRANSCRIPTS

                               In September 2003, the Judicial Conference adopted a policy requiring
                       courts that make electronic documents remotely available to the public also to
                       make prepared electronic transcripts of court proceedings available remotely
                       (JCUS-SEP 03, pp. 16-17). In September 2005, after studying the potential

                                                             11

Judicial Conference of the United States                                                 September 18, 2007

                      impact of the policy on court reporter compensation, the Conference adopted
                      an implementation plan that, upon passage of authorizing legislation, would
                      have raised the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) fee for
                      access to transcripts and allocated a portion of that fee to court reporters who
                      create the transcripts (JCUS-SEP 05, pp. 15-16). At this session, noting that
                      the legislation needed to effectuate the plan has yet to be enacted, thereby
                      thwarting implementation of the program, the Committee on Court
                      Administration and Case Management, in consultation with the Committees
                      on Judicial Resources, Information Technology, and Defender Services, and
                      with input from several Administrative Office advisory groups, recommended
                      that the Conference approve a new implementation plan as follows:

                      a.       A transcript provided to a court by a court reporter or transcriber will
                               be available at the office of the clerk of court for inspection only, for a
                               period of 90 days after it is delivered to the clerk;

                      b.       During the 90-day period, a copy of the transcript may be obtained
                               from the court reporter or transcriber at the rate established by the
                               Judicial Conference, the transcript will be available within the court
                               for internal use, and an attorney who obtains the transcript from the
                               court reporter or transcriber may obtain remote electronic access to the
                               transcript through the court’s CM/ECF system for purposes of creating
                               hyperlinks to the transcript in court filings and for other purposes; and

                      c.       After the 90-day period has ended, the filed transcript will be available
                               for inspection and copying in the clerk’s office and for download from
                               the court’s CM/ECF system through the judiciary’s PACER system.

                      The Conference approved the plan as well as the Committee’s
                      recommendation that the Conference (a) delegate to the Committee the
                      authority to revise existing Conference policies to conform with this policy
                      and (b) direct the Administrative Office to issue guidance to the courts on
                      implementation of the policy.


                      PACER

                             The Federal Depository Library program, administered by the
                      Government Printing Office (GPO), provides free public access to
                      government information at over 1000 designated federal depository libraries
                      located throughout the United States and its territories. In response to a
                      request from the GPO, the Committee recommended that the Conference

                                                               12

Judicial Conference of the United States                                              September 18, 2007

                       approve the establishment of a joint pilot project between the GPO and the
                       AO, for a period not to exceed two years, that would provide free public
                       access to court records through the PACER system at approximately 15
                       depository libraries and allow an opportunity to assess the impact of this
                       access on PACER revenues. The Committee noted that providing such
                       availability is consistent with the mission of the judiciary’s Electronic Public
                       Access (EPA) program to facilitate electronic public access to documents at a
                       reasonable cost. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                       ELECTRONIC PUBLIC ACCESS FEE EXEMPTION

                               On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to
                       amend the Electronic Public Access Fee Schedule to include court-appointed
                       pro bono attorneys among those individuals who may, upon a showing of
                       cause, be exempted from EPA fees when acting in the matter to which they
                       have been appointed. Since a court-appointed pro bono attorney is usually
                       provided with a free copy of the case file through the mail, which requires the
                       clerk’s office to download, sort, and package the materials, granting the
                       attorneys PACER access to the case file could result in a cost savings to the
                       judiciary.


                       JURY ADMINISTRATION

                               Jury Service. The Judicial Conference adopted a Court Administration
                       and Case Management Committee recommendation to encourage district
                       courts to examine how jurors are summoned in their districts and to consider
                       adopting changes, if local circumstances permit, regarding how long jurors are
                       on call and/or how frequently jurors are required to serve, so as to make
                       service on juries less burdensome.

                               Employer Retaliation. To emphasize the serious nature of jury
                       service, the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference seek an
                       amendment to 28 U.S.C. § 1875(b)(3) to increase from $1,000 to $5,000 the
                       maximum amount of the civil penalty that may be imposed on employers who
                       retaliate against employees for performing jury duty, and to include an option
                       for community service. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                       recommendation.

                      PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

                              At the request of the District of Minnesota and the Eighth Circuit
                      Judicial Council, and on recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial
                      Conference agreed to seek legislation to amend 28 U.S.C. § 103(6) to add
                      Bemidji as a place of holding court in the Sixth Division of the District of
                      Minnesota.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                             The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                      reported that it considered the impact the E-Government Act of 2002 and
                      pending federal rules relating to privacy protections for electronic case files
                      will have on existing Conference policy. In addition, the Committee is
                      seeking the views of interested groups, including courts, media, law
                      enforcement, and prosecution and defense attorneys, on whether restrictions
                      should be placed on the electronic availability of plea agreements through the
                      PACER system. The Committee also recommended a proposed budget for
                      law books and computer assisted legal research for fiscal year 2009, and had
                      an extensive discussion relating to the congressionally mandated courtroom
                      usage study, which is being conducted by the Federal Judicial Center at the
                      request of this Committee.


             COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL LAW
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Criminal Law reported that, building upon earlier
                      discussions, it viewed a demonstration of an automated statement of reasons
                      prototype, developed by the Eastern District of North Carolina. The
                      Committee also discussed ways to draw upon empirical research and cost-
                      benefit analyses in preparing the Committee’s budget request and in making
                      programmatic resource decisions. Finally, the Committee began
                      consideration of possible modifications to the search and seizure guidelines
                      for probation officers promulgated by the Judicial Conference in 1993 (JCUS-
                      MAR 93, p. 13), based on preliminary recommendations of the Search and
                      Seizure Working Group, a group comprised of chief and deputy chief
                      probation and pretrial services officers.

              COMMITTEE ON DEFENDER SERVICES
                       DEATH PENALTY AUTHORIZATION

                               In order to reduce unnecessary costs associated with death-eligible
                       cases in which the Department of Justice ultimately recommends that the
                       death penalty not be sought, the Committee recommended that the Judicial
                       Conference amend chapter VI of the Guidelines for the Administration of the
                       Criminal Justice Act and Related Statutes, vol. 7, Guide to Judiciary Policies
                       and Procedures, to add a guideline encouraging district courts to set deadlines
                       for stages of the death penalty authorization process. The proposed guideline
                       was developed in consultation with the Department of Justice. The
                       Conference approved the recommendation.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Defender Services reported that it considered a
                       Budget Committee proposal for establishing a specific cap on growth of the
                       Defender Services appropriation (see supra, “Budget Caps,” p. 10). In
                       addition, the Defender Services Committee supported two proposals from the
                       Committee on Judicial Resources: a 10-percent increase in transcript rates
                       and a new intermediate rate for 14-day delivery of transcripts (see infra,
                       “Transcript Rates,” pp. 23-24). The Defender Services Committee also
                       endorsed a policy that personnel benefits for community defender
                       organization (CDO) employees should be comparable to those provided to
                       federal public defender organization (FPDO) employees, and that requires
                       CDOs to conform their leave, holiday, and work week policies to those
                       applicable to FPDOs. The Committee also approved federal defender
                       organization budgets and grants under its delegated authority from the Judicial
                       Conference (JCUS-MAR 89, pp. 16-17).


              COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL-STATE JURISDICTION
                       JURISDICTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT

                                The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction recommended that the
                       Judicial Conference seek legislation to correct two anomalies in the
                       jurisdictional statutes as part of the Committee’s continuing jurisdictional
                       improvements project.

                               Derivative Removal Jurisdiction. In 1986, Congress amended
                      28 U.S.C. § 1441 to provide that a state court’s lack of jurisdiction does not
                      bar the removal of any civil action otherwise within the jurisdiction of the
                      federal district courts. When the provision was subsequently renumbered in
                      2002, the phrase “under this section” was added, suggesting that removal
                      under other statutes might be barred if the state court lacked jurisdiction.
                      Believing that this substantive change was an unintended consequence of a
                      minor language change, the Committee recommended that the Conference
                      seek legislation to clarify that a state court’s lack of jurisdiction does not bar
                      the removal of any civil action otherwise within the jurisdiction of the federal
                      district courts, whether removal is sought under 28 U.S.C. § 1441 or any other
                      federal statute. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                              Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. Similarly, in order to correct what
                      it believed was a drafting error in the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, the
                      Committee recommended that 28 U.S.C. § 1453(c) be amended to clarify that
                      the time for the filing of an appeal from an order remanding a class action to
                      state court under the Act is “not more than” (rather than “not less than”) seven
                      days after the remand order is entered. The Conference agreed to seek
                      legislation to accomplish this end.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction reported that it reviewed
                      several proposed legislative provisions, including a provision related to venue
                      in patent cases to address perceived problems of forum shopping, a provision
                      addressing jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals of district court
                      determinations regarding the construction of claims in infringement actions,
                      and judicial review provisions included in pending immigration reform
                      legislation. In addition the Committee discussed and, based on existing
                      Conference positions, determined to express opposition to, provisions
                      included in whistleblower legislation that would eliminate the exclusive
                      jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit over
                      review of final decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board involving
                      whistleblower claims under 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b). The Committee also
                      received a report on the priorities of the state courts and was briefed on
                      preliminary findings of the capital habeas corpus study being undertaken by
                      the Administrative Office and the Federal Judicial Center.

              COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
                       REDACTION REGULATIONS

                                The Judicial Disclosure Responsibility Act, Public Law No. 110-24,
                       enacted in May 2007, reinstated through December 31, 2009, the Judicial
                       Conference’s authority to redact personal and sensitive information from
                       financial disclosure reports. It also expanded the number of items the
                       judiciary is required to report annually to Congress regarding the use of this
                       redaction authority, and explicitly provided the same redaction protection to a
                       filer’s family as was heretofore provided to the filer. On recommendation of
                       the Committee, the Judicial Conference adopted conforming amendments to
                       the Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United States on Access to
                       Financial Disclosure Reports Filed by Judges and Judiciary Employees Under
                       the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as Amended. The Conference also
                       removed a provision from the regulations referring to a redaction review panel
                       whose term had expired and has not been renewed.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Financial Disclosure reported on its efforts to
                       secure legislation restoring the judiciary's redaction authority (see above) and
                       addressing the legitimate security concerns of the judiciary regarding the
                       public dissemination of personal information. The Committee concluded an
                       Executive Committee-requested review of overlapping judicial branch
                       reporting requirements relating to judicial attendance at expense-paid private
                       seminars and published a comparative analysis chart outlining those
                       requirements. As of July 6, 2007, the Committee had received 3,950 financial
                       disclosure reports and certifications for calendar year 2006, including 1,271
                       reports and certifications from Supreme Court justices, Article III judges, and
                       judicial officers of special courts; 349 reports from bankruptcy judges; 528
                       reports from magistrate judges; and 1,802 reports from judicial employees.

                      LONG RANGE PLAN FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE
                      FEDERAL JUDICIARY

                              Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 612 and on recommendation of the Committee
                      on Information Technology, the Judicial Conference approved the fiscal year
                      2008 update to the Long Range Plan for Information Technology in the
                      Federal Judiciary. Funds for the judiciary’s information technology program
                      will be spent in accordance with this plan.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Information Technology reported that it endorsed a
                      collaboration between the Federal Judicial Center and the Administrative
                      Office to provide and support a network of local information technology
                      trainers. With respect to implementation of the Report on Network Privacy
                      and Security (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 27), the Committee endorsed a policy to
                      ensure the security of the judiciary’s Data Communications Network when
                      wireless technologies are being used and a policy for handling security
                      incidents. The Committee also endorsed, for public comment, a draft network
                      management policy that would enable cost-effective use of the judiciary’s
                      networks while ensuring privacy and security of court information. The
                      Committee reviewed fiscal year 2008 and 2009 resource requirements for the
                      Judiciary Information Technology Fund and urged that the flexibility inherent
                      in the fund be employed so that unobligated funds in the current and following
                      fiscal years are used to finance a portion of any future unfunded requirements.

                              The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that 90
                      intercircuit assignments were undertaken by 66 Article III judges (including a
                      retired associate justice) from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007. The
                      Committee disseminated information about intercircuit assignments to
                      increase awareness and facilitate the use of visiting judges and aided courts
                      requesting assistance by identifying and obtaining judges willing to take
                      assignments.

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on International Judicial Relations reported on its
                       involvement in rule of law and judicial reform activities throughout the world,
                       highlighting those in Africa, Asia and the Pacific Basin, Central Asia, Eastern
                       Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Russian Federation. A
                       representative from the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human
                       Rights and Labor reported to the Committee about the progress of the
                       National Strategic Dialogue in Saudi Arabia in which an Article III judge is
                       participating. The Committee also received a report from an American Bar
                       Association representative about the World Justice Project initiative to create
                       a multi-national movement "mainstreaming" the rule of law into the operation,
                       development, and planning of other disciplines.


              COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
                       JUDGES’ TRAVEL

                               Reconciliation of Travel Advances. On recommendation of the
                       Committee on the Judicial Branch, the Judicial Conference approved an
                       amendment to section C.2. of the Travel Regulations for United States
                       Justices and Judges, Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, vol. 3, ch.
                       C-5, ex. A, to include an express requirement that a judge repay the portion of
                       a travel advance that is in excess of the judge’s substantiated expenses.
                       Although such repayments are presumably made as a matter of course, an
                       explicit provision in an employer’s travel expense reimbursement plan is
                       required to comply with income tax laws.

                               Technical Corrections. The Judicial Conference also adopted, on
                       recommendation of the Committee, two technical corrections to the judges’
                       travel regulations. Section E.3.d. of the regulations was amended to replace
                       an inadvertent reference to the General Services Administration (GSA)
                       locality per diem and meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) rates with the
                       correct reference to the Judicial Conference’s flat rate M&IE allowance. In
                       addition, section F of the regulations was amended to delete an anachronistic
                       requirement for judges to submit duplicate copies of their completed travel
                       vouchers.

                      MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

                             In its September 2006 report, the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act
                      Study Committee (Breyer Committee), established by Chief Justice William
                      H. Rehnquist to study the implementation of the Judicial Conduct and
                      Disability Act of 1980, recommended the establishment of a program to make
                      mental health professionals available to assist with problems of judicial
                      conduct or disability. The Judicial Conference, on recommendation of the
                      Committee on the Judicial Branch, responded by asking the Director of the
                      Administrative Office to work cooperatively with circuit judicial councils to
                      make such professional assistance available (1) to chief judges nationally,
                      regionally, locally or using already existing state or federal programs, when
                      these chief judges confront problematic behavior among colleagues, and (2) to
                      judges who may become disabled or have other problems affecting their work.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that it continues to
                      pursue vigorously meaningful salary relief for judges. In recent months, the
                      Committee has sought to inform the political branches, legal associations, and
                      other diverse outside organizations on the impact the declining value of
                      judges’ pay is having on judicial independence, as well as on the morale and
                      retention of judicial officers. The Committee resolved to continue working
                      closely with the First Amendment Center on planning and conducting regional
                      programs for judges and journalists. In addition, the Committee continues to
                      monitor the implementation of the Judicial Conference policy on privately
                      funded seminars.


             COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND DISABILITY

                              Following the issuance of the Breyer Committee’s report discussed
                      above, the Executive Committee asked the Judicial Conduct and Disability
                      Committee to review and make recommendations to the Conference regarding
                      implementation of the recommendations in that report (JCUS-MAR 07, p. 7).
                      At this session, the Judicial Conduct and Disability Committee recommended

                       their circuits as needed, to implement the following Breyer Committee
                       recommendations:

                       a.       Recommendation 5: The judicial councils should ask courts in the
                                circuits to encourage the creation of committees of local lawyers
                                whose senior members can serve as intermediaries between individual
                                lawyers and the formal complaint process.

                       b.       Recommendation 6: Judicial councils should require all courts
                                covered by the Act to provide information about filing a complaint on
                                the homepage of the court website and take other steps to publicize the
                                Act.

                       c.       Recommendation 7: Circuit councils, through their circuit executives
                                or the clerks of court, should take steps to ensure the submission of
                                timely and accurate information about complaint filings and
                                terminations.

                       The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                              The Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability reported that it has
                       two petitions for review under advisement concerning circuit council conduct
                       and disability proceedings. In addition, the Committee released for public

                              The Saved Grade and Saved Pay Plan was designed to offer salary and
                       grade protection to employees who are downgraded through no fault of their
                       own. In 2004, the plan was eliminated, prospectively, in the course of
                       formulating a short- and long-term cost-containment strategy for the judiciary
                       and the fiscal year 2006 budget request (JCUS-SEP 04, pp. 6-7, 10). At this

                      Judicial Resources to reinstate the saved pay provisions of the plan to provide
                      courts and federal public defender organizations flexibility to restructure, as
                      necessary, to become more efficient and effective without negatively affecting
                      the salaries of their employees.


                      BONUSES

                              Staffing Bonus. On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial
                      Conference approved a centrally funded staffing bonus of up to 15 percent of
                      basic pay (which includes base pay and locality pay), not to exceed $10,000,
                      for employees in courts staffed over a target level who relocate to take
                      positions in courts in a different commuting area that are staffed under the
                      target level. Similar to a bonus program in effect during the period of
                      downsizing in the courts in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 (JCUS-MAR 94, p. 4;
                      JCUS-SEP 94, p. 60), such bonuses are intended to minimize the impact of
                      possible staff reductions on court operations and staff.

                              Recruitment, Retention and Relocation Bonuses. The recruitment and
                      retention bonus program approved by the Judicial Conference in 2001 applies
                      only to key Court Personnel System (CPS) information technology positions
                      in the courts (JCUS-MAR 01, p. 26). At this session, on recommendation of
                      the Committee, the Conference agreed to extend the program to hard-to-fill
                      CPS positions generally, to be paid for with decentralized funds. In addition,
                      the Committee recommended, and the Conference approved, establishing
                      relocation bonuses for hard-to-fill CPS positions, also using decentralized
                      funds.


                      BACKGROUND CHECKS AND INVESTIGATIONS

                              Federal Public Defenders. The September 2002 Judicial Conference
                      policy on background checks and investigations for courts and federal public
                      defender organizations (FPDOs) requires that federal public defender
                      background investigations, conducted both prior to appointment and as part of
                      five-year reinvestigations, be performed by the Office of Personnel
                      Management (OPM) (JCUS-SEP 02, pp. 52-53). Noting that, unlike other
                      court and FPDO personnel, federal public defenders are not provisionally
                      appointed pending completion of background investigations, and that the time
                      OPM was taking to complete the pre-appointment investigations caused
                      hardship both to the individuals being investigated and to the FPDOs, the
                      Judicial Resources Committee, at the request of the Defender Services

                                                            22

Judicial Conference of the United States                                              September 18, 2007

                       Committee, recommended that the Conference modify the policy to authorize
                       the Federal Bureau of Investigation (or another suitable vendor) to conduct
                       initial background investigations for new federal public defender selectees.
                       The Conference approved the Committee’s recommendation.

                               Contractors. The General Services Administration requires that all
                       contractors performing cyclical facilities maintenance and moving services in
                       court facilities either have a background check or be escorted by a court
                       employee. Previously, GSA had arranged to have a National Agency Check
                       and Inquiries (NACI) background check conducted for each such contractor
                       hired by the courts. Since GSA no longer arranges for these checks, and these
                       contractors are not covered by the Conference’s September 2002 policy on
                       background checks and investigations, on recommendation of the Committee,
                       the Conference agreed to modify the policy to authorize background checks
                       for contractors who perform cyclical facilities maintenance and moving
                       services, and to permit the NACI to be used as the background check for these
                       contractors.

                               Selection of Vendors. The Committee recommended that the
                       Conference delegate to the Administrative Office the authority to select the
                       most appropriate vendor(s) to conduct background checks and investigations
                       in the future. This would allow the AO the flexibility to select the vendor
                       who can provide the best level of services for courts and federal public
                       defender organizations. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                       recommendation.


                       TRANSCRIPT RATES

                               Rate Increase. Federal official court reporter compensation derives
                       from both a base salary and the income generated by sale of original
                       transcripts and copies. In order to ensure that court reporter income keeps
                       pace with inflation, the Committee recommended, and the Conference
                       approved, an increase of 10 percent to original and copy transcript fee rates to
                       be effective in fiscal year 2008, subject to the availability of funding.

                               New 14-Day Delivery Rate. Because of the wide gap between
                       ordinary (30-day) and expedited (7-day) transcript delivery times, the
                       Committee recommended that the Conference adopt an additional category for
                       the delivery of transcripts within 14 days, with the rate set at the mid-point
                       between the rates authorized for expedited and ordinary delivery. The


                                                              23

Judicial Conference of the United States                                             September 18, 2007

                      Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation, to be effective in
                      fiscal year 2008.


                      COURT INTERPRETERS

                              Based on established criteria, the Committee recommended, and the
                      Conference approved, two additional Spanish staff court interpreter positions
                      for the Southern District of California and one additional Spanish staff court
                      interpreter position for the District of New Mexico for fiscal year 2009.
                      Accelerated funding in fiscal year 2008 was authorized for the additional
                      Spanish staff court interpreter position for the District of New Mexico. Also
                      on recommendation of the Committee, the Conference declined to authorize
                      one Spanish staff court interpreter position for the Southern District of Iowa.


                      COURT COMPENSATION

                              As part of the judiciary’s long-term cost-containment strategy
                      approved by the Judicial Conference in September 2004, the Judicial
                      Resources Committee conducted a study to explore reasonable opportunities
                      to limit future compensation growth in the federal courts. The study covered
                      biweekly-paid employees in the Judiciary Salary Plan (JSP) and the Court
                      Personnel System.2 In an effort to ensure full transparency, during the
                      conduct of the study the Committee obtained extensive input from judges and
                      court personnel, and the proposed recommendations were twice posted for
                      comment from the courts before they were finalized. The Committee noted
                      that in making its recommendations set forth below, it considered over two
                      thousand comments and made every effort to balance the need to contain
                      future salary costs with the need to attract and maintain a highly qualified
                      work force.




             2
               The Committee also looked at the court reporter pay system, but because that
             system has a unique compensation structure that includes both salary and transcript
             income, the Committee decided not to review it at this time. A later study is
             contemplated. In addition, the Committee on Defender Services is conducting a
             separate study of compensation in defender offices.

                                                            24

Judicial Conference of the United States                                               September 18, 2007

                               Court Personnel System Benchmarks. The Committee recommended
                       replacing existing CPS benchmarks3 with new benchmarks that more
                       accurately reflect the current job duties and responsibilities performed in the
                       courts. The Committee noted that accurate benchmarks are critical to an
                       equitable, prudent, and competitive compensation structure. The proposed
                       benchmarks were developed through extensive surveys, focus groups, and
                       discussions that included peer groups of employees, court managers, and
                       judges and were vetted throughout the judiciary. The Conference adopted the
                       Committee’s recommendation.

                               CPS Salary Progression Policy and Funding/National Performance
                       Guidelines. When allocating decentralized funds to court units, a standard
                       formula is used that adds 1 percent to each court’s salary budget allocation to
                       be applied to salary increases. These funds allow court units to, among other
                       things, pay for default step increases that are given as a matter of course to
                       employees performing at acceptable levels. The Committee recommended
                       that the standard formula amount allocated to the courts for salary increases
                       be reduced to .75 percent, resulting in an immediate savings of .25 percent of
                       each unit’s budget. It further recommended that the number of automatic
                       default step increases be reduced, thereby slowing automatic salary
                       progression, but that unit executives be given greater discretion to grant step
                       increases based upon each employee’s overall contribution, allowing highly
                       contributing employees to move toward the top of their grades more rapidly.
                       Finally, the Committee recommended that national performance guidelines be
                       developed to assist executives in making decisions about pay increases. The
                       Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.

                                Leave Act Coverage for New Term Chambers Law Clerks. For law
                       clerks covered by the Leave Act (5 U.S.C. ch. 63), the court is required to
                       account for their daily hours of work and absences, and at the conclusion of
                       their terms, pay them for any unused annual leave. In 1988, Congress enacted
                       legislation giving the judiciary the authority to exclude law clerks from Leave
                       Act coverage. The legislation provided that law clerks were exempt from
                       provisions of the Act unless specifically included by the appointing judge or
                       local rule of court (see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 752, governing law clerks for district




              3
               Benchmarks are standards of measurement that describe a specific CPS classification
              level and serve as “notches on a ruler.” Courts classify their positions above, equal
              to, or below the benchmarks, and they assign classification levels accordingly.

                                                              25

                      judges). On recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to
                      discourage Leave Act coverage for new term chambers law clerks (i.e., those
                      whose appointments are effective October 1, 2007, or later).

                              Career Law Clerks. In 1978 the Judicial Conference adopted a
                      resolution stating that the best interests of the judiciary are served through
                      continuation of the traditional practice of appointing recent graduates as law
                      clerks for periods of one to two years (JCUS-SEP 78, p. 49). At this session,
                      the Committee reported that, since that time, there has been substantial growth
                      in the number of career law clerks within the judiciary, resulting in increased
                      salary and benefit expenses, greater disparity in costs from one chambers to
                      another, fewer opportunities to promote diversity, and fewer opportunities for
                      new lawyers to experience service in the judiciary early in their careers. To
                      address these issues, the Committee recommended that, subject to certain
                      terms and conditions, all judges in the federal courts be limited to one full-
                      time equivalent (FTE) career law clerk per chambers. After discussion and
                      modification of some of the terms and conditions, the Conference agreed,
                      effective September 18, 2007, to limit judges to one FTE career law clerk per
                      chambers, subject to the following:

                      a.       In a chambers where there is currently more than one FTE career law
                               clerk, those law clerks will be able to retain career status, with the
                               assent of the judge, as long as they continue to work in the chambers
                               where they are currently employed.

                      b.       Any part-time career law clerk whose hours are subsequently
                               increased (further exceeding the one FTE) will revert to a term
                               designation at that time.

                      c.       No individual will be permitted to serve in the judiciary for more than
                               four years in a term law clerk capacity.

                      d.       Commitments made to specific individuals prior to September 18,
                               2007, that explicitly state in writing a commitment to career law clerk
                               status will be honored.

                      e.       These limitations shall not prevent a judge who has one FTE career
                               law clerk from hiring, as an additional career law clerk, a person who,
                               as of September 18, 2007, is serving as a career law clerk to another
                               judge when that judge dies, retires from office, or otherwise becomes
                               ineligible to employ the career law clerk.



                                                              26

Judicial Conference of the United States                                             September 18, 2007

                               Pay Parity Based on Experience. Chambers law clerks hired with
                       experience gained outside the judiciary are often able to earn significantly
                       more than clerks who gained their work experience within the judiciary
                       because the former group is eligible for salary matching when they enter
                       judicial service. In order to achieve salary parity between these two groups
                       and recognize the value of public service, the Committee recommended that
                       the Conference replace law clerk salary matching with pay parity based on
                       experience, with the provisos that incoming law clerks who have prior federal
                       experience may be eligible to match their highest rate of federal pay and that
                       commitments made to specific individuals prior to September 18, 2007, that
                       explicitly stated in writing a commitment to an advanced step salary, will be
                       honored. After discussion, the Conference adopted the Committee’s
                       recommendation with an effective date of September 18, 2007.

                               Chambers-Level Budgets. In response to a motion made on the
                       Conference floor during the discussion of the terms and salaries of chambers
                       law clerks, the Conference agreed to direct the appropriate Judicial
                       Conference committee(s) to study the establishment of chambers-level
                       budgets as a long-term court compensation measure that would accord judges
                       discretion in determining their staffing needs.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Judicial Resources reported that it endorsed the use
                       of the Online System for Clerkship Application and Review (OSCAR) as a
                       non-mandatory, automated, national law clerk hiring program and the
                       incorporation of the existing Federal Law Clerk Information System into
                       OSCAR. The Committee requested that the Administrative Office conduct
                       simultaneously a work measurement study of the pro se law clerk program
                       and the district court clerks’ offices and develop a revised pro se law clerk
                       staffing formula with options to include and not include social security

                       conduct a study of judiciary employment dispute resolution (EDR) plans that
                       contain variations from the Model EDR Plan in order to determine a strategy
                       for assisting courts in ensuring that their plans are aligned with the original
                       intent of the Model EDR Plan.

             COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL SECURITY

                      COURT SECURITY COMMITTEES

                             The Committee on Judicial Security recommended that the Judicial
                      Conference modify its policy on the composition and mission of court security
                      committees to (1) clarify and increase the membership; (2) clearly define the
                      mission statement; and (3) encourage more frequent meetings. Specifically,
                      the Committee recommended, and the Conference agreed to, the following:

                      a.	      that the membership list of court security committees be amended to—

                               (1) designate the chief district judge (or judge designee) as chair;

                      .	       (2) state that each court of appeals and each bankruptcy court be
                               represented by a judge or judge designee;

                               (3) provide that a designee may represent the United States attorney;
                               and

                               (4) include as members the federal public defender, the chief
                               probation officer, and the chief pretrial services officer, or their
                               respective designees, and a Federal Protective Service government-
                               employee representative.

                      b.	      that the mission of court security committees—

                               (1) include three focus areas: assessing the adequacy of district-wide
                               court security, ensuring the effective and efficient use of court security
                               resources while preserving the right to a public trial, and ensuring
                               oversight of the court’s emergency preparedness program; and

                               (2) provide that committees meet as often as necessary to ensure that
                               they identify and address security problems before an emergency
                               occurs and that a minimum of two formal meetings per calendar year
                               is highly recommended.

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Judicial Security reported that it discussed the
                       Budget Committee’s request to impose a cap on the court security account.
                       The Committee recommended that the Budget Committee propose a budget
                       cap of 8.8 percent for fiscal year 2009 and a budget cap of 6.6 percent for
                       fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to the Judicial Conference (see supra, “Budget
                       Caps,” p. 10). The Committee was also briefed by the United States Marshals
                       Service on the status of a pilot project to study the feasibility and costs of the
                       Marshals Service assuming, as appropriate, the court security functions
                       currently performed by the Federal Protective Service in courthouses, as well
                       as the associated funding.

              OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGES SYSTEM

                       SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT REGULATIONS

                       the Committee on the Administration of the Magistrates Judges System
                       recommended that the Conference amend Section 3.03(d) of the Regulations
                       of the Judicial Conference of the United States Establishing Standards and

                                Sec. 3.03(d). The panel shall examine all applications and
                                may, in its discretion, personally interview applicants. The
                                panel shall make an affirmative effort to identify and give due
                                consideration to all qualified applicants including women and
                                members of minority groups without regard to race, color, age
                                (40 and over), gender, religion, national origin, or disability.

                       The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                      System reported that, pursuant to the September 2004 Judicial Conference
                      policy regarding the review of magistrate judge position vacancies
                      (JCUS-SEP 04, p. 26), during the period between the Committee’s December
                      2006 and June 2007 meetings, the Committee chair approved filling nine
                      existing or upcoming vacancies in eight district courts, and, at its June 2007
                      meeting, the full Committee determined that one magistrate judge position
                      vacancy should be filled. The Committee adopted revised strategic issues for
                      the magistrate judges system to help focus future deliberations and planning.
                      In furtherance of the Committee’s long-range goal of voting membership of
                      magistrate judges at all levels of the court governance structure, the
                      Committee recommended that the membership of magistrate judges be
                      increased on certain Judicial Conference committees.

                      interim bankruptcy rules, which were distributed to the courts in 2005 with
                      the recommendation that they be adopted locally to implement the Bankruptcy

                      handful of additional amendments and new rules were submitted to address
                      provisions of the 2005 Act that did not require immediate implementation.
                      The Judicial Conference approved the proposed amendments and new rules
                      and authorized their transmission to the Supreme Court for its consideration
                      with a recommendation that they be adopted by the Court and transmitted to
                      Congress in accordance with the law.

                              Bankruptcy Official Forms. The Committee on Rules of Practice and
                      Procedure submitted to the Judicial Conference proposed revisions to
                      Bankruptcy Official Forms 1 (Voluntary Petition), 3A (Application to Pay
                      Filing Fee in Installments), 3B (Application for Waiver of the Chapter 7
                      Filing Fee for Individuals Who Cannot Pay the Filing Fee in Full or in
                      Installments), 4 (List of Creditors Holding 20 Largest Unsecured Claims), 5

                      Signature of Non-Attorney Bankruptcy Petition Preparer), 21 (Statement of

                      Course Concerning Personal Financial Management), and 24 (Certification to
                      Court of Appeals by All Parties), together with committee notes explaining
                      their purpose and intent. Most of the revisions to the Official Forms are
                      technical and conforming to the 2005 Act. The Judicial Conference approved
                      the revised Official Forms with an effective date of December 1, 2007.

                              The Committee also submitted to the Judicial Conference proposed
                      new Bankruptcy Official Forms 25A ([Name of Proponent]’s Plan of
                      Reorganization, Dated [Insert Date]), 25B ([Name of Proponent]’s Disclosure

                       FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

                               The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                       Judicial Conference proposed amendments to Criminal Rules 1 (Scope;
                       Definitions), 12.1 (Notice of an Alibi Defense), 17 (Subpoena), 18 (Place of
                       Prosecution and Trial), 32 (Sentencing and Judgment), 41 (Search and
                       Seizure), 45 (Computing and Extending Time), 60 (Victims’ Rights), and new
                       Criminal Rule 61 (Title), together with committee notes explaining their
                       purpose and intent. The proposed amendments and new rule (with the
                       exception of the amendment to Criminal Rule 41 and technical amendment to
                       Criminal Rule 45) implement the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (18 U.S.C.
                       § 3771). The Judicial Conference approved the amendments and new rule and
                       authorized their transmittal to the Supreme Court for its consideration with a
                       recommendation that they be adopted by the Court and transmitted to
                       Congress in accordance with the law.


                       FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE

                                The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted to the
                       Judicial Conference proposed new Evidence Rule 502 (Attorney-Client
                       Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver), together with a
                       committee note explaining its purpose and intent. The Committee proposed
                       Evidence Rule 502 after the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
                       requested that the Judicial Conference initiate the rulemaking process to
                       address concerns about privilege waivers. Since any rule creating,
                       establishing, or modifying an evidentiary privilege requires legislation
                       (28 U.S.C. § 2074(b)), the Committee recommended that the Judicial
                       Conference transmit proposed Rule 502 directly to Congress with a
                       recommendation that it be enacted into law. The Conference adopted the
                       Committee’s recommendation.

                               The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure also submitted to
                       the Judicial Conference a proposed report to Congress on the necessity and
                       desirability of amending the Federal Rules of Evidence to codify a “harm to
                       child” exception to the marital privileges, in accordance with the Adam

                      proposed changes expires on February 15, 2008.


             COMMITTEE ON SPACE AND FACILITIES
                      RENT BUDGET ALLOTMENTS

                             In September 2004, the Judicial Conference adopted a space budget
                      check process as an interim rent cost-control mechanism for all pending space
                      requests until implementation of a rent budget cap could be completed (JCUS-
                      SEP 04, pp. 35-36). In September 2006, the Judicial Conference approved a
                      provisional rent budget cap allowing an average annual rate of growth of 4.9
                      percent in rent payments to the General Services Administration for fiscal
                      years 2009 through 2016 (JCUS-SEP 06, p. 10), but a mechanism to
                      implement the cap in each circuit was still needed. At this session, the
                      Committee recommended adoption of a circuit-level rent budget allotment
                      methodology that would enable the judiciary to translate the annual 4.9
                      percent cap into circuit-level rent budgets and replace the interim budget
                      process. On recommendation of the Committee, and in lieu of the interim
                      budget check process, the Conference—

                      a.       Approved a rent allotment methodology consisting of three
                               components (A, B, and C).

                      b.       Delegated to the Committee on Space and Facilities the authority to
                               establish and amend business rules that would govern the rent
                               allotment methodology approved by the Judicial Conference.

Judicial Conference of the United States                                                September 18, 2007

                       c.       Agreed that all newly constructed courthouses or annexes, build-to-
                                suit lease projects, requests for General Services Administration
                                feasibility studies, and prospectus-level repair and alteration projects
                                must have the approval of the Committee and Conference as
                                Component B projects.

                       d.       Agreed that requests for Component B funding for necessary chambers
                                and courtrooms for judges taking senior status, replacement judges,
                                and new (additional) judgeships must have the approval of the
                                Committee.

                       e.       Agreed that non-prospectus projects that will utilize Component C
                                funds are not subject to Committee and Conference approval unless
                                the circuit judicial council’s space action involves an exception to U.S.
                                Courts Design Guide standards.


                       FIVE-YEAR COURTHOUSE PROJECT PLAN

                               In March 2007, the Judicial Conference approved a Five-Year
                       Courthouse Project Plan for FYs 2008-2012 (JCUS-MAR 07, p. 31). Noting
                       that there was an immediate need for expansion space for judges at the
                       courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, the Committee recommended that the
                       Conference endorse adding an annex for that courthouse to the Five-Year
                       Courthouse Project Plan. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                       recommendation.


                       BUDGET CHECK PROCESS

                               Pursuant to the budget check process discussed above (see “Rent
                       Budget Allotments,” pp. 36-37), and on recommendation of the Space and
                       Facilities Committee, in consultation with the Budget Committee, the
                       Conference approved 13 space requests. The annual rent to be generated by
                       these requests will be charged against, and is anticipated to fit within, the 4.9
                       percent annual budget cap on space rental growth adopted by the Conference.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Space and Facilities reported that it endorsed a
                       space and facilities budget request for FY 2009 in the amount of $1.1 billion.

                                                                37

Judicial Conference of the United States                                           September 18, 2007

                      The amount requested for GSA rent is approximately two percent below the
                      4.9 percent rent budget cap. In addition, in response to a request from the
                      court in Birmingham, Alabama, the Committee agreed to consider at its
                      December 2007 meeting whether it should ask the Conference to revisit its
                      September 2005 decision (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 41) to terminate the judiciary’s
                      participation in the building management delegation program.


             FUNDING
                              All of the foregoing recommendations that require the expenditure of
                      funds for implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to
                      the availability of funds and to whatever priorities the Conference might
                      establish for the use of available resources.




                                                                  Chief Justice of the United States
                                                                  Presiding
