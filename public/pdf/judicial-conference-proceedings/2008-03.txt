Judicial Conference of the United States                                                 March 11, 2008

                              Mr. Duff reported to the Conference on the judicial business of the

             EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
                      LONG-RANGE PLANNING

                              The Executive Committee considered the Judicial Conference’s long-
                      range planning process and how to revitalize it. Preferring not to initiate a
                      large-scale planning effort similar to that which produced the Long Range
                      Plan for the Federal Courts in 1995, the Committee determined to pursue
                      with the Chief Justice the creation of a new strategic and operational planning
                      process that would involve Conference committees and operate under the
                      oversight of the Executive Committee.


                      COMMITTEE MATTERS

                              The Executive Committee referred three items to other committees for
                      further consideration. It asked the Committee on Judicial Resources to
                      reexamine the September 2005 Judicial Conference policy limiting court
                      executive salaries to the salary paid to district judges (see JCUS-SEP 05,
                      p. 29). In addition, it asked the Committee on Court Administration and Case
                      Management to review the impact on judiciary policy and practice of recent

                      governance and, as it pursues initiatives to move official records to electronic
                      media, to ensure that the judiciary will continue to have access to its older
                      records, including those preserved in obsolete formats.

             COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Administrative Office reported that it was
                      briefed on, and expressed its support for, efforts underway to improve the
                      Administrative Office’s communications with the courts. These efforts
                      include a review of the Administrative Office’s advisory structure; a redesign
                      of the Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures; and improvements to the
                      J-Net. In connection with its review of the implementation of the 1995 Long
                      Range Plan for the Federal Courts, the Committee expressed its belief that
                      consideration of administrative structures and responsibilities, including the
                      appropriate mix of decentralization and centralization, should continue to be a
                      strategic concern and expressed its support for development of an integrated
                      strategic planning process. The Committee was briefed on the activities of the
                      Office of Judicial Conference Executive Secretariat, major AO initiatives, and
                      AO audit and review activities.


             COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
             OF THE BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM

                      OFFICIAL DUTY STATION

                              On the recommendation of the Bankruptcy Committee and in
                      accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 152(b)(1), the Judicial Conference approved a
                      request of the Second Circuit Judicial Council to redesignate the official duty
                      station of Bankruptcy Judge Stephen D. Gerling, from Utica to Utica,
                      Syracuse, or Albany, in the Northern District of New York.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                             The Bankruptcy Committee reported that it heard from its members
                      who serve in liaison roles to other Conference committees on topics including
                      law clerk recruitment, diversity, work measurement, and the courtroom use
                      study. The Committee also received reports on matters of interest from the
                      Chair of the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules, the Chair of the
                      Administrative Office's Bankruptcy Judges Advisory Group, the President of
                      the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, and a representative of the
                      Federal Judicial Center.

              COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on the Budget reported that it adopted a statement on
                       congressional outreach that memorializes the role of the Budget Committee in
                       preparing the annual budget request as well as a strategy for obtaining
                       resources from Congress. In addition, in response to direction from the
                       Judicial Conference (see JCUS-SEP 07, p. 27), the Committee recommended
                       that the AO Director create a working group, chaired by a Budget Committee
                       member, to examine the establishment of chambers-level budgets as a
                       long-term court compensation measure that would accord judges discretion to
                       determine their staffing needs. The Budget Committee also reported that it
                       intends to discuss program-based budgeting in the judiciary at its January
                       2009 meeting and asked AO staff to prepare materials.


              COMMITTEE ON CODES OF CONDUCT
                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Codes of Conduct reported that since its last report
                       to the Judicial Conference in September 2007, the Committee received 52
                       new written inquiries and issued 51 written advisory responses. During this
                       period, the average response time for requests was 17 days. In addition, the
                       Committee chair received and responded to 54 informal inquiries from
                       colleagues, and individual Committee members responded to 228 such
                       inquiries.


              COMMITTEE ON COURT ADMINISTRATION
              AND CASE MANAGEMENT

                       PRIVACY POLICY

                               In September 2001, the Judicial Conference adopted a privacy policy
                       that allowed remote access to most electronic case files once certain personal
                       information had been redacted (JCUS-SEP/OCT 01, pp. 48-50; see also
                       JCUS-SEP 03, pp. 15-16 and JCUS-MAR 04, p. 10). Since that time, new
                       federal rules of appellate, bankruptcy, civil, and criminal procedure have been
                       adopted pursuant to the E-Government Act of 2002 also to address privacy

                      and security concerns relating to public access to electronic documents. After
                      reviewing the new federal rules, which are based in large part on the
                      Conference’s privacy policy, the Committee on Court Administration and
                      Case Management was of the view that most of the Conference policy was
                      superseded and that only two elements remain. The first establishes
                      procedures for redacting transcripts of court proceedings, which continues to
                      be relevant under the new rules. The second is a list of documents to be
                      excluded from public criminal case files, which is referenced in the Rules
                      Committee notes to the new criminal E-Government rule. After proposing
                      minor amendments to these provisions, the Court Administration and Case
                      Management Committee recommended a revised privacy policy for public
                      access to electronic case file documents consisting of these two provisions.
                      The Conference approved the recommendation.


                      BANKRUPTCY COURT MISCELLANEOUS FEE SCHEDULE

                             Noting that the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule had
                      undergone several revisions over the last decade, and as a result had become
                      lengthy and very complicated, the Court Administration and Case
                      Management Committee, in consultation with the Committee on the
                      Administration of the Bankruptcy System, recommended that the Judicial
                      Conference consider proposed changes to clarify items, delete an obsolete fee
                      (and renumber the schedule accordingly), and make stylistic changes to
                      comport with current editorial standards. No substantive amendments were
                      considered. The Conference approved the recommendation and directed the
                      Administrative Office to amend the schedule to read as set forth below.

                                       Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule
                                       (Issued in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1930(b))

                               The fees included in the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee
                               Schedule are to be charged for services provided by the
                               bankruptcy courts.

                               •           The United States should not be charged fees under this
                                           schedule, with the exception of those specifically
                                           prescribed in Items 1, 3 and 5 when the information
                                           requested is available through remote electronic access.

                               •           Federal agencies or programs that are funded from

                                           bankruptcy administrators) should not be charged any

                               (10)        In addition to any fees imposed under Item 9, above, the
                                           following fees must be collected:

                                               Chapter 7 case or a notice of conversion pursuant to
                                               11 U.S.C. § 1208(a), $45.

                                           prescribed in 28 U.S.C. § 1930(a).

                                           If the trustee files the motion to convert, the fee is payable only
                                           from the estate that exists prior to conversion.

                                           If the filing fee for the chapter to which the case is requested to
                                           be converted is less than the fee paid at the commencement of
                                           the case, no refund may be provided.

                               (11)        For filing a motion to reopen, the following fees apply:

                                           The fee amounts in this item are derived from the fees
                                           prescribed in 28 U.S.C. § 1930(a).

                                                                   10
Judicial Conference of the United States                                                     March 11, 2008

                                           The reopening fee must be charged when a case has been
                                           closed without a discharge being entered.

                                           The court may waive this fee under appropriate circumstances
                                           or may defer payment of the fee from trustees pending
                                           discovery of additional assets. If payment is deferred, the fee
                                           should be waived if no additional assets are discovered.

                                           The reopening fee must not be charged in the following
                                           situations:
                                           • to permit a party to file a complaint to obtain a
                                               determination under Rule 4007(b); or
                                           • when a debtor files a motion to reopen a case based upon
                                               an alleged violation of the terms of the discharge under
                                               11 U.S.C. § 524.

                                (12)       For retrieval of a record from a Federal Records Center,
                                           National Archives, or other storage location removed from the
                                           place of business of the court, $45.

                                (13)       For a check paid into the court which is returned for lack of
                                           funds, $45.

                                (14)       For filing an appeal or cross appeal from a final judgment,
                                           $250.

                                           This fee is collected in addition to the statutory fee of $5 that is
                                           collected under 28 U.S.C. § 1930(c) when a notice of appeal is
                                           filed.

                                           Parties filing a joint notice of appeal should pay only one fee.

                                           If a trustee or debtor in possession is the appellant, the fee must
                                           be payable only from the estate and to the extent there is any
                                           estate realized.

                                           Upon notice from the court of appeals that a direct appeal or
                                           direct cross-appeal has been authorized, an additional fee of
                                           $200 must be collected.

                                (15)       For filing a case under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code,
                                           $1000.


                                                                   11

                                           This fee is derived from and equal to the fee prescribed in
                                           28 U.S.C. § 1930(a)(4) for filing a case commenced under
                                           Chapter 11 of Title 11.

                               (16)        The court may charge and collect fees commensurate with the
                                           cost of providing copies of the local rules of court. The court
                                           may also distribute copies of the local rules without charge.

                               (17)        The clerk shall assess a charge for the handling of registry
                                           funds deposited with the court, to be assessed from interest

                                           • For filing a motion to divide a joint Chapter 13 case, $235.

                                           These fees are derived from and equal to the filing fees
                                           prescribed in 28 U.S.C. § 1930(a).

                                           • To terminate, annul, modify or condition the automatic
                                              stay;

Judicial Conference of the United States                                             March 11, 2008



                       ELECTRONIC PUBLIC ACCESS FEE SCHEDULE

                              The current versions of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files
                       (CM/ECF) system and the Public Access to Court Electronic Records
                       (PACER) system no longer provide direct dial-up remote access because of
                       expanded accessibility through the internet. Accordingly, on the Committee’s
                       recommendation, the Conference agreed to amend the Electronic Public
                       Access Fee Schedule to eliminate reference to dial-up access fees.


                       RECORDS MANAGEMENT

                               Courts of Appeals/Bankruptcy Appellate Panels. In March 2005, the
                       Judicial Conference endorsed a proposed agreement between the National
                       Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Administrative Office
                       that paper case files in bankruptcy and district courts utilizing the national
                       CM/ECF system need not be retained for archival purposes after they have
                       been scanned in their entirety into the CM/ECF system (JCUS-MAR 05,
                       pp. 11-12). This disposition authority was subsequently approved by NARA.
                       Courts of appeals and bankruptcy appellate panels have now begun
                       implementation of the CM/ECF system and should have similar authority. On
                       recommendation of the Committee, the Conference agreed to pursue authority
                       for courts of appeals and bankruptcy appellate panels to dispose of paper
                       records received after December 1, 2006, that are converted to Portable
                       Document Format (PDF) for use in CM/ECF. If the authority is obtained,
                       these courts would not need to retain paper records for archival purposes after
                       they have been scanned in their entirety into the CM/ECF system.

                               Probation and Pretrial Services. A recently released feature of the
                       Probation/Pretrial Services Automated Case Tracking System (PACTS) allows
                       PDF electronic images of documents to be categorized and stored in PACTS in
                       a secure but convenient fashion. In light of this new capability, the Committee
                       recommended that the Conference endorse authority providing that probation
                       and pretrial services offices utilizing PACTS need not retain paper records for
                       archival purposes after they have been scanned in their entirety into PACTS,
                       except for the following documents, which must continue to be maintained:
                       original Sex Offender Registration Acknowledgment Forms, Monthly
                       Supervision Reports (MSR), and any other documents bearing the
                       defendant’s/offender’s original signature, which have been submitted under
                       oath or include a warning that false statements may be punishable pursuant to
                       18 U.S.C. § 1001. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                      PLACES OF HOLDING COURT

                              At the request of the Southern District of Iowa and on recommendation
                      of the Committee, the Judicial Conference rescinded its March 2007 decision
                      to seek legislation to allow that district occasionally to hold civil trials upon
                      party consent in Omaha, Nebraska (see JCUS-MAR 07, p. 11). The district
                      informed the Committee that, because of a change in circumstances, it no
                      longer needed use of the space in the Omaha courthouse.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Court Administration and Case Management
                      reported that, among other things, it reviewed the Federal Judicial Center’s
                      preliminary report on courtroom usage and outlined several possible policy
                      options that could be considered by the Committee and the liaison committees
                      at their summer 2008 meetings, and by the Judicial Conference in September
                      2008. In addition, the Committee declined to endorse the Department of
                      Justice’s proposal to prohibit public internet access to plea agreements, but it
                      agreed to inform courts of the need to consider adopting local policies on plea
                      agreements while emphasizing that such policies should be the least restrictive
                      to promote legitimate public access. The Committee also decided to establish
                      May 15, 2008, as the date by which all district courts should be compliant with
                      the Conference’s electronic transcripts policy.

                      Seizure Guidelines to guide probation officers when conducting searches and
                      seizures pursuant to conditions of probation or supervised release (JCUS-
                      MAR 93, p. 13). At this session, after extensive review of these procedures,
                      and to ensure the safety of officers and of others at a search scene, the
                      Committee on Criminal Law recommended that the Conference seek
                      legislation that would provide to probation officers conducting searches the
                      same powers available to traditional law enforcement officers to control and
                      direct third parties when safety considerations require. The Committee also
                      recommended that the Conference seek legislation that would permit probation
                      officers, whether in a search context or otherwise, to arrest, based on probable

                                                             14

                       official duties. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendations.


                       JUVENILE PRETRIAL SUPERVISION

                               Currently, there is no clear statutory authority permitting probation or
                       pretrial services officers to supervise juveniles who are released pending
                       adjudication. Pretrial services officers do, however, have authority to
                       supervise juveniles after the disposition stage of proceedings, for example
                       pending an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari, and to supervise adult
                       defendants prior to conviction and sentencing. Noting that juveniles who are
                       released prior to disposition may be in need of supervision, and that more
                       juveniles might be released pending adjudication if supervision were an option,
                       the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference seek legislation that
                       would authorize pretrial services supervision for juveniles released prior to the
                       disposition stage of the proceedings. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                       recommendation.


                       SUPERVISION OF FEDERAL OFFENDERS MONOGRAPH

                               On recommendation of the Committee, the Judicial Conference
                       approved revisions to the Supervision of Federal Offenders, Monograph 109,
                       to reflect current knowledge in the fields of substance abuse, mental health
                       treatment, and community corrections. The changes are intended to provide
                       officers with practical guidance that has proven to be effective in reducing
                       recidivism rates for offenders.


                       HOME CONFINEMENT PROGRAM MONOGRAPH

                               The Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference amend The
                       Federal Home Confinement Program for Defendants and Offenders,
                       Monograph 113, to provide more comprehensive guidance on the use of
                       location monitoring technologies for supervision purposes, including Global
                       Positioning System (GPS) technology. These revisions would shift the focus
                       from monitoring defendants and offenders in their homes with single-point
                       location monitoring technology to monitoring these individuals both in their
                       homes and in the community. Since such technology can also be utilized to
                       monitor the location of offenders and defendants who are not subject to home
                       confinement but who nonetheless are subject to conditions of release that limit

                                                              15

                      their whereabouts, the Committee also recommended that the title of the
                      monograph be changed to The Location Monitoring Program. The Conference
                      adopted the Committee’s recommendations.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Criminal Law reported that, exercising its delegated
                      authority to make technical, non-controversial changes to the official forms for
                      judgments in a criminal case (JCUS-MAR 04, p. 13), it created an attachment
                      to forms AO 245, 245D, 245H, and 245I to be filed separately. The attachment
                      will satisfy the requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 3612 that personal identifiers must
                      be included on judgments while simultaneously satisfying the E-Government
                      Act of 2002's requirement that personal identifiers be redacted from public
                      documents. The Committee also amended the Guidelines for U.S. Probation
                      and Pretrial Services Officers Supervising Persons Who Have Been Exposed to
                      the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Who Have Acquired Immune
                      Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), authorizing the recording of defendant and
                      offender HIV or AIDS diagnoses in confidential records within the electronic
                      Probation/Pretrial Services Case Tracking System as well as within traditional
                      paper records.

                      ADMINISTRATIVE DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS

                               On recommendation of the Committee on Defender Services, the
                      Judicial Conference approved revisions to paragraph 2.01E(5) of the
                      Guidelines for the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act and Related
                      Statutes, vol. 7, Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures. These revisions
                      reflect the restructuring of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and
                      resulting changes in statutory terminology regarding immigration proceedings.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                             The Committee on Defender Services reported that, after discussing the
                      impact of remote detention facilities on the Defender Services program, it
                      decided to request the assistance of the Committee on Judicial Security in
                      conveying concerns to the U.S. Marshals Service and the Office of the Federal
                      Detention Trustee regarding contracts for the housing of pretrial detainees. In

                       addition, the Defender Services Committee approved pursuing a contract to
                       survey judges, Criminal Justice Act (CJA) panel attorneys, and federal
                       defenders about program effectiveness and quality of representation. The
                       Committee voted to support compensation, at the non-capital CJA panel
                       attorney hourly rate, for the panel attorney members of the Defender Services
                       Advisory Group, for the time they spend attending Administrative Office
                       advisory or working group meetings and Committee meetings.


              COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL-STATE JURISDICTION
                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction reviewed provisions in
                       proposed legislation to amend the Prison Litigation Reform Act and to limit the
                       enforceability of certain arbitration agreements, as well as proposed changes to
                       administrative procedures for review of claims for Social Security disability
                       benefits. It also received a report on issues of concern to state courts,
                       particularly court security and judicial independence, and discussed ways it
                       could be more active in pursuing federal-state judicial relations. The
                       Committee was briefed on the preliminary analysis of a study of capital habeas
                       corpus proceedings being undertaken by the Administrative Office and the
                       Federal Judicial Center and discussed proposed Department of Justice
                       regulations related to the certification of states under chapter 154 of title 28,
                       United States Code, which establishes time limits for federal judicial review of
                       capital habeas petitions.


              COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Financial Disclosure reported on its efforts to obtain
                       an extension of the judiciary's redaction authority for financial disclosure
                       reports (Congress has recently extended it through December 31, 2011), and
                       that it continues to work with the Administrative Office to encourage Congress
                       to enact permanent redaction authority for the judiciary. The Committee began
                       development of a system for the electronic filing and management of financial
                       disclosure reports. As of December 31, 2007, the Committee had received
                       4,288 financial disclosure reports and certifications for calendar year 2006,
                       including 1,361 reports and certifications from Supreme Court justices, Article

              COMMITTEE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Information Technology reported that with respect
                      to implementation of the Report on Network Privacy and Security (JCUS-
                      SEP 05, p. 27), it endorsed a policy statement establishing a framework for the
                      national information technology program, along with baseline security and
                      privacy recommendations. It also reported that the effort to identify and
                      implement cost-effective service delivery models has come to a successful
                      conclusion with the consolidation of servers for several national systems,
                      which will result in cost savings or avoidances totaling millions of dollars over
                      the next five years. The Committee made decisions on fiscal year 2008 Edwin
                      L. Nelson Local Initiatives Program grants and determined that grants should
                      have a two-year limit. In addition, the Committee reported that it will work
                      with the Committee on Space and Facilities to develop a long-range plan to
                      address the judiciary's communication infrastructure.

                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments reported that 98 intercircuit
                      assignments were undertaken by 68 Article III judges from July 1, 2007 to
                      December 31, 2007. During calendar year 2007, 189 intercircuit assignments
                      were processed by the Committee and approved by the Chief Justice, an
                      increase of more than 26 percent over the last five years. The Committee
                      continued to disseminate information about intercircuit assignments, and it
                      aided courts requesting assistance by identifying and obtaining judges willing
                      to take assignments.

                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on International Judicial Relations reported on its
                       involvement in rule of law and judicial reform activities throughout the world,
                       highlighting those in Africa, Asia and the Pacific Basin, Canada, Central Asia,
                       Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Russian Federation. The
                       Committee received reports from the U.S. State Department’s Office of the
                       Coordinator of Assistance to Europe and Eurasia, the Director of the U.S.
                       Agency for International Development’s Democracy and Governance Office,
                       and the Director of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Overseas Prosecutorial
                       Training and Development Office. The Committee also received a special
                       report from the founding dean and chancellor of the new Peking University
                       School of Transnational Law in Beijing, China.


              COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
                       JUDICIAL SURVIVORS’ ANNUITIES SYSTEM

                               Open Season. At the request of the Committee on the Judicial Branch,
                       the Administrative Office initiated a study of the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities
                       System (JSAS) to determine whether JSAS is equitable in its coverage and cost
                       when compared to other survivor benefit programs. After considering this
                       study, the Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference seek
                       legislation that would authorize a one-time open season for judges who
                       previously opted not to enroll in JSAS, with the following conditions: (a) such
                       enrollees, while in active or senior status, would be required to pay 2.75
                       percent of future pay (instead of the 2.2 percent for current enrollees) to
                       maintain the current employer contribution of 1.48 percent, and (b) these new
                       enrollees would be permitted to make a deposit equaling approximately 2.75
                       percent of salary, plus 3 percent annual, compounded interest, for the last 18
                       months of prior service, to receive the credit for prior judicial service required
                       for immediate coverage and protection of the enrollees’ survivors. The
                       Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.

                               Restoration of Survivors’ Annuities. Currently, a spouse’s JSAS
                       annuity rights are forfeited if he or she remarries before attaining age 55. A
                       bill pending in the 110th Congress would amend 28 U.S.C. § 376(h)(2) to
                       restore a judicial survivor’s spousal annuity upon the termination or dissolution
                       of a subsequent remarriage by annulment, death, or divorce and would also

                                                              19

                      provide for a lump sum retroactive payment dating back to termination of the
                      survivor’s annuity. On recommendation of the Committee, which noted that
                      survivor benefits for other federal employees provide for restoration of benefits
                      beginning on the date the remarriage ended, and not the date benefits
                      terminated, the Conference agreed to seek legislation that would permit the
                      resumption of periodic payments of JSAS survivor benefits following
                      termination of a judicial survivor’s remarriage, but would limit any lump-sum
                      retroactive payments to the time beginning on the date the survivor’s
                      remarriage ended by death, divorce or annulment and ending on the date on
                      which periodic annuity payments resumed.


                      JUDGES’ TRAVEL REGULATIONS

                              Same-Day Travel. The Committee recommended, and the Judicial
                      Conference approved, an amendment to section E.4 of the Travel Regulations
                      for United States Justices and Judges, Guide to Judiciary Policies and
                      Procedures, vol. 3, ch. C-5, ex. A, to clarify and specify the nature and amount
                      of a judge’s entitlement to reimbursement for the expenses of meals and
                      incidentals incurred in same-day travel.

                               Tips to Parking Attendants. On recommendation of the Committee, the
                      Conference approved an amendment to section F.2. of the judges’ travel
                      regulations specifically to authorize reimbursement of judges for the cost of
                      tips to parking attendants.

                               Inter-District Meetings. The Conference also agreed to a
                      recommendation of the Committee to amend section B.3 of the judges’ travel
                      regulations to add a new subsection giving chief judges in states with multiple
                      districts the discretion to hold one inter-district meeting annually. Judges who
                      attend such a meeting may be reimbursed for their transportation and
                      subsistence expenses.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on the Judicial Branch reported that, consistent with the
                      priorities of the Chief Justice and the Judicial Conference, it continues to
                      devote substantial attention to judicial salary restoration. The Committee is
                      working closely with the Chief Justice's Ad Hoc Committee on Judicial
                      Salaries to secure enactment of judges' pay restoration legislation. The
                      Committee also reported on matters related to judicial benefits and on its

                       efforts to improve public knowledge about the role of the federal courts and the
                       importance of an independent judiciary.


              COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND DISABILITY
                       RULES FOR JUDICIAL-CONDUCT AND JUDICIAL-DISABILITY
                       PROCEEDINGS

                               In September 2006, the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act Study
                       Committee, known as the Breyer Committee, established by Chief Justice
                       William H. Rehnquist, issued a report and recommendations regarding
                       implementation of the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act. Among its
                       responses to that report, in March 2007, the Judicial Conference directed the
                       Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability to develop comprehensive
                       guidelines and rules as needed to implement the Judicial Conduct and
                       Disability Act consistently in all federal courts. At this session, the Committee
                       proposed, and the Conference approved under 28 U.S.C. § 358, Rules for
                       Judicial-Conduct and Judicial-Disability Proceedings, which are binding and
                       operate uniformly, nationwide, superseding any conflicting judicial council
                       rules. The rules were subjected to extensive review and comment from judges,
                       court staff, and the general public prior to their adoption.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability reported that it
                       issued two decisions in January 2008 on petitions for review of circuit council
                       conduct and disability orders. It currently has a matter under advisement upon
                       certification from a circuit council.


              COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL RESOURCES
                       COMPENSATORY TIME

                               In March 1996, the Judicial Conference adopted a compensatory time
                       policy for court employees, which, though optional as to whether courts allow
                       compensatory time, mandates that certain elements be included in the policies
                       of those court units that do (JCUS-MAR 96, p. 28). At this session, on
                       recommendation of the Committee on Judicial Resources, the Conference


                                                              21
Judicial Conference of the United States                                                March 11, 2008

                      adopted three changes to the policy in order to provide courts with more
                      flexibility in the use of compensatory time. These changes (a) allow courts to
                      provide compensatory time when employees are required to travel outside of
                      their normal work schedules; (b) reduce the minimum time increment for
                      compensatory time from one hour to 15 minutes; and (c) extend the period for
                      using compensatory time from six months to one year. The compensatory time
                      policy can be found in vol. 1, ch. 10, subchap. 1550.2 of the Guide to Judiciary
                      Policies and Procedures.


                      SICK LEAVE CREDIT FOR FERS EMPLOYEES

                              Nearly all federal employees are covered by one of two statutory
                      retirement systems – the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or the
                      Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). CSRS employees, unlike FERS
                      employees, receive service credit if they retire with unused sick leave balances.
                      The Committee noted that this benefit provides an incentive to CSRS
                      employees to use their sick leave prudently and results in less absenteeism and
                      greater productivity. In response to a recent expression of interest on the part
                      of some members of Congress in amending FERS to allow some form of sick
                      leave credit, the Committee recommended that the Conference express to the
                      congressional sponsors and the Office of Personnel Management the support of
                      the judiciary for changes to improve the crediting of unused sick leave for
                      employees who retire under FERS. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                      recommendation.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on Judicial Resources reported that it strongly supports
                      taking a conservative approach to fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budget issues and
                      continuing to promote cost-containment initiatives. It unanimously agreed
                      that, if judicial salary restoration were approved by Congress in 2008, no
                      change to the current interim executive compensation policy would be
                      necessary since the policy adequately provides for additional locality pay to
                      judiciary executives, especially in high-cost areas. The Committee did,
                      however, request that a study of executive compensation be conducted and that
                      the results be presented at its December 2008 meeting. The Committee also
                      asked its ad hoc diversity subcommittee to review the judiciary's Model
                      Employment Dispute Resolution (EDR) Plan, as well as court EDR plans, to
                      provide proposals for dealing with variances between courts' EDR plan

                       Model EDR Plan are needed.


              COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL SECURITY
                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                                The Committee on Judicial Security reported that it authorized the
                       United States Marshals Service (USMS) to initiate a pilot program at seven
                       sites in furtherance of the action taken by the Conference in March 2007 to
                       “support the efforts of the [USMS], through administrative and/or legislative
                       remedies, to assume the security functions currently performed by the Federal
                       Protective Service in courthouses, as appropriate, and the associated funding”
                       (JCUS-MAR 07, p. 26). The pilot program will test the feasibility of having
                       all perimeter security guarding and equipment and systems monitoring under
                       the authority and control of the district U.S. marshal, in order to provide courts
                       with more efficient and operationally effective perimeter security. The
                       Committee also considered the use of electronic communications devices in
                       courthouses and made recommendations to the Committee on Court
                       Administration and Case Management on updating guidance on this subject,
                       and it approved new credentials for circuit executives.


              COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATION
              OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGES SYSTEM

                       APPOINTMENT REGULATIONS

                              The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System
                       recommended that the Judicial Conference amend section 3.03(b) of the
                       Regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United States Establishing
                       Standards and Procedures for the Appointment and Reappointment of United
                       States Magistrate Judges to provide that a court or merit selection panel may
                       publicize the names of applicants for magistrate judge positions, with the
                       applicants’ written permission, for the purpose of soliciting comments from the
                       bar and the public. The Conference adopted the Committee’s
                       recommendation.




                                                               23

                      CHANGES IN MAGISTRATE JUDGE POSITIONS

                              After consideration of the report of the Committee on the
                      Administration of the Magistrate Judges System and the recommendations of
                      the Director of the Administrative Office, the respective district courts, and the
                      judicial councils of the circuits, the Judicial Conference approved the
                      following changes in positions, salaries, locations, and arrangements for full-
                      time and part-time magistrate judge positions. Changes with a budgetary
                      impact are to be effective when appropriated funds are available.

                       District of Wyoming

                       1.       Increased the salary of the part-time magistrate judge position at Casper
                                from Level 6 ($13,073 per annum) to Level 4 ($39,227 per annum).

                       2.       Increased the salary of the part-time magistrate judge position at Green

                                arrangements of the magistrate judge positions in the district.


                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                               The Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System
                       reported that pursuant to the September 2004 Judicial Conference policy
                       regarding the review of magistrate judge position vacancies (JCUS-SEP 04,
                       p. 26), during the period between the Committee's June 2007 and December
                       2007 meetings, the Committee chair approved filling nine magistrate judge
                       position vacancies, and, at its December 2007 meeting, the full Committee
                       determined that four magistrate judge position vacancies should be filled. The
                       Committee discussed a problem identified in the FBI background investigation
                       procedure required for all magistrate judge selectees and voted to advise the
                       FBI to include in its investigation instructions a statement that nothing in the
                       instructions should be construed as requiring the selectee to provide names of
                       prosecutors, law enforcement personnel, or others in particular positions, even
                       where the selectee knows no such individuals. The Committee voted not to
                       recommend a change in the regulation that limits credit for law clerk service to
                       two years in determining the five-year active practice of law requirement for
                       selection as a magistrate judge.


              COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
                       COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                             The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure reported that it
                       approved for publication proposed amendments to Appellate Rule 29;
                       Bankruptcy Rules 1007, 1019, 4004, and 7001; and Criminal Rules 5, 12.3,

                                                               25

                      and 21. The amendments are expected to be published for comment in August
                      2008. The Advisory Committees on Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil, and
                      Criminal Rules are reviewing comments to 91 rules amendments published in
                      August 2007, which are intended to simplify and reduce inconsistencies in the
                      computation of time periods under the procedural rules and would extend
                      virtually all short time deadlines under the rules to account for elimination of
                      weekends and holidays in computing relevant time periods.


             COMMITTEE ON SPACE AND FACILITIES
                      ASSET MANAGEMENT PLANNING

                              In March 2006, the Judicial Conference approved, in concept, asset
                      management planning (AMP) as an objective methodology to enhance the
                      judiciary’s long-range facilities planning process and as the new methodology
                      for scoring and placing courthouse projects on a five-year courthouse project
                      plan (JCUS-MAR 06, p. 25). Asset management planning identifies the costs
                      and benefits of alternative space housing strategies to determine the best
                      strategy to meet a district’s or circuit’s current and future operational needs.
                      At this session the Committee recommended that the Conference approve the
                      nine key features of the AMP methodology and delegate to the Committee the
                      authority to establish and amend the business rules that will govern the AMP
                      methodology. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                      BUILDING MANAGEMENT DELEGATION PROGRAM

                               In September 2005, the Judicial Conference determined to end the
                      judiciary’s participation in a building management delegation program under
                      which two district courts had assumed from the General Services
                      Administration (GSA) management responsibilities for certain court facilities
                      (JCUS-SEP 05, p. 41). At this session, the Conference, on recommendation of
                      the Committee, agreed to rescind its decision to terminate the judiciary’s
                      participation in GSA’s building delegation program only for the Hugo L. Black
                      Courthouse in Birmingham, Alabama, with the understanding that (a) annual
                      costs incurred by the judiciary will not exceed those appraised operation costs
                      estimated by GSA; and (b) in the event of a catastrophic event or natural
                      disaster warranting repair to the building, the management of the building will




                                                             26

                       be returned to GSA if funding cannot be obtained by the judiciary to repair the
                       facility.


                       EXCEPTIONS TO THE U.S. COURTS DESIGN GUIDE

                                On July 19, 2006, the House Committee on Transportation and
                       Infrastructure passed a resolution that, among other things, requires the
                       judiciary to provide GSA with a list of each exception to the U.S. Courts
                       Design Guide relating to a courthouse construction project that would result in
                       additional costs, along with a justification for the exception and a cost
                       estimate, for GSA to submit to Congress, along with its recommendation as to
                       whether the relevant House and Senate committees should approve the
                       exception. Since the judiciary and GSA have not always agreed on what
                       constitutes an exception to the Design Guide, the AO and GSA have worked
                       together to identify a mutually agreeable list of exceptions, both for projects
                       already on the Five-Year Courthouse Project Plan (plus an ongoing Los
                       Angeles project) and for future projects. With regard to nine projects that fall
                       into the former category, the Committee reviewed a list of exceptions
                       identified by GSA (and in one case by the Administrative Office) and approved
                       the list with objections noted as to those items on which the judiciary and GSA
                       still disagree. The Committee recommended that the Judicial Conference
                       approve the list and the objections noted to certain of those exceptions, with
                       the understanding that the judiciary will continue to discuss these objections
                       with GSA. The Conference adopted the Committee’s recommendation.


                       FIVE-YEAR COURTHOUSE PROJECT PLAN

                               After taking into consideration the projects that received full funding in
                       the final fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for GSA, the Committee
                       recommended that the Conference approve a Five-Year Courthouse Project
                       Plan for FYs 2009-2013 that includes in the FY 2009 column of the plan the
                       unfunded projects from 2008 plus the first two projects in terms of score from
                       the 2009 column of the FYs 2008-2012 plan to replace the two projects funded
                       by Congress in FY 2008. The Conference approved the Committee’s
                       recommendation.




                                                              27
Judicial Conference of the United States                                                  March 11, 2008



                      SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS COURTROOMS

                              Prior to 2002, the U.S. Courts Design Guide permitted special
                      proceedings courtrooms as needed if they were located at district headquarters
                      and in a building with at least four standard courtrooms. In 2002, the Judicial
                      Conference added language that also permitted special proceedings courtrooms
                      for new courthouses planned with fewer than four district judge courtrooms in
                      “states with small, widely dispersed populations” (JCUS-SEP 02, p. 64).
                      Noting that it was difficult for GSA and the Committee to quantify population
                      demographics objectively to determine what constitutes a state with a small,
                      widely dispersed population, the Committee recommended that the Conference
                      rescind its 2002 policy and that the U.S. Courts Design Guide policy on
                      providing a special proceedings courtroom read as follows:

                               A special proceedings courtroom shall be considered an
                               exception if it is provided at a location other than the district
                               headquarters or if there are fewer than four district judge
                               courtrooms (even in a headquarters locations). Provision of
                               more than one such courtroom in any facility is also considered
                               an exception.

                      The Conference approved the Committee’s recommendation.


                      COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES

                              The Committee on Space and Facilities reported that it updated the
                      Conference on the status of the circuit rent budget (CRB) allotment program,
                      noting that fiscal year 2008 is the pilot year for the program. Pursuant to the
                      procedures established for the CRB program, the Committee considered and
                      approved one request for chambers for a replacement judge for the Fifth
                      Circuit Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas. The Committee also updated the
                      Conference on the progress of the rent validation program, specifically the
                      steps the Committee and AO are taking to ensure that the local courts are in a
                      position to maintain the accuracy of the information upon which rent is based.

              FUNDING
                               All of the foregoing recommendations that require the expenditure of
                       funds for implementation were approved by the Judicial Conference subject to
                       the availability of funds and to whatever priorities the Conference might
                       establish for the use of available resources.
